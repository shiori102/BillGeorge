      "<p>With COVID-19 raging at all-time levels throughout U.S., highly efficacious vaccines are coming, but in limited supply. That raises the question, who will get priority? Lobbying by big unions and large companies to get their employees vaccinated first is intense. This lobbying risks leaving non-union employees, small businesses and individual practitioners out in the cold. On Monday, December 21, I shared my views on this subject on CNBC’s Squawk on the Street (https://cnb.cx/37DQrRy).</p><p>On Sunday afternoon the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) vaccine advisory committee rearranged priorities for vaccine distribution. With health care workers and those in long-term care facilities receiving their vaccines in December as Group 1a, CDC has designated people 75 and older and a select group of essential workers as Group 1b. They will be next in line after health care workers and employees of long-term care facilities. Included in this latter group are K-12 teachers and staff, day care; food and agriculture workers; correctional facilities; postal and public transit workers; and manufacturing and grocery store workers – a total of 49 million people in 1b.</p><p>With the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines now approved in the U.S., the two companies have committed to deliver 200 million doses for 100 million people by the end of February. This of course does not take in account any unforeseen manufacturing glitches and distribution problems, both of which are quite possible. That is just enough doses for Groups 1a and 1b. Meanwhile, big unions and big companies are lobbying furiously to get their people vaccinated. They have now shifted their lobbying from the CDC to the statehouses, most of whom have not set up clear priorities for distribution. Lobbyists for Amazon, Uber, Lyft, and United Food Union are pressing hard form their members to gain early access (https://wapo.st/3h61Axz).</p><p>Yet their employees for the most part have secure jobs and the companies have adequate financial resources to keep going until the U.S. economy recovers. Not so for small businesses and individual practitioners whose financial resources are depleted and may not survive the cold winter months. Their non-union workers are at greatest risk of finding themselves out of work with nowhere to turn. If they do not get early access, the risk is that they will close their doors, causing the economic recovery to take much longer. If this were to happen, low-wage workers, many of whom are people of color, will suffer the economic consequences, while the large companies continue to flourish.</p><p>The solution? States and municipalities should set up vaccine advisory councils, independent of lobbying influence, to make determinations for vaccine priority distribution. Their priorities should be focused on people and businesses with the greatest health care and economic risk. If they get themselves and their employees vaccinated, these individual practitioners and small businesses can give confidence to consumers to return to using their services, which is essential for economic recovery.</p><p>Meanwhile, big companies and big unions should “stay in their lanes” and wait their turn to get their employees vaccinated. To their credit, Walmart, Disney and New York Stock Exchange have taken this position. Others should take the high road and follow their example.</p><p>In this way we can ensure equity in the distribution process and a faster economic recovery.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>As Thanksgiving 2020 arrives, it is time to take stock and express our gratitude for all those who have made our lives both possible and fruitful this past year.</p><p>Without question, 2020 has been the most challenging year of our lives. The global pandemic hit full force throughout the world as more than 55 million people have been infected with COVID-19 and 1.3 million have died. The pandemic killed more people than any event since World War II. It also triggered a global recession, as economies around the world shut down to protect their citizens against the spread of the virus. It didn’t always work as people resisted even the simplest measures such as wearing masks, social distancing and avoiding crowds.</p><p>In the United States these dual crises, which were inextricably linked, were heightened by the racial crisis following the May murder here in Minneapolis of George Floyd, whose reverberations echoed around the globe. If this wasn’t enough tragedy for one year, political divisions – often encouraged from the top – split America into dueling camps and frequent disagreements about basic facts and reduced trust in medical scientists.</p><p>As the year winds down, I am quite sure all of us are ready to turn the page to a brighter vision for America and the world: a world in which we live together in harmony, where we recognize that all people are created equal and judged – to quote Dr. Martin Luther King – “not by the color of their skin but by the content of their character,” and where we work together to ensure the health and safety of all people and offer all working people economic opportunities providing living wages.</p><p>There is indeed “light at the end of tunnel.” While the virus rages virtually out of control in America and elsewhere, three major companies have announced vaccines with effectiveness ranging from 70% to 95% and the promise of producing billions of doses in 2021. While it may be mid-2021 before most of us get access to the vaccine, we can look ahead to bringing COVID-19 under control and a more peaceful year ahead.</p><p>As we gather to celebrate Thanksgiving, this is a good time to be grateful for all that we have and to express that gratitude to others. I suggest you make up a list of all that you are grateful for this Thanksgiving and share it with your loved ones.</p><p>Here is my Top Ten list of people to whom I am grateful:</p><ol>\n<li>I am grateful for Penny, my wife of 51 years, who has been my constant companion throughout this period.</li>\n<li>For our family members, Jeff and Renee, Dylan and Stella and Jon and Jeannette, Freeman and Jade, and the opportunity to watch you adapt, grow, and thrive during COVID-19.</li>\n<li>For our many abiding friends who have been so faithfully in our lives, either via Zoom or socially distanced gatherings.</li>\n<li>For all those we lost to COVID-19 and the joy they brought to our lives, and all those who recovered and returned to full health.</li>\n<li>For everyone on the frontlines of hospitals, grocery stores, delivery trucks, stores, factories and farms who risked their lives to enable ours.</li>\n<li>For the corporate leaders, health care leaders and educational leaders who transformed their organizations overnight to keep serving their employees, customers, and students, especially the medical scientists who created life-saving vaccines.</li>\n<li>For companies like Zoom that enabled us to connect safely with colleagues, teachers and friends in order to continue our work.</li>\n<li>For those who have suffered from discrimination, and yet have risen above it to help others.</li>\n<li>For the 156 million Americans who voted in this fall’s election, teaching us once again that every vote counts and every citizen has the right to vote.</li>\n<li>Finally, for everyone who worked on this year’s election to preserve American democracy for future generations, making this the most secure and fraud-free in our history and putting the Constitution ahead of their political interests.</li>\n</ol><li>I am grateful for Penny, my wife of 51 years, who has been my constant companion throughout this period.</li><li>For our family members, Jeff and Renee, Dylan and Stella and Jon and Jeannette, Freeman and Jade, and the opportunity to watch you adapt, grow, and thrive during COVID-19.</li><li>For our many abiding friends who have been so faithfully in our lives, either via Zoom or socially distanced gatherings.</li><li>For all those we lost to COVID-19 and the joy they brought to our lives, and all those who recovered and returned to full health.</li><li>For everyone on the frontlines of hospitals, grocery stores, delivery trucks, stores, factories and farms who risked their lives to enable ours.</li><li>For the corporate leaders, health care leaders and educational leaders who transformed their organizations overnight to keep serving their employees, customers, and students, especially the medical scientists who created life-saving vaccines.</li><li>For companies like Zoom that enabled us to connect safely with colleagues, teachers and friends in order to continue our work.</li><li>For those who have suffered from discrimination, and yet have risen above it to help others.</li><li>For the 156 million Americans who voted in this fall’s election, teaching us once again that every vote counts and every citizen has the right to vote.</li><li>Finally, for everyone who worked on this year’s election to preserve American democracy for future generations, making this the most secure and fraud-free in our history and putting the Constitution ahead of their political interests.</li><div></div>"

      "<p>COVID-19 continues to wreak havoc, as the disease has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/tag/coronavirus/\">infected more than 8.6 million Americans</a>, 225,000 of whom have died. It has also elevated a set of real heroes: the frontline workers who risk their lives every day to make our lives possible.</p><a href=\"https://fortune.com/tag/coronavirus/\">infected more than 8.6 million Americans</a><p>These heroes include medical workers such as doctors, nurses, and medical technicians, as well as schoolteachers, checkout clerks, bus drivers, shelf stockers, pharmacy employees, restaurant workers, and trash collectors who are in direct contact with the public. Unlike office workers, computer programmers, and analysts, they don’t have the option of working from home via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/zoom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zoom</a>. As a result, frontline workers are much more likely to contract the virus than white-collar workers. In addition to disproportionately bearing health risks, they have also faced greater economic impact, as frontline workers are more vulnerable to unemployment caused by COVID-19.</p><a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/zoom/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Zoom</a><p>Five million fewer Americans have jobs than they did&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-employment.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">four years ago</a>, with more layoffs in process. Last spring’s financial stimulus deferred many layoffs with financial incentives, but many employers now face the reality that consumer demand will be slow to return, forcing them to address reduced revenues, lost profits and even financial solvency.</p><a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/employment-situation/civilian-employment.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">four years ago</a><p>In 1944 Congress passed the G.I. Bill, which provided returning World War II veterans with education, financial assistance and health care. To overcome the consequences of COVID-19, America needs a similarly bold initiative to help frontline employees.</p><p>Here are five proposals to support these workers and value them the way they deserve to be valued.</p><h2>Reskill the workforce</h2><p>As technology accelerates the transformation of many job functions, the skills required for frontline workers are changing dramatically. Without new skills, they risk becoming obsolete and being laid off and replaced by skilled younger workers. To avoid this unattractive outcome, companies, government organizations, educational institutions, and philanthropic organizations need to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/10/26/employee-training-digital-transformation-employers-collaboration-workforce/\">join forces to reskill American workers</a>, focusing on digital and computer capabilities. As they gain greater skills, workers can create more value, securing greater salaries and advancement on more lucrative career paths.</p><a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/10/26/employee-training-digital-transformation-employers-collaboration-workforce/\">join forces to reskill American workers</a><h2>Create new jobs</h2><p>Instead of cash payments, the next government stimulus should focus on creating new jobs through an infrastructure bill and incentives for conversion to renewable energy. It is well known that America’s infrastructure is crumbling and not competitive globally, but past administrations have failed to deliver on their promises. Now is the perfect time for a multiyear infrastructure program. In addition, the best way to accelerate the change to renewable energy is by placing a tax on carbon emissions while incentivizing renewable sources. These changes will create millions of new jobs for frontline workers and address the climate crisis.</p><h2>Institute living wages</h2><p>Can anyone live on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/10/26/chobani-minimum-wage/\">$7.25 per hour, or $15,000 per year</a>? No wonder so many minimum-wage workers hold two or three jobs or engage in the gig economy as Uber drivers. Many of these jobs do not offer health care benefits, leaving millions who cannot afford health insurance. Since Congress last raised the minimum wage, cumulative inflation has reduced its buying power by 20%.</p><a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/10/26/chobani-minimum-wage/\">$7.25 per hour, or $15,000 per year</a><p>Increasing the minimum wage to $15 per hour, as many municipalities and companies like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/02/tech/amazon-minimum-wage/index.html#:~:text=New%20York%20(CNN%20Business)%20Amazon,employees%2C%20plus%20100%2C000%20seasonal%20workers.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon and Costco</a>&nbsp;have done, will begin to address America’s growing income inequality. Small-business owners will complain these increases could put them out of business just as they are trying to recover. Yet if every company must pay the same, those companies will still be on par competitively.</p><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/02/tech/amazon-minimum-wage/index.html#:~:text=New%20York%20(CNN%20Business)%20Amazon,employees%2C%20plus%20100%2C000%20seasonal%20workers.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Amazon and Costco</a><h2>Reconceptualize organizations and culture</h2><p>Why do organization charts show executives on top and frontline workers on the bottom? After all, frontline employees are directly serving customers, the most important constituency. The issue here goes deeper than the orientation of organization charts. Many corporate staff people and middle managers mistakenly believe their job is to&nbsp;<em>control</em>&nbsp;frontline people through rules and numbers. If we flip the organization on its head, their roles become&nbsp;<em>supporting</em>&nbsp;the front line, making it easier for them to do their jobs with sound numbers, information systems, and training. As a practical step, CEOs and their executive teams should spend at least two days per quarter doing frontline tasks side by side with workers, gaining empathy and insight into how they work.</p><em>control</em><em>supporting</em><h2>Remove layers from organizations</h2><p>Today’s large corporations have far too many layers between the CEO and frontline workers, which isolates executives from the marketplace and their employees. A recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/07/the-leaders-calendar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harvard Business School study</a>&nbsp;showed that CEOs spend only 3% of their time with customers. Rather than being in the marketplace and hearing directly from customers, many executives spend time in meetings listening to middle managers interpret what is going on in the marketplace from data analysis. They create bureaucracy with complex approval systems that remove authority from the front line, in favor of inflexible rules-based systems that are not customer-friendly. Instead, they should put decision-making at the point of impact, enabling people with the greatest customer contact to make decisions in real time.</p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2018/07/the-leaders-calendar\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Harvard Business School study</a><p>The economic crisis caused by COVID-19 provides the opportunity for organizations to rethink the role of their frontline workers and the organization structure on top of them. Companies should use this moment to invest in their frontline workers and restructure their organizations to empower them. Increasing compensation, training, and benefits has real upside: It will improve customer satisfaction, reduce costly turnover, provide long-term career tracks for the most valuable employees, reduce income inequality, and make decision-making more streamlined and flexible to respond to changing customer needs.</p><p>The time to act is now.</p><p><em>Bill George is senior fellow at Harvard Business School and former chair and CEO of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/medtronic/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medtronic</a>.

      "<p><strong><em>A Vote for Unity and Stability over Continuing Divisiveness and Chaos</em></strong></p><strong><em>A Vote for Unity and Stability over Continuing Divisiveness and Chaos</em></strong><em>A Vote for Unity and Stability over Continuing Divisiveness and Chaos</em><p>On September 23 Penny and I voted in person at an early voting place in Minneapolis. I cast my vote for President for Joe Biden. Here is why I made that choice:</p><p>In the world’s most powerful leadership position, America needs a leader who will bring us together as a nation, in spite of our many differences. We also need a global leader who will reestablish America’s leadership of the community of nations so essential to address today’s global issues of security, health, income inequality, climate change and many others. As he has demonstrated throughout his 47 years of public service, Joe Biden is that leader.</p><p>Former Vice President Biden is a man with integrity, compassion, and courage who has worked throughout his career for the betterment of all Americans and for America’s leadership of the global community. Over his nearly five decades of public service as America’s views of important issues have continued to evolve, Biden has demonstrated his pragmatism is evolving his own views about race, health, sexual identity, and public safety, but he has never deviated from his values, which are deeply rooted in his faith as a devout Catholic. I feel confident that as President, he will govern as he has led his life, always striving to help all Americans have better, more fulfilling lives and to bring us together as one nation to address the serious issues we face now and in the future.</p><p>As an independent who is a fiscal conservative and social progressive, I believe Biden has a sound economic plan for America to recover from the ravages of COVID-19, with 3.9 million more people unemployed than at the start of President Trump’s term. He plans to expand jobs with a large infrastructure program, increase jobs and research into renewable energy, and broaden health care coverage under the Affordable Care Act, ensuring that everyone with pre-existing conditions can continue to receive coverage. To reduce income inequality, he is proposing to increase the minimum wage to $15.00 as many large employers like Amazon already have and to increase taxes on the wealthy; however, no one making less than $400,000 will see their taxes increased.</p><p>In the past 3½ years under President Trump’s leadership, America has seen continuing chaos and increased divisiveness. The rift between people’s political views, racial identity, gender, and values has grown ever greater to the point we are at risk of losing the essential values that have made America the greatest nation on earth for more than 200 years. President Trump has moved us far away from our founding motto, <em>E Pluribus Unum</em> or “Out of Many, One” that brought and kept us together through the Civil War, two World Wars, the Great Depression, and ongoing crises of leadership and values. The President’s actions throughout his Presidency have been to favor himself, his family and his supporters over the greater needs of the nation. He has used social media and his rhetoric to further split us apart over social issues.</p><em>E Pluribus Unum</em><p>In 2020 America is facing the greatest health crisis of the past 100 years, yet the President has failed to lead us through it, abdicating federal leadership while ignoring the advice of the nation’s leading health experts and scientists, indirectly leading to the deaths of many Americans that could have been avoided. In the wake of the racial concerns following the murder of George Floyd, he has used that event to sow greater racial divisiveness. And in the severe recession that resulted from the COVID-19, he failed to take the steps necessary to control the virus and safely reopen America’s economy, ignoring the reality that these crises are inextricably intertwined and their burdens fall much more heavily on lower social-economic groups.</p><p>If President Trump continues in office until 2025, I fear that we will lose many of the basic tenets of our democracy, as he strives for a unitary Presidency that dominates the other two “separate but equal” branches of government to give himself more power. In recent months he has further undermined our democracy by challenging the integrity of our voting system and his commitment to abide by the results of the Presidential election. If he continues as President, we will also slip further from global leadership and weaken America’s ability to respond to global crises in conjunction with other nations that enabled us to lead the world since World War II.</p><p>If Joe Biden becomes president, these severe crises will certainly not go away, as their long-term impacts are only now beginning to be understood. The wounds of the past 3½ years are so deep that it will take that long or longer to restore America domestically and internationally. But Biden has the temperament to consult with and utilize the best experts to resolve them while bringing us back together as one nation, while striving to work with other nations to seek out global solutions.</p><p>For all of these reasons, I voted for Joe Biden and encourage you to do so as well.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>The race for a COVID-19 vaccine is getting more and more confusing. On Wednesday, September 16, CDC Director Robert Redfield testified in front of Congress that it would be late 2<sup>nd</sup> quarter or early 3<sup>rd</sup> quarter 2021 before a vaccine would be generally available. Hours later President Trump contradicted his CDC director, calling him “confused” and predicting we will have a vaccine as early as next week and in mass distribution shortly thereafter (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/2FGSJ70\">https://bit.ly/2FGSJ70</a>).</p><sup>nd</sup><sup>rd</sup><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2FGSJ70\">https://bit.ly/2FGSJ70</a><p>With COVID-19 still raging in the U.S. and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">the death toll</a>&nbsp;approaching 200,000 Americans and 1 million people worldwide, a safe and effective vaccine is required to stop the spread of the disease and restart the economy.</p><a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\">the death toll</a><p>All eyes are on the pharmaceutical industry, as leading companies have moved ahead to discover, test, and manufacture a vaccine faster than ever before. Many of the world’s best scientists are focused on this goal. To accelerate the availability of a vaccine in record time, the Trump administration launched Operation Warp Speed, funding multiple vaccine candidates through an accelerated development process and committing to purchase hundreds of millions of doses of approved vaccines.</p><p>Trying to speed up science carries many risks, especially for a novel virus like this one, which is not well understood nor easily characterized. Scientific discoveries cannot be driven by timetables like the upcoming Presidential<strong>&nbsp;</strong>election.</p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><p>To address these risks, the following questions must be answered:</p><ol>\n<li>Will there be safety issues not revealed in early clinical trials?</li>\n<li>Will the vaccines be sufficiently effective to stop COVID-19’s spread?</li>\n<li>Will the American people have enough confidence to get vaccinated?</li>\n<li>Will there be sufficient quantities of vaccines available, and who gets priority?</li>\n<li>If multiple vaccines are approved, how will people know which one to get?</li>\n<li>Will political pressure influence the approval process?</li>\n</ol><li>Will there be safety issues not revealed in early clinical trials?</li><li>Will the vaccines be sufficiently effective to stop COVID-19’s spread?</li><li>Will the American people have enough confidence to get vaccinated?</li><li>Will there be sufficient quantities of vaccines available, and who gets priority?</li><li>If multiple vaccines are approved, how will people know which one to get?</li><li>Will political pressure influence the approval process?</li><h2>Safety</h2><p>Time pressure to complete the trials raises concerns that safety issues may appear only after millions of people have been vaccinated. Moncef Slaoui, head of Operation Warp Speed’s vaccine development arm, has said there is a “<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/the-state-of-the-fight-against-covid-19\">very, very low chance</a>” of a vaccine being approved by election day, and that he will resign if he feels pressure to approve an unsafe vaccine.</p><a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/science/medical-dispatch/the-state-of-the-fight-against-covid-19\">very, very low chance</a><p>On Sept. 9, clinical trials for AstraZeneca’s leading vaccine candidate were halted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/health/covid-astrazeneca-vaccine-trans.html\">after a patient developed neurological symptoms</a>, illustrating the care that must be taken in testing new vaccines. (Those trials have since resumed after a careful clinical review.) Learning of safety issues after millions of healthy people have been vaccinated would be devastating to the nation’s health and public confidence.</p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/10/health/covid-astrazeneca-vaccine-trans.html\">after a patient developed neurological symptoms</a><h2>Effectiveness</h2><p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has set the minimum threshold for a vaccine’s effectiveness at 50%, essentially the same bar as flu vaccines, but influenza has a far lower risk of death than COVID-19 does. With 50% effectiveness, will the public feel sufficiently confident to resume their normal lives—working in crowded spaces, attending concerts or sporting events, going into crowded bars and restaurants, or taking long airplane flights? Hopefully, pharmaceutical makers will be able to develop a vaccine with substantially more than 50% effectiveness.</p><h2>Public confidence</h2><p>A Sept. 10 Kaiser Family Foundation poll found that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/report/kff-health-tracking-poll-september-2020/\">54% of Americans would not want to receive a vaccine approved prior to election day on Nov. 3</a>. Meanwhile, anti-vaccine activists are using COVID-19 to<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01423-4\">&nbsp;stoke fears about the safety of all vaccines</a>. Thus, it is essential to build public confidence in the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness, so more people will volunteer to get vaccinated.</p><a href=\"https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/report/kff-health-tracking-poll-september-2020/\">54% of Americans would not want to receive a vaccine approved prior to election day on Nov. 3</a><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-01423-4\">&nbsp;stoke fears about the safety of all vaccines</a><h2>Availability</h2><p>Once approved, a vaccine is unlikely to be widely available for several months. Health care workers should have priority access. After that, how will priorities be established to determine who gets the vaccine? Priorities should be based on risk stratification, with more immediate access given to vulnerable populations such as the elderly, people with diabetes and obesity, or people in high-risk occupations.</p><h2>Determining which one to get</h2><p>With major pharmaceutical companies spending billions of dollars to create an effective vaccine, several candidates will eventually be approved by the FDA, each with its own scientific approach and level of effectiveness. The first vaccine will get the publicity, but will it be the most effective? Consumers will need sufficient information to decide which vaccine to receive, and they should get that information from their physicians, not pharmaceutical ads on television or word of mouth.</p><h2>Political intervention</h2><p>There are growing concerns about politics entering into FDA decisions, especially if approval or an emergency use authorization (EUA) is granted prior to the Nov. 3 election. The aforementioned Kaiser poll found that 61% of Americans are worried the FDA will rush to approve a vaccine due to political pressure.</p><p>These concerns are heightened by the FDA’s premature EUA of hydroxychloroquine prior to testing last spring, an approval the FDA later withdrew. Additionally, a recent National Institutes of Health panel criticized the FDA for its EUA of convalescent plasma&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/01/nih-panel-refutes-fdas-claims-of-the-benefits-of-coronavirus-plasma-treatment.html\">without having performed randomized tests</a>. For such an important health care decision, political pressure has no place in the vaccine approval process.</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/01/nih-panel-refutes-fdas-claims-of-the-benefits-of-coronavirus-plasma-treatment.html\">without having performed randomized tests</a><h2>A plan to win the public’s confidence</h2><p>The COVID-19 crisis will not end until we have one or more safe, effective, and widely available vaccines.

      "<p>In the midst of the largest COVID-19 spread yet, my family and I are spending a quiet 4<sup>th</sup> of July holiday in Colorado. Instead of taking our four grandkids along with their parents to the July 3<sup>rd</sup> cookout and dinner, followed by the 4<sup>th</sup> of July parade where we wave the American flag and my favorite concert where we listen to and sing patriotic songs, we are having a more reflective holiday – thinking about what it means to be an American.</p><sup>th</sup><sup>rd</sup><sup>th</sup><p>On Friday night we watched the television version of “Hamilton,” an amazing history lesson seen through the life of Alexander Hamilton – a history not often taught in our schools. Like all of our founders, Hamilton was an imperfect person who nevertheless worked tirelessly for his vision of the new country. As the musical makes clear, there were deep divisions among our founders about how that new vision should become reality, but our founders were fully united behind Jefferson’s principle of equality.</p><p>The racial-blind casting brought home the meaning of Thomas Jefferson’s Declaration of Independence that “All men are created equal and endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.” That led to family discussions are how far we are from that ideal today, and just how many people are not being treated equally and not given equal opportunities.</p><p>Today the divisions about the American vision are wider than at any time since the Civil War when millions died to keep the nation united rather than divided in two to preserve slavery of African Americans. As President Abraham Lincoln said then, “A house divided against itself cannot stand.” As the war was ending, it was Lincoln again who said in his second inaugural address, “With malice toward none, with charity for all . . . let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation’s wounds.” Yet Lincoln’s tragic assassination left those wounds exposed, even 155 years later.</p><p>Now America is in the midst of a great reawakening, triggered by the ravages of a rapidly spreading virus, brutal murders of African-Americans by the police charged with protecting them, a fractured economy which has exposed the depths of income inequality in our nation, and a presidential campaign that is forcing us to decide what America truly stands for.</p><p>As we contemplate both our nation’s leaders and our own leadership in this challenging yet decisive time, it is essential that we reexamine the essential role of leaders:</p><ol>\n<li>To align people around our common purpose and unite us as “We the people.”</li>\n<li>To reiterate and practice our shared values of providing all Americans with their rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</li>\n<li>To inspire and empower people to strive for a more just nation that provides abundant opportunities for all Americans.</li>\n<li>To collaborate as neighbors, communities, states and our nation to restore the American dream through creativity and hard work by addressing the challenging problems we face in 2020.</li>\n<li>To measure ourselves not by our net worth or the nation’s GDP, but rather by the extent we meet the American ideals established by our founders.</li>\n</ol><li>To align people around our common purpose and unite us as “We the people.”</li><li>To reiterate and practice our shared values of providing all Americans with their rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</li><li>To inspire and empower people to strive for a more just nation that provides abundant opportunities for all Americans.</li><li>To collaborate as neighbors, communities, states and our nation to restore the American dream through creativity and hard work by addressing the challenging problems we face in 2020.</li><li>To measure ourselves not by our net worth or the nation’s GDP, but rather by the extent we meet the American ideals established by our founders.</li><p>Now ask yourself, as I am asking myself, how well am I practicing these roles in my leadership? Am I true to choosing leaders that are most capable of leading in these ways, while avoiding my partisan preferences?</p><p>There could be no more important time for us to step up to our role as leaders and bring people together around these truly American principles.</p><p>Our nation’s future depends on us.</p><div></div>"

The only way for America to regain control over COVID-19 spread&nbsp;<em>and&nbsp;</em>get its economy restarted is for the Trump administration to take charge. Here are seven actions the administration should take now to accomplish this:</p><em>and&nbsp;</em><p>1.&nbsp;<strong>Strictly enforce</strong>&nbsp;revised guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including mandatory wearing of masks and six-foot social distancing in public spaces, and limiting the size of public gatherings to 50 people or fewer.</p><strong>Strictly enforce</strong><p>2.&nbsp;<strong>Expand free testing</strong>&nbsp;to determine asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19.</p><strong>Expand free testing</strong><p>3.&nbsp;<strong>Establish contact tracing</strong>&nbsp;for all positive cases.</p><strong>Establish contact tracing</strong><p>4.&nbsp;<strong>Create&nbsp;public health</strong>&nbsp;“fast action” teams to fly into hotspots to help stop COVID-19 spread.</p><strong>Create&nbsp;public health</strong><p>5.&nbsp;<strong>Hold regular national briefings&nbsp;</strong>by public health experts—not politicians—to rebuild public confidence.</p><strong>Hold regular national briefings&nbsp;</strong><p>6.&nbsp;<strong>Provide additional federal financial support</strong>&nbsp;to unemployed persons and small businesses.</p><strong>Provide additional federal financial support</strong><p>7.&nbsp;<strong>Stimulate immediate job creation</strong>&nbsp;through a trillion-dollar infrastructure program, similar to the one undertaken in 2009 during the Great Recession.</p><strong>Stimulate immediate job creation</strong><p>To lead this effort, President Trump should appoint an established health care expert, such as former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, as COVID-19 czar, with authority to enforce these science-based orders. During the 2009 financial crisis, the Obama administration appointed Steven Rattner as automobile czar; Rattner quickly restructured the industry, leading to its resurgence.</p><p>The restart of the U.S. economy cannot be separated from control over this deadly virus. This requires immediate action by the Trump administration to stem the virus’s spread. The alternative is not only millions more Americans getting sick, but the current economic crisis spiraling into an extended decline.</p><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/07/02/coronavirus-covid-19-plan-to-restart-economy/\">Fortune.com</a> on 7/2/2020.</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/07/02/coronavirus-covid-19-plan-to-restart-economy/\">Fortune.com</a> on 7/2/2020.</em><a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/07/02/coronavirus-covid-19-plan-to-restart-economy/\">Fortune.com</a><div></div>"

      "<p>America is at a tipping point. We are heading into an era of dramatic change.</p><p>Earlier tipping points were triggered by cataclysmic events: the end of World War II (1945), the assassination of President Kennedy (1963), Osama bin Laden’s assault on New York (2001), and the collapse of the global financial system (2008). The lesson of these earlier events is that we never revert to the prior state in a year or two. Rather, the fallout and changes evolve over many years, usually a decade or more.</p><p>Now in 2020, America is facing the greatest crisis since the Great Depression. Actually, we are facing four crises simultaneously that are inextricably intertwined: the racism exposed by the killing of George Floyd, the ongoing spread of COVID-19, the ensuing economic turmoil, and political disintegration caused by extreme partisan cleavage.</p><p>Floyd’s homicide spawned protests throughout the United States and the world, revealing America’s racial and economic inequities to the entire world. In contrast to other polls showing a splintered nation, Americans were united in support of the protesters: 84% percent felt the protests were justified while only 12% felt they went too far.</p><p>Throughout America, people are asking, “Is this who we really are?” Until we rid America of the scourge of racism and extreme inequality, we must admit that this is who we are.</p><p>Three years ago, Penny and I stood at the Jefferson Memorial with our oldest grandchildren, Dylan and Freeman, on the first night of our grandparents trip to the nation’s capital. As we looked above the towering statue of Thomas Jefferson to the words of the Declaration of Independence, “All men are created equal,” I asked them whether they believed that.</p><p>Now in 2020 the entire nation is questioning whether we believe – and practice – those words.” George Floyd’s killing ripped off the bandage of America’s idealistic façade and revealed the ugly truth that many Americans do not believe we are created equal. Moreover, we are failing to provide those unalienable rights of “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness” to all Americans, especially people of color.</p><p>President Ronald Reagan cited John Winthrop in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYiOUEjzZNs\">calling</a> America “the shining city on the hill.”&nbsp; Today, that shining city is in flames as we closed our doors and became “America First,” which has regressed into America alone.</p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYiOUEjzZNs\">calling</a><p>America has lost sight of its True North, proclaimed in the Declaration of Independence. Income inequality is greater than it has ever been. Disparities between whites and people of color are widening, not shrinking. People of color face racial injustice regularly. The middle class is shrinking and struggling to stay above water. Ill health and diseases like COVID-19 fall much more heavily on people of color. Those on the lower rungs of the social-economic ladder carry the burdens of underpaid jobs, lack of health care benefits, part-time work, and the ranks of the unemployed. For many, the American dream seems far out of reach.</p><p>It is easy to stand to cheer the American flag and sing the nation anthem, but much harder to make the promises of July 4, 1776 become reality throughout the nation. As we approach the nation’s 244<sup>th</sup> anniversary, we are more divided as a nation than we have been at any time since the Civil War. As Abraham Lincoln said, “A house divided against itself cannot stand.”</p><sup>th</sup><p>Lincoln strove to unite Americans amid the turmoil of the Civil War as he summoned Americans to have “malice toward none and charity toward all” and “bind up the nation’s wounds.” Today we have strayed far from his admonition; all too often, we seem to have malice for many and charity only for people in our tribe. After decades of progress in desegregating our society, we have re-segregated our schools, communities, churches and friendships.</p><p>Now is the time for Americans to set aside our differences and cast off our anger, prejudices, and disdain for people who look or believe differently than we do. We are all Americans – white, black, brown, or yellow; native-born or recently immigrated citizens. Yet often we do not treat each other with respect or dignity, especially if their differences make us feel uncomfortable.</p><p>This is not just a national problem that can be solved with a new president. The change must come first from us as individuals – in our hearts and minds – and then by working within our communities and our cities. That is the only way genuine and lasting change takes place.</p><p>First, ask yourself, what can I do? Then ask, what can we do together? At my wife’s suggestion, I made this list of simple and immediate things I can do right now:</p><ol>\n<li>Call my African-American friends to see how they are feeling and understand their point of view. Hear their personal experiences with discrimination.</li>\n<li>Tour the riot torn areas of Minneapolis, led by a local resident, and talk to people about their hopes for rebuilding. Explore how and why the health and economic burdens of COVID-19 have impacted lower social-economic groups more severely.</li>\n<li>Watch documentaries like “The 13<sup>th</sup>” and “Just Mercy” and read books articulating the history and viewpoints of African-Americans like <u>The New Jim Crow</u> and <u>White Fragility</u>.</li>\n<li>Listen to cable television stations, check out websites and read newspapers articulating perspectives different than those you normally consider. For me this includes Fox News, Breitbart, <em>American Conservative </em>and<em> Federalist</em>. For others it might include <em>The New York Times</em>, <em>The Atlantic</em>, or <em>The New Yorker</em>.</li>\n<li>Engage in dialogues on social media with thoughtful people whose viewpoints are different in order to understand their perspectives.</li>\n<li>Listen to what our neighbors are saying and feeling. Explore what we can do together, such as creating a neighborhood block party or joining National Night Out.</li>\n</ol><li>Call my African-American friends to see how they are feeling and understand their point of view.

    "post_date": "June 1, 2020",
    "post_content": [
      "<p>As I sit in my home, just a few blocks from stores that are closed indefinitely, I feel sadness, pain and outrage at what has happened to our city in the last few days.</p><p>Penny and I came here fifty years ago. After changing companies twice, living overseas in two countries, and teaching at Harvard Business School the past sixteen years, we are still here because we love and are proud of Minneapolis. We have worked together throughout these years with business, health care and community leaders to make Minneapolis the most attractive place for people of all races to live.</p><p>The senseless killing of George Floyd has shattered our dream of Minneapolis as a progressive city on the rise. The video of police veteran Derek Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s throat is almost too painful to watch, as Chavin impassively suffocated him as he pleaded for his life. Meanwhile, two fellow officers assist Chauvin, holding down his legs and torso while a third surveys the bystanders pleading with the police officers to stop. Floyd’s alleged crime? He reportedly used a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes.</p><p>If ever we needed a living example of “man’s inhumanity to man,” it is Chauvin with his hands in his pockets never easing up the pressure even after Floyd loses consciousness. It was later reported that Chauvin has had 18 complaints filed against him, three of them for excessive use of force. Yet he has been allowed to stay in the police force – until he was fired after Floyd’s death.</p><p>The Minneapolis police department is notorious for the death of African Americans suspected of crimes. Although the force is predominately white, the only officer convicted of a crime in its entire history was Mohamed Noor, the Somali immigrant officer who shot Justine Ruszczyk, a white woman who had called the police. The policemen who caused the deaths of Philando Castile and Jamar Clark were found not guilty, nor is there is any assurance Chavin will be found guilty, as proving criminal guilt of an on-duty police officer is extremely difficult. On Sunday evening Minnesota Governor Tim Walz asked the Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison to lead the prosecution for Chavin’s case.</p><p>This past week the world watched as Minneapolitans reacted. The vast majority of protesters were young people of all races protesting peacefully, most of them wearing masks to protect against COVID-19. However, extremists bent on creating civil unrest, many of them from out of state, burned and looted stores and businesses. The stores less than a mile from our home had their windows broken, goods stolen and significant damage done. As we drove down Hennepin Avenue through our Uptown neighborhood on Sunday, all the stores were boarded up with hastily assembled plywood walls.</p><p>The Minneapolis police attempted to control the crowd and stop the violence with non-lethal methods, but they were overwhelmed by the sheer number of protesters. On Saturday Governor Walz called in the Minnesota National Guard to take control as the sun was setting. Given that a curfew had been in effect since 8:00 pm, the National Guard was quickly able to establish control. A similar tactic on Sunday brought the protests under control, with curfew violators arrested.</p><p>On Sunday afternoon, Penny and I were among the protesters on the Hennepin Avenue bridge. Most knelt as singers sang gospel hymns. When the movement began, they began chanting, “George Floyd,” “Black Lives Matter,” and Floyd’s last words, “I can’t breathe.” The thousands of people we saw were peaceful and serious, with many carrying signs to honor Floyd.</p><p>Over the weekend the community has been responding to help those people and businesses harmed by the violence. Hundreds engaged in clean-up efforts. When a school near the 5<sup>th</sup> district police station asked for food for students and families, citizens dropped off several thousand bags. A fund to rebuild Lake Street stores received over $1 million in contributions in less than a day.</p><sup>th</sup><p><strong>Reflections</strong></p><strong>Reflections</strong><p>While it is difficult to fully comprehend what is happening, here are my reflections at this early stage.</p><p>The killing of George Floyd set off a powder keg of pent-up frustrations and despair at the pervasive of the inequities and racism soiling our city and country. Many people are saying, “Enough is enough.”</p><p>I believe we must address the deep inequities, racial injustice, and prejudice that people of color have encountered for years. Changing the culture of the Minneapolis police force is only an essential first step. The police must reclaim their sworn obligation to protect and serve. Beyond that, business and community leaders must provide equal opportunities for people of color to progress through their leadership ranks, until the diversity of their leaders reflects the diversity of the people they serve. Elected officials at the state and local level must ensure equal justice under the law for everyone.</p><p>While these steps are imperative, none of them will impact what is in people’s hearts. As long as people judge others based on the color of their skin instead of the content of their character – to quote Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. – we will have work to do.&nbsp; We need moral leaders who call upon “the better angels of our nature” to guide us on this journey.</p><p>Moral leaders call upon clarity of purpose and consistent practice of their values. They inspire and empower us to step up and lead authentically. They summon us to do the right things for the right reasons in building a just society where everyone is treated with fairness and justice and has equal opportunity to achieve and live the full life they deserve.</p><p>My greatest desire is for people to step up as moral leaders, each in their own way, to restore greatness to our city and our nation by building a just and moral society.</p><div></div>"

Many states are already beginning to reopen and this must happen in the safest way possible.</em><p>Americans want our country to open up safely.</p><p>We have been at this for a number of difficult weeks since the global coronavirus pandemic began, and it has taken a toll.</p><p>It has been a time of unprecedented challenge. To our health. To our jobs. To our social connections. To our health care communities.</p><p>We have sacrificed with great unity to #StayHome in order to reduce the infection rate and save lives.</p><p>We want a sense of normalcy&nbsp;back — to go to work, to go to restaurants, to see sports again, to send our kids to school, to hug our families — but not at the expense of the lives of our friends, families and neighbors.</p><p>We want a good economy and public safety, but we are afraid if we open too quickly, or don’t have plans to adjust if spread recurs, we will have neither.</p><p>We don’t believe we need to wait until everything is completely perfect or there is zero risk before we open again. The reality is that many states are already taking the first steps toward&nbsp;opening, and this must happen in the safest way possible.</p><p>Americans should still #StayHome whenever possible and continue social distancing. Now we need to get on a path to #OpenSafely that gets it right.</p><h2>Still growing, contagious and lethal</h2><p><a class=\"gnt_ar_b_a\" href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">COVID-19 is still spreading</a>, but at a steadier rate. While it is shrinking in places like New York, it is still growing rapidly in some areas where there had been fewer cases. The virus is still equally contagious. The virus is still lethal to many. The virus still spreads through unsuspecting asymptomatic people. Some places are especially hard hit: nursing homes, meatpacking plants, prisons, detention centers, public housing, and the communities around them as people move in and out. People are still dying at an alarming rate, and that will continue unless we follow the path like the one outlined by Dr. Deborah Birx at the White House:&nbsp;<a class=\"gnt_ar_b_a\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">a steady, gated reopening</a>&nbsp;that avoids accelerated growth in cases, hospitalizations&nbsp;and deaths.</p><a href=\"https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">COVID-19 is still spreading</a><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">a steady, gated reopening</a><p>Tens of millions of Americans are now out of work. Many businesses have closed;&nbsp;others are in danger. Americans are facing hunger and the inability to pay their rent or mortgage at levels not seen here since the Great Depression. Congress and the administration have passed laws to support Americans through this, but support isn’t the same thing as a job. And the support still leaves voids that need to be filled.</p><p>Yet opening the country before we have the conditions like those outlined in the White House plan can put Americans at risk unless we take further steps.&nbsp;It won’t help the economy if we end up having to pull back hard or close again because the virus starts spreading toward the point where it threatens our health care systems and further disrupts our health. The things that will bring us back&nbsp;— consumer spending, business hiring, signing leases, travel&nbsp;and capital investment&nbsp;— won’t happen unless Americans feel confident they can do these things without a substantial risk of harm to themselves or their loved ones from getting and spreading COVID-19.</p><p>We are asking decision-makers at all levels to #OpenSafely — to move along the path of opening up our communities again as deliberately as necessary and as quickly as can be safely accomplished.</p><p>Opening up safely means:</p><p>►Following the&nbsp;<a class=\"gnt_ar_b_a\" href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">plan laid out by Dr.&nbsp;Birx</a>&nbsp;to begin opening communities up with two weeks of declining case counts and the other gating criteria met — or explaining how there is an alternative plan for containment if that condition is not met.</p><a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/openingamerica/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">plan laid out by Dr.&nbsp;Birx</a><p>►Creating adequate diagnostic testing availability so that people who need a test can get one — particularly people with symptoms, and those without symptoms in high-risk settings like nursing homes, prisons&nbsp;and meatpacking plants.</p><p>►Implementing&nbsp;<a class=\"gnt_ar_b_a\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/reopen-guidance.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">improved safety standards</a>&nbsp;and protocols to avoid outbreaks and slow spreading in potential hot spots.</p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/reopen-guidance.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">improved safety standards</a><p>►Having adequate public health infrastructure to&nbsp;<a class=\"gnt_ar_b_a\" href=\"https://contacttracingplaybook.resolvetosavelives.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">contact trace</a>&nbsp;and offer voluntary isolation to contain the virus when it is detected —&nbsp;not necessarily to trace all cases successfully, but enough to minimize potential outbreak clusters and keep getting better over time.</p><a href=\"https://contacttracingplaybook.resolvetosavelives.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">contact trace</a><p>►Protecting vulnerable and at-risk populations and hard-hit communities, and not putting essential workers at needless risk.</p><p>►Obtaining&nbsp;<a class=\"gnt_ar_b_a\" href=\"https://www.projectn95.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">sufficient&nbsp;</a>personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect our first responders and health care workforce, including by expanding access to testing in the community</p><a href=\"https://www.projectn95.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">sufficient&nbsp;</a><h2>Pause if care capacity is threatened</h2><p>As the reopening process begins and moves forward, states should be carefully monitoring hospitalization trends and their hospital capacity.

The lag between infection and serious complications is typically eight days or more, so there is little time to wait if such trends emerge.</p><p>Additional important areas to make progress on that will reduce risk of transmission and support continued opening up:</p><p>►Widespread use of&nbsp;<a class=\"gnt_ar_b_a\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">high-quality masks</a>.</p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/prevent-getting-sick/diy-cloth-face-coverings.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">high-quality masks</a><p>►Surge capacity in the health care system with sufficient PPE&nbsp;to protect health care workers.</p><p>►Evidence-based mitigation measures and screenings in offices and public spaces, using&nbsp;<a class=\"gnt_ar_b_a\" href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/php/CDC-Activities-Initiatives-for-COVID-19-Response.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control</a>&nbsp;and Prevention, or comparable ones.</p><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/php/CDC-Activities-Initiatives-for-COVID-19-Response.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control</a><p>►Controls at major air and rail entry points.</p><p>►Continuous monitoring at the state and county level for indications of potential emerging outbreaks, including symptom-checking apps, digital thermometers&nbsp;and other syndromic surveillance tools as they become available.</p><p>►Test, trace&nbsp;and isolate most active cases and their closest contacts, using vacant hotel space where necessary.</p><p>►Coordinated response with neighboring states.</p><p>►Widespread use of telemedicine to improve health care access and reduce the use of PPE.</p><p>►Readiness to respond quickly to new community spread.</p><h2>Safest to carefully open up</h2><p>Areas that can most safely open up (with appropriate distancing and risk mitigation steps) if states have met the Dr. Birx gating criteria but have not yet initiated the reopening process are:</p><p>►Doctor offices, clinics and surgery centers with sufficient community PPE.</p><p>►Workplaces like retail and manufacturing.</p><p>►Parks and other outdoor recreation, lakes, gardens&nbsp;and bike trails.</p><p>►Shopping areas and coffee shops where people don’t congregate in large numbers or for extended periods.</p><p>►Outdoor weddings and funerals with small groups that physically distance and wear masks when close together.</p><p>Additional areas that we hope can open up successfully under significantly modified conditions, but that will benefit from further technical assessment on how processes should be modified that would allow them to operate with lower risks:</p><p>►Day care centers</p><p>►Summer camps and youth sports</p><p>►Restaurants</p><p>►Schools</p><p>►Movie theaters and small entertainment venues</p><p>►Sporting events with very limited or no crowds</p><p>►TV and film production</p><p>►Colleges and universities</p><p>►Bars</p><p>Areas that should remain closed until risks can be significantly reduced:</p><p>►Large-scale events like concerts, sports with high attendance</p><p>►Large conventions and other activities involving significant travel and congregation</p><p>We believe these lists can be&nbsp;<a class=\"gnt_ar_b_a\" href=\"https://www.covidexitstrategy.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">refined and adjusted locally</a>&nbsp;based on conditions, proximity to hot spots, density&nbsp;and other factors.</p><a href=\"https://www.covidexitstrategy.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-t-l=\"|inline|intext|n/a\">refined and adjusted locally</a><p>We are asking public officials and decision-makers to #OpenSafely by quickly getting the conditions in place so we can move forward.

      "<p>If there is any positive consequence resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, it’s the acceleration of the shift to stakeholder capitalism away from its singular emphasis on shareholders.</p><p>Ever since Noble Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman <a href=\"http://umich.edu/~thecore/doc/Friedman.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">declared</a> in 1970 that the social responsibility of business is to increase its profits, a debate has raged between advocates of shareholder primacy and stakeholder capitalism.

Asked about their greatest risks, 97% cited employee safety, 73% noted the impact on their customers, 64% worried about demand returning, 38% were concerned about adequate safety nets for employees and 38% worried about disruption to supply chains. Notably missing from this list are near-term earnings and stock prices.</p><a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/05/14/fortune-500-ceo-survey-coronavirus-pandemic-predictions/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">Fortune survey</a><p>To thrive competitively and financially in 2021 and beyond, CEOs are adopting creative strategies with new business models to meet their customers’ rapidly changing needs, as the COVID-19 crisis enables them to accelerate three years of changes into the next three months. Nowhere is this more apparent than in digital transformation as the primary way companies engage with customers and operate their businesses. Those on the leading edge of digital like Amazon, Walmart, and Microsoft are thriving while companies that lagged like J.C. Penney, Sears, and AMC Theaters struggle to survive.</p><p>Here’s how the COVID-19 pandemic is impacting each stakeholder group:</p><p><strong>Employees. </strong>The coronavirus crisis has reinforced the importance of employees working on the front lines of health care, retail, food and medical equipment and delivery services, many of whom are risking their lives to serve others. Employee safety has become paramount and the gating factor to reopening their workplaces. Walmart’s McMillon recognized the importance of front-line workers in combatting COVID-19 when he announced $550 million in bonuses on March 19 for full-time and part-time hourly employees. Shortly thereafter, Target CEO Brian Cornell provided $300 million in special payments to its workers. Many employers have settled on a minimum of $15.00/hour, <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/02/tech/amazon-minimum-wage/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">as Amazon did</a> for its 575,000 employees, while providing health care, sick leave and retirement.</p><strong>Employees. </strong><a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/02/tech/amazon-minimum-wage/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">as Amazon did</a><p>As companies restart, they will be restructuring their organizations to reduce middle managers, travel budgets, and consultants, while simultaneously upgrading training, compensation, and benefits for front-line employees. As routine jobs are automated, there will be fewer but better trained workers. Meanwhile, many employees working from home are finding they can be more productive working on their own schedules and avoiding long commutes. The CEO of one Indian software company noted productivity had gone up without commuting time and said that his company would shift to using shared office space. Another executive proposed the office would become “a collaboration hub” to explore new ideas and work on collaborative projects.</p><p><strong>Customers.</strong> When companies reopen, will they be greeted by customers ready to purchase their products and services? The devastating impact of unemployment, furloughs and pay cuts has reinforced the need for savings and cash reserves and reducing discretionary spending. Instead of buying new homes and automobiles, many consumers are opting to keep their vehicles longer and live in rental apartments. Health and safety concerns further accelerate the shift to shopping online, at store pickup, and home delivery of everything from groceries to personal computers. By the time a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, these new habits will become routine consumer behavior, unlikely to revert. Companies that meet these new demands in an efficient, safe manner will be the winners. Service concepts will change as well, with service delivered remotely using electronic tools and teleservice. CEO Corie Barry has reengineered Best Buy’s online and its in-store experience with private appointments and remote service.</p><strong>Customers.</strong><p><strong>Suppliers. </strong>Supply chain shortages of critical parts during the pandemic have hampered manufacturing of critical products like masks and pharmaceuticals, as long supply lines to India and China proved difficult. These problems will cause companies to rebalance supply chains in multiple geographies, even at higher costs, and establish preferred supplier agreements rather than choosing only the lowest cost suppliers.</p><strong>Suppliers. </strong><p><strong>Communities. </strong>The COVID-19 pandemic has restored the importance of one’s local community, but also has stripped employees of in-person communities at work, leading to creating communities online, including virtual social gatherings. Many companies are taking on community service projects to help those harmed by COVID-19. Target is donating N95 respirator masks to medical centers short of vitally needed supplies and providing a SAFE Retail Toolkit to help retailers reopen safely.</p><strong>Communities. </strong><p><strong>Shareholders. </strong>Companies that adapt rapidly to the “new normal” economy will be the winners in the marketplace, enabling them to create greater value for investors. Paradoxically, the greatest shareholder value creators are not those that obsess over maximizing shareholder value. Rather, they are companies like Microsoft, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Amazon, Walmart, Apple, Medtronic and Google that focus on long-term strategies to create superior value for their customers with highly motivated, well-compensated employees.</p><strong>Shareholders. </strong><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has caused CEOs to recognize that stakeholder capitalism is the only way to create sustainable shareholder value, adapting their business models to meet customers’ emerging needs, inspire employees, partner with suppliers, and build communities.</p><p><em>Bill George is senior fellow at Harvard Business School, former chair and CEO of Medtronic and author of </em><u>Discover Your True North.</u></p><em>Bill George is senior fellow at Harvard Business School, former chair and CEO of Medtronic and author of </em><u>Discover Your True North.</u><div></div>"

As routine jobs are automated, there will be fewer but better trained workers. Meanwhile, many employees working from home are finding they can be more productive working on their own schedules and avoiding long commutes.</p><h3><strong>Customers</strong></h3><strong>Customers</strong><p data-inc=\"2\">When companies reopen, will they be greeted by customers ready to purchase their products and services? The devastating impact of unemployment, furloughs, and pay cuts has reinforced the need for savings, cash reserves, and reduced discretionary spending. Instead of buying new homes and automobiles, many consumers are opting to keep their vehicles longer and live in rental apartments. Health and safety concerns further accelerate the shift to shopping online, at store pickup, and home delivery of everything from groceries to personal computers.</p><p>By the time a COVID-19 vaccine is widely available, these new habits will become routine consumer behavior—and unlikely to revert. Companies that meet these new demands in an efficient, safe manner will be the winners. Service concepts will change as well, with service delivered remotely using electronic tools and teleservice.

These problems will cause companies to rebalance supply chains in multiple geographies, even at higher costs, and establish preferred supplier agreements rather than choosing only the lowest cost suppliers.</p><h3><strong>Communities</strong></h3><strong>Communities</strong><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has restored the importance of one’s local community, but also has stripped employees of in-person communities at work. In response, many companies are engaging employees through online activities, such as virtual happy hours. Other forms of community have also come to the forefront.

      "<p>In wartime, Americans have celebrated our military warriors and veterans who have risked their lives to preserve our freedom. As the ravages of Coronavirus spread, today’s heroes are the front-line health care workers – the doctors, nurses, orderlies, technicians – who risk their lives every day to save ours.</p><p>Yesterday I spoke with <strong>Dr. Saquib Rahim</strong>, one of my former students at Harvard Business School. He had his first day off after <strong>36 consecutive days of 12-14 hours working on the COVID-19 ward</strong> at New York Presbyterian Hospital in the global epicenter of the virus. When I asked him about the experience, he said, “I am exhausted,”</p><strong>Dr. Saquib Rahim</strong><strong>36 consecutive days of 12-14 hours working on the COVID-19 ward</strong><blockquote><p><em>The patients are coming so fast there is no time to process. I am stunned by what I see with Coronavirus patients; it’s so different than anything I have seen in 15 years of patient care. We are perpetually surprised. We still have no sense of which patients will get better and which won’t make it. Some patients seem to be getting better and then decline rapidly and have to be intubated. We don’t have any real therapies; we tried hydroxychloroquine but it had minimal impact, so we stopped using it. We are worried about a second wave, because this disease is so transmissible; we’ve never seen anything like it before. We are doing everything in our power to restore their health. </em></p></blockquote><p><em>The patients are coming so fast there is no time to process.

I got to know him as a student in my course, Authentic Leader Development, where he would come to my office talk about his career. Thirteen years later he has been Chief Medical Officer and VP, Digital Strategy for Aetna Health and later in a leadership role at Merck, but he has continued as a practicing physician at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Queens, NY. In May he will join Johnson &amp; Johnson, while continuing his active medical practice.</p><p>In spite of his long, exhausting days, he has found time to post regular messages on LinkedIn, which are some of the most moving I have ever read. Reading his posts is one way to get in touch with the tragedy happening around us every day. Here are a few excerpts (quoted with his permission):</p><p><em>#1: Today I have 12 confirmed Covid-19 patients on my service alone, with the number climbing every day. Please keep those patients in your prayers… Yesterday afternoon I had to tell an elderly Hispanic woman she tested positive for coronavirus… She looked at me really sad: “Does this mean I’m going to die now?”… My heart broke into so many pieces to see her that scared. Take care of each other y’all… Social distancing does not mean social isolation… Be extra kind.</em></p><em>#1: Today I have 12 confirmed Covid-19 patients on my service alone, with the number climbing every day.

As you can see from his poignant posts, his work is heartbreaking. His posts are filled with emotion, compassion and wisdom enabling us to feel we are there with him.

Now in this crisis, we are recognizing that the true American heroes are the health care workers on the front lines of combatting Coronavirus – risking their lives to save ours. In this hour we should honor and reward them, and remember Dr. Rahim’s words, “It’s never too late to start living and leading from a place of compassion and authenticity.”</p><p><em>(You can find Dr. Rahim’s complete posts on his LinkedIn site.) </em></p><em>(You can find Dr. Rahim’s complete posts on his LinkedIn site.) </em><div></div>"

      "<p>Each day we are learning ways to adapt to the new “Working from Home” reality as we self-isolate in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As people speculate on how long this shutdown will last and when will we return to our normal lives at work, the reality is that this may never happen.</p><p>Once the COVID-19 pandemic passes, we won’t go back to business as usual. Here are some ways this crisis will permanently change our lives and our work:</p><p><strong>Work from Home on demand.&nbsp;</strong>COVID-19 has shown people how they can get their work done from their homes and use videoconferencing to communicate with their colleagues. When the pandemic is under control, it is unlikely they will go back to working as before. Far fewer people will have their own office or private workspace. Almost all their work will be done on-line, so there will be no need to keep paper files in office files. Instead, many more will work from home or a shared office in which they use shared desks and workspaces, with enclosed conference rooms for meetings. Most people are finding they do not need the same level of administrative support as they schedule meetings through easy-to-use calendaring and video conferencing systems. Already, enormous firms like Accenture have moved to this form of working for its 500,000 employees.</p><strong>Work from Home on demand.&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Online, all the time.&nbsp;</strong>The workday will change from 9 to 5 to 24/7, as people will be connected through their devices all the time. As one manager told me, “My company would take 100% of my time if I let it.” That means people must set their own boundaries between home and work – apportioning family time, personal time, leisure time, and sleeping hours. If they don’t, work life will become unbearable and the quality of their work will decline. To accomplish this, all employees – with the possible exception of factory and warehouse workers – will need to be fully wired with mobile phones, laptops, printers and a full range of accessory devices.</p><strong>Online, all the time.&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Shift to online shopping.&nbsp;</strong>While not a new trend, COVID-19 has accelerated the shift to online shopping and away from shopping malls and big box stores. The initial impetus is avoiding germs, but many shoppers are finding going online is easier and more convenient. The same goes for grocery shopping as people have their groceries delivered to their door. With same-day and next day delivery, people are finding little reason to drive to a mall.</p><strong>Shift to online shopping.&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Shift away from restaurants to eating at home.&nbsp;</strong>After decades of eating more meals at restaurants and fast food places, people are enjoying cooking and eating at home – and saving money while doing so. Many restaurants will never reopen after the virus is contained because demand will continue to be down, partially offset by the increase in take-out and home delivery.</p><strong>Shift away from restaurants to eating at home.&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Telemedicine.&nbsp;</strong>Being able to communicate directly with your doctor via telemedicine has obvious benefits over having to set up an appointment many weeks in advance and then have to drive to your doctor’s office. However, the shift to telemedicine has been impeded by archaic reimbursement rules requiring in-person visits. With the COVID-19 crisis, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is finally approving reimbursement for telemedicine and many insurers are following suit.</p><strong>Telemedicine.&nbsp;</strong><p>The effectiveness of telemedicine can be greatly enhanced with patient monitoring systems in the home that can transmit patient data to physicians over the Internet in real time, enabling people suffering from COVID-19 as well as heart failure, diabetes, etc. to stay at home yet still be in close touch with their physicians. In this way, only the sickest patients will have to be in hospitals.</p><p><strong>Self-care becomes the new primary care</strong>. We know that 50-70% of all health care costs are the result of lifestyles that people can control themselves, yet unhealthy behaviors persist. The threat of COVID-19 offers a unique opportunity to improve the immune system to cope with the virus by engaging in five essential self-care practices. If we follow them, self-care will become the new primary care.</p><strong>Self-care becomes the new primary care</strong><p>1. Eat a healthy diet, with emphasis on vegetables and fruits and limited meat.</p><p>2. No smoking, recreational drug use or excessive alcohol consumption.</p><p>3. Get an hour of exercise every day, including 10,000 steps.</p><p>4. Get 7.5-8 hours of sleep every night.</p><p>5. Have a daily practice of 20 minutes of mindfulness, meditation or prayer.</p><p>Meanwhile, the crisis will also change how companies operate:</p><p><strong>Revaluing front-line workers.&nbsp;</strong>For decades businesses have worked to decrease the cost of their front-line workers and have substituted layers of middle managers and consultants analyzing and controlling the work. The time is long overdue to reemphasize the importance of first-line employees. Firms like Walmart and Target stepped up early with special bonuses for their front-line workers, while employees at Amazon, Whole Foods and Instacart have gone on strike for improved safety conditions and better pay. As more firms like Amazon go to $15 per hour minimum wage, the yawning pay gap with the federal minimum wage of $7.25 per hour creates a dichotomy that should not be allowed to continue, even for small business.</p><strong>Revaluing front-line workers.&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Reducing middle managers, project managers and consultants.</strong>&nbsp;In the past two decades, focus on systems and processes to reduce costs of first-line workers has led to more layers of middle managers, analysts and reams of consultants, creating an “analysis paralysis” and a proliferation of complex power point charts.&nbsp; It is time to refocus on front-line workers and eliminate much of the cost of managing them. Middle managers, for example, can become district sales leaders instead of district sales managers, in order to concentrate on their most important accounts. Instead of engineering project managers, we should have project leaders, and the same for all other functions. Instead of using consultants to do the work of management, companies should give the challenges to their own employees, who know the business far better than any consultant could.</p><strong>Reducing middle managers, project managers and consultants.</strong><p><strong>Curtailing travel</strong>. Because of the Coronavirus, we have learned to have meetings online. Systems like Zoom and Skype are working well, even for large groups. Because everyone can see their faces, attendees tend to be more present and less distracted than on conference calls.&nbsp; Think about how much of your time is required to fly to Shanghai or Zurich for a business review or customer meeting, to say nothing of the wear-and-tear on your body from changes in time zones and loss of sleep. Or even to fly from LA to New York for a meeting? How much more efficient and effective would people be if they could use this travel time productively?</p><strong>Curtailing travel</strong><p><strong>Shortening meetings.&nbsp;</strong>Home-bound use of Zoom or Skype for meetings is teaching us more efficient ways of doing things. How would the work schedule change for all of us if we rarely traveled outside our home and office, and cut our meetings down to average of 45 minutes? This alone would free up our time and enhance our family and personal lives.</p><strong>Shortening meetings.&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Increasing the use of temporary and part-time workers.</strong>&nbsp;While tens of millions of people in permanent jobs are being laid off, millions more are being hired into temporary and part-time jobs by firms like Walmart, Amazon, Target, Domino’s Pizza, FedEx and UPS as people shift to shopping online and ordering food delivery. These jobs bring their own share of problems like impermanence and lack of benefits, but they will become more common even after the virus is contained.</p><strong>Increasing the use of temporary and part-time workers.</strong><p><strong>Accelerating digital transformation.&nbsp;</strong>Now is the time to accelerate every company’s transformation to be all-digital globally. Everyone should have access to the same information to do their jobs. This can eliminate a lot of the power points to present this information. Digital-first companies will assume employees have reviewed the data and focus their time on resolving important issues.</p><strong>Accelerating digital transformation.&nbsp;</strong><p>For all of the terrible tragedies brought on by COVID-19, turmoil inevitably unlocks innovation. These new ways of working more efficiently not only will change the nature of the workplace, but will make companies more effective. Companies who figure out how to use today’s adversity to invent tomorrow’s workplace will prosper in the long-term.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>As the Jewish people celebrate Passover this week, and Christians reexperience the death of Jesus on the cross on Good Friday, people throughout the world are suffering from Coronavirus. &nbsp;This is a good time to reflect on what we can learn from these experiences, and how we can learn new ways of living and working.</p><p>The Buddha said, “All life is suffering,” but until this moment the world has never experienced such a collective suffering – a suffering caused by an invisible virus that invades our bodies, is passed from one person to the next, and ultimately causes the death of hundreds of thousands of people.

How can we find deeper spiritual meaning from this experience?”</p><p>Here are some of my thoughts on this question:</p><ul>\n<li>We are learning again just how precious life and our health are.</li>\n<li>We are reconnecting with our families in new and more meaningful ways.</li>\n<li>We are caring for each other even as we are separated and learning to be connected while apart.</li>\n<li>We are appreciating the importance of community and finding new ways to create community.</li>\n<li>We are asking ourselves whether all our busyness leads to a better life.</li>\n<li>We are realizing just how superficial our materialistic desires are.</li>\n<li>We are recognizing what is truly important in life and the role love plays in our lives.</li>\n<li>We are recommitting to make a difference in the world, using our gifts to help other people.</li>\n<li>We are exploring our spiritual lives again, trusting in our belief in the Higher Power.</li>\n<li>We believe we will emerge from this experience wiser, more caring, and more intentional in living lives with meaning.</li>\n</ul><li>We are learning again just how precious life and our health are.</li><li>We are reconnecting with our families in new and more meaningful ways.</li><li>We are caring for each other even as we are separated and learning to be connected while apart.</li><li>We are appreciating the importance of community and finding new ways to create community.</li><li>We are asking ourselves whether all our busyness leads to a better life.</li><li>We are realizing just how superficial our materialistic desires are.</li><li>We are recognizing what is truly important in life and the role love plays in our lives.</li><li>We are recommitting to make a difference in the world, using our gifts to help other people.</li><li>We are exploring our spiritual lives again, trusting in our belief in the Higher Power.</li><li>We believe we will emerge from this experience wiser, more caring, and more intentional in living lives with meaning.</li><div></div>"

      "<p>The current economic crisis is providing significant challenges for leaders throughout the business, government, and nonprofit sectors. Their ability to lead in a crisis will be sorely tested and will often determine whether their institutions fail or survive the crisis. The best leaders are those who are wise enough to use crises like these to strengthen their organizations for the long term. Sadly, many leaders have failed the test, though others are emerging as outstanding leaders.</p><p>There is nothing quite like a crisis to test your leadership. It will make or break you. Like a war, a crisis tests your limits because the outcome is rarely predictable. You not only have to use all your wisdom to guide your organization through it, but also dig deep inside yourself to find the courage to keep going forward. So who will pass the test? What have successful leaders done to set themselves apart? In my new book, 7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis, I examine a wide range of crises that hundreds of leaders have faced and how they dealt with them. This book is aimed at helping leaders at all levels of organizations, from those in the early stages of their careers to recently appointed CEOs. The book profiles successful leaders—PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi, IBM’s Sam Palmisano, Apple’s Steve Jobs, and Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett—as well as leaders who have not fared so well, such as Chuck Prince of Citigroup, Martin Sullivan of AIG, and Richard Fuld of Lehman Brothers. From this examination, I derived seven lessons that apply to all types of crises, from external events like economic downturns, hostile takeovers, and weatherrelated disasters to internal problems such as product quality and recalls, accounting scandals and earnings shortfalls, legal and ethical issues, and organizational upheavals. These seven eternal lessons will be immediately applicable to all types of leaders throughout organizations in dealing with current and future predicaments.</p><h3>Lesson #1: Face Reality, Starting with Yourself</h3><p>Before you can lead your organization through a crisis, you have to acknowledge that you are indeed in one. Next you have to get everyone else to acknowledge it as well. Only then can you define the problems accurately and develop plans to deal with them. This is a difficult task, as leaders often go into denial about the urgency and severity of the challenges they are facing. Without accepting the problem is theirs to fix, they cannot understand what they are dealing with.</p><p>However, even when leaders acknowledge their responsibility, they may face significant resistance from their organizations in solving it, as people have great difficulty admitting their mistakes. This is why crises require so much skill on the leader’s part. For example, Warren Buffett’s masterful stewardship of Salomon Brothers in 1991 is clear evidence of the importance of skilled experience in leadership. And while leadership as a skill is important, the capacity for grasping the reality of a situation is equally vital. Denying reality destroys more careers and organizations than incompetence ever did. Instead of asking yourself why it is so difficult for other leaders to face reality, ask yourself instead, “Why is it so hard for you?”</p><p><strong>The Critical Message:</strong> The crisis isn’t going to fix itself, so denying its existence can only make things worse—much worse. That reality must start with you and your acknowledgment of your role in the crisis itself. Then you have to guide your entire organization to face reality as well.</p><strong>The Critical Message:</strong><h3>Lesson #2: Don’t Be Atlas; Get the World Off Your Shoulders</h3><p>Do you ever feel like Atlas, like you’re carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders? Like the whole organization is depending on you, and you’re not sure you can pull it off? And that if you don’t, everything you have built for years will collapse overnight?</p><p>Faced with a pending crisis, many leaders feel that heavy burden and choose to take it entirely on themselves, turning inward and away from their colleagues and staff. One of the reasons leaders turn inward is that they fear failure and loss of self-esteem. And though it is easier said than done, if you embrace your fears instead of running from them, they will gradually dissolve. One of the best ways to do this is to turn to your corporate teammates and the important people in your personal world for help and support. A prime example of the importance and effectiveness of a trusted support network can be found in Greg Steinhafel’s stewardship of Target as CEO in 2008. With the U.S. economy in a free fall, Target had fallen behind Wal-Mart in store sales, and Steinhafel was facing pressure from activist investors to institute risky financial solutions. Instead of caving under the pressure, Steinhafel called upon directors and staff, his trusted mentor Bob Ulrich, and even outside financial advisors and legal counsel to formulate a comprehensive plan. With the right support and advisory structure in place, he then calmly and efficiently ushered Target back to prosperity.</p><p><strong>The Critical Message:</strong> The essential learning here is that you cannot get through a crisis alone, so don’t try.&nbsp;The good news is you are not alone. People inside your organization and in your personal circle are more than willing to help you, if you ask them and are willing to open up. You will be much more effective in getting through a crisis when you get the world off your shoulders and share burdens with others.</p><strong>The Critical Message:</strong><h3>Lesson #3: Dig Deep for the Root Cause</h3><p>In the early stages of a crisis, it is easy to mistake the first symptoms that appear for the entire problem. It is human nature to attempt to fix the symptoms before the root cause is determined. Complicating the matter is the fact that, as a leader, your natural instinct is to challenge bearers of bad news about whether things can really be that bad, or whether they are just “doom and gloom” people.</p><p>You’re inclined to jump in and implement a solution to make the problem go away so your company can continue to move forward. However, if you move too fast to devise solutions, you may underestimate the depth of the problem, or misjudge its root cause, as the problem may be more serious than anyone appreciates. Another caveat is that if you surround yourself only with positive people, your team may reinforce your natural instincts to solve the problem before it is fully understood. Thus, you fix it with Band-Aids rather than surgery, while letting the real problem fester. Or your “quick fix” may eradicate the symptoms of the problem while masking its root cause.</p><p>Unless the root cause is corrected, the odds are high that the organization will find itself in yet another crisis in just a matter of years. It’s your job as a leader to prevent that, or next time around things will be a lot worse. It isn’t easy to determine whether you’ve gotten to the root cause. The only way to do so is to gather all your experts to analyze the problem and give them time to reach definitive conclusions.</p><p>When your organization is confident it has developed corrective solutions, an intense effort is required to implement the solutions. As the leader, however, you should express cautious optimism, but not complete confidence, that you have an acceptable solution.</p><p><strong>The Critical Message:</strong> An organization cannot deal with a crisis until it determines its root cause, but people are often mentally blocked from recognizing it because the implications are often so frightening. So the leader must bring people together to confront their worst fears and address the risks. In Medtronic’s 1998 crisis, I learned my teammates were only willing to commit to the aggressive course of action when I was willing to take those risks on my shoulders. The hesitancy and fears of failure that many felt were then channeled into turning this risky decision into a major success.</p><strong>The Critical Message:</strong><h3>Lesson #4: Get Ready for the Long Haul</h3><p>It is tempting to think of crises as events you have to weather until things return to normal. As hard as it is to predict when a crisis will hit, it is even more difficult to forecast when it will end. And as bad as things may seem at the outset, more often than not the situation deteriorates before it gets better.</p><p>Unfortunately, leaders often fail to even see the crisis coming. Rather than acknowledging they should have recognized the signals in time, they blame external events and things outside their control. Many behave as if the crisis came out of nowhere, or was an act of God. Reality is usually very different. Xerox CEO Anne Mulcahy says, “A lot of crises seem to happen overnight, but they have really long roots, like 10 to 15 years in terms of the source of the real problems.”</p><p><strong>The Critical Message:</strong> When facing the early stages of a crisis, it is essential not to declare victory too soon. Many leaders will learn from the global economic crisis not to underestimate the length and severity of crises they face, even if their crises have nothing to do with the economy. Prudent leaders recognize that survivability is their most important goal, so that they can come back strong as the crisis subsides.</p><strong>The Critical Message:</strong><h3>Lesson #5: Never Waste a Good Crisis</h3><p>In The Prince, Italian philosopher Niccolo Machiavelli advised his followers, “Never waste the opportunities offered by a good crisis.” Although it is hard to recognize at the time, a crisis provides a unique opportunity to create transformative change in your organization.</p><p>General Motors is a prime example of a company that wasted a good crisis. For three decades, GM management ignored the crises it faced. Management treated them as short-term events to get through, rather than opportunities to transform the company. Frequently, its executives turned to the U.S. government to help the company out of its predicaments: GM made requests to impose import quotas on foreign-made vehicles and delay federally mandated increases in fuel efficiency, and even lobbied the government to take over its health care benefits. By the time the automotive market collapsed in late 2008, it was too late for GM, and management was forced to turn its ownership over to the U.S. government.</p><p>Contrast GM’s experience with the visionary leadership of Jack Welch. When he was elevated to CEO of General Electric in 1981, Welch saw a world ahead that few others recognized. He envisioned intense global competition in which only the leanest and most competitive firms would survive. To get his slow moving, mature organization to go along, Welch created a crisis. He shifted key positions to executives who agreed with his philosophy and retired the rest. There was no challenge he did not tackle. No detail was too small to escape his attention, and perhaps his wrath. He eliminated 100,000 jobs, including many layers of staff and line. In the process, he turned GE’s bureaucracy into a high-performance machine.</p><p><strong>The Critical Message:</strong> Leaders who don’t take advantage of crises to make long-term changes not only waste their opportunities, but also sow the seeds for a repeat experience. Like GM, your organization will face these risks if you don’t make the changes that are required.</p><strong>The Critical Message:</strong><h3>Lesson #6: You’re in the Spotlight: Don’t Lose Track of True North</h3><p>For years I have explored the concept of a person’s “True North,” the internal compass that drives you to success. During a crisis, the spotlight on leaders is turned up to maximum intensity, and a leader’s True North is put to the test. People are so nervous and hungry for information that they hang on every word from their leaders, trying to glean clues from their body language, facial expressions, and even the color of their ties and dresses. In a crisis, everything is amplified one hundredfold.</p><p>The key to handling public issues is to be open, straightforward, and transparent. In a crisis, both employees and external observers are extremely sensitive to any attempts to dissemble or hide the truth. These will quickly be exposed, especially if subsequent events reveal your statements to be inaccurate or misleading.</p><p>Being transparent creates an open and human image of the organization. Its leaders seem like normal people who are tasked to take on difficult challenges. When you are open, you are better positioned to ask people for their support. If things get worse, as they often do, people are more sympathetic to your point of view if you have kept them fully informed. During this time, you should be highly accessible within your organization, wandering around the offices and labs, visiting factories, and participating in events around the company.</p><p><strong>The Critical Message:</strong> These days the intensity of the spotlight is so great that leaders cannot get away with dissembling or being intentionally misleading. There are so many different channels for information to become public that the truth will eventually come to the surface. The velocity of information transmission is so fast that leaders must establish the groundwork for transparent communications long before the crisis hits. The key is getting out in front of the crisis in its first hours with clear statements, both internally and externally, that accept responsibility and build confidence and credibility with all your constituents.</p><strong>The Critical Message:</strong><h3>Lesson #7: Go on Offense, Focus on Winning</h3><p>Look at a crisis as a gift. It provides you a golden opportunity that may not come again to reshape your business and your industry and emerge as the winner. But you must be bold and focused.</p><p>In a crisis, many leaders assume if they can just get through it, everything will return to normal. So they hunker down and wait for the storm to pass. While they are hunkering down, they lose ground to their competitors who are reshaping the market.</p><p>Why not reshape the market yourself? First, you need a clear vision of what future markets will look like. This requires a keen understanding of how your customers’ needs will change as a result of the crisis. Second, you need a focused strategy to reshape markets to play to your strengths, while exposing your competitors’ weaknesses.</p><p>Then you’ve got to move aggressively to put your strategies into action, just as forcefully as you did to survive the crisis. If you can pull this off, you may be able to catch your competitors off guard. By the time they wake up to what your organization is doing, you will have solidified your leadership of the post crisis market.</p><p>A key part of this post crisis maneuvering includes making investments for the downturn. Visionary companies gear their businesses for the long term by preparing for sharp economic swings so that they can invest during the downturn. They recognize their competitors are likely to pull back investments when the economy turns down and markets decline. Well-led companies are aware of the lead time for capital investments, and they know they must invest heavily in downturns or they won’t be ready for the upswing. Doing so takes substantial cash balances to withstand downturns while funding the expanded investment.</p><p>There are seven crucial factors to keep in mind in order to keep on the offensive:</p><h4><strong>7 Steps to Focus on Winning: </strong></h4><strong>7 Steps to Focus on Winning: </strong><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Rethink Your Industry Strategy</p><strong>Step 1:</strong><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Shed Your Weaknesses</p><strong>Step 2:</strong><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Reshape the Industry to Play to Your Strengths</p><strong>Step 3:</strong><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Make Vital Investments During the Downturn</p><strong>Step 4:</strong><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Keep Key People Focused on Winning</p><strong>Step 5:</strong><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Create Your Company’s Image as the Industry Leader</p><strong>Step 6:</strong><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Develop Rigorous Execution Plans</p><strong>Step 7:</strong><p><strong>The Critical Message:</strong> Keep your head up during a crisis, rather than hunkering down, and maintain a laser-like focus on winning in the emerging marketplace. This period offers the best opportunity you will ever have to reshape markets to your advantage. The best leaders emerge from a crisis as winners because they are both aggressive and courageous in turning challenges into advantages. Beyond that, they are passionate about using their leadership to make a difference in the world.</p><strong>The Critical Message:</strong><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>The crisis you are facing—or inevitably will face—may be the defining moment in your professional life. Your defining moment comes when your life story collides with a crisis in the midst of your path. Here, you learn who you really are. When you are under enormous pressure and the consequences are greatest for you, will you be prepared to follow your True North?</p><p>This moment defines you to others as well. People remember how leaders respond in a crisis because intuitively they know this is the authentic test of the person. Each of us has the opportunity to make a difference in the world by leading others through crises to change a small portion of events. If we learn our leadership lessons well, then the history of this new generation will most assuredly be great</p><p>The world is crying out for your leadership. We face six major problems that are so pressing that we must address them now: global peace, health care, energy and the environment, job creation, income disparities, and education. These problems are so large and intractable that no one organization can possibly solve them on its own. That’s why they require each of us to use our leadership gifts to contribute to changing a small portion of these problems.</p><p>The time is ripe for you to step up and lead people through the current crisis. Be bold in your leadership because boldness has genius, power, and magic in it. If you stay on the course of your True North, you can make a lasting difference in the world. This is the ultimate fulfillment of leading people through a crisis.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>Now is the time for leaders to inspire their organizations to help the world through the COVID-19 crisis.&nbsp;<b>Bill George</b>&nbsp;has a list of authentic leaders who are up to the challenge.</p><b>Bill George</b><p>We are in the greatest crisis of our lifetimes—even worse than 9/11 and the 2008-09 financial meltdown that triggered the Great Recession. This crisis is directly affecting every person, even those who don’t recognize it yet.</p><p>Now is a time for leaders, particularly authentic leaders, to step up to the challenges and inspire their organizations to help the world work its way through these difficult times.</p><p>In a crisis like this, there is no place for leaders to be bragging or overpromising the capabilities of their company or using this crisis for competitive wins or publicity for themselves or their companies. If ever there was a time for leaders to be authentic, this is it. They need to be humble, open, and realistic about the health care and logistical challenges they are facing while using the best scientific and technical talent in their organizations to address the complexities of the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><blockquote><p>“IF EVER THERE WAS A TIME FOR LEADERS TO BE AUTHENTIC, THIS IS IT.”</p></blockquote><p>“IF EVER THERE WAS A TIME FOR LEADERS TO BE AUTHENTIC, THIS IS IT.”</p><p>Fortunately, many of our corporate and scientific leaders are already stepping up, unselfishly taking action to stop the spread of the virus and minimize its health and economic impact. Here is my personal “Heroes List” of authentic leaders who are making a difference in overcoming the challenges of COVID-19:</p><p><b>Dr. Anthony Fauci,</b>&nbsp;director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has been at the center of every virus attack for the past 30 years, from SARS and MERS to Ebola and H1N1. Now, at 79, Fauci is the central figure that Americans depend upon to lead us through this crisis with his honest, candid advice and counsel. Last week he was on all five Sunday talk shows and then on a Facebook Live show with Mark Zuckerberg, followed by the CNN Town Hall with Dr. Sanjay Gupta.</p><b>Dr. Anthony Fauci,</b><p><b>Thomas Schinecker,</b>&nbsp;CEO of Roche Diagnostics, leads a company that received the FDA’s&nbsp;<a class=\"ext\" href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/fda-grants-roche-coronavirus-test-emergency-green-light-within-24-hours\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first emergency use authorization</a>&nbsp; for a commercially developed COVID-19 test on March 13. Roche now believes it can ship up to 400,000 test kits per week.</p><b>Thomas Schinecker,</b><a href=\"https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/fda-grants-roche-coronavirus-test-emergency-green-light-within-24-hours\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">first emergency use authorization</a><p><b>Kenneth Frazier</b>, CEO of Merck. His company is the leading American manufacturer of antibiotics—those life-saving drugs required for pneumonia caused by COVID-19—as others&nbsp;<a class=\"ext\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/major-pharmaceutical-companies-dropping-antibiotic-projects-superbugs-2018-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have abandoned them</a>&nbsp;to pursue more lucrative drugs. Frazier elected to stay in the business because he knows how essential antibiotics are for people. Last week he confronted a different challenge: keeping Merck’s antibiotic factory running after school closures forced employees with children to stay home.</p><b>Kenneth Frazier</b><a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/major-pharmaceutical-companies-dropping-antibiotic-projects-superbugs-2018-7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">have abandoned them</a><p><b>Omar Ishrak</b>, Medtronic CEO, leads a global company of 100,000 people. His greatest challenge currently is ramping production of desperately needed ventilators from the Medtronic factory in Galway, Ireland. He has publicly committed to double production from 5,000 to 10,000 units per month, but that is just the start. Next come the challenges of getting supplies from all over the world, hiring and training new employees, and finally, sorting out massive international orders from hospitals and governments. Separately, Medtronic is using its remote monitoring capabilities to track people with coronavirus in their homes. (Full disclosure: I am a former chair and CEO of Medtronic).</p><b>Omar Ishrak</b><p><b>Adam Schechter, LabCorp CEO, and Stephen Rusckowski, Quest CEO</b>, face the challenge of ramping up tests for COVID-19 in their labs as pressure mounts for rapid and accurate test results. LabCorp and Quest, the world’s largest blood testing agencies, weren’t engaged to take on this Herculean task until March 13 because the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) insisted on controlling the tests. Now both companies are going all out on testing.</p><b>Adam Schechter, LabCorp CEO, and Stephen Rusckowski, Quest CEO</b><p><b>Dr. Gianrico Farrugia</b>, CEO of Mayo Clinic, was faced with the painful decision to shut down all elective surgery in order to focus treating COVID-19 patients and other emergency cases. In addition, Mayo has developed and verified its own test for COVID-19 and is currently able to run 1,000 tests per day.</p><b>Dr. Gianrico Farrugia</b><p><b>David A. Ricks</b>, CEO of Eli Lilly. Under Ricks’ guidance, Lilly has teamed with AbCellera Biologics to find antibodies to disarm COVID-19.

      "<p>Each day the COVID-19 crisis worsens in the United States.</p><p>Cases in the last three days have doubled. The number of deaths has also doubled. Yet we still grossly undercount the number of cases because we only test the sickest people. The curves tracking the spread of the disease and death rates all race upward. The worst situation is in major cities, but that does not mean this coronavirus won’t spread rapidly to rural areas as it has in Colorado.</p><p>Right now, the disease is growing in geometric terms: worldwide it took 10 weeks for the first 100,000 cases, 10 days for the second 100,000 and 3 days for the third 100,000. We need to contain the spread of COVID-19 or the human toll both in health and in economic terms will be staggering. The only way we can get control over it is to take more aggressive measures immediately to contain the spread of the disease. That is what China, South Korea, Vietnam and Singapore have done. Wuhan, China – once the epicenter of the virus, which took the most dramatic measures to quarantine its population of 11 million – has not <a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">reported</a> a case in the last four days.&nbsp;Meanwhile, failure to move quickly in Italy, Iran and Germany has resulted in the rapid spread of the virus and overwhelmed health care systems.</p><a href=\"https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/china/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\">reported</a><p>It is now time for President Trump to issue a nationwide “Shelter in Place” order. Governors in California, New York, New Jersey, Illinois and Connecticut have already done so, but other states are moving slowly to recognize the inevitability of COVID-19’s spread to their cities and states.</p><p>In its simplest terms, “Shelter in Place” means only leaving your home for essential foods and pharmaceuticals. It also permits people to go outside for exercise as long as they stay six feet away from other people. All schools and universities physically close. All non-essential businesses physically close, and operate on-line. &nbsp;Exceptions to this nationwide order would include health care workers, medical companies producing vital medical supplies, employees engaged in the production and distribution of food, beverages and pharmaceuticals, people in required public service positions, and essential jobs engaged in communication and online commerce.</p><p>A “Shelter in Place” order should be accompanied by other measures to help end the crisis, including:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rapidly expand hospital capacity through construction of emergency overflow treatment centers ensuring treatment options are available to all citizens</p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Issue the Defense Mobilization order to achieve 10X the production of necessary masks, protective gear, and medical equipment such as ventilators</p><p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continue to expand testing capabilities of private testing companies to increase capacity rapidly</p><p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Track all people who have been in contact with a diagnosed case</p><p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Communicate this plan and daily updates to the public from the White House Task Force lead by Vice President Pence, along with direct text messages to every American with a cell phone</p><p>A nationwide “Shelter in Place” will severely hurt the economy in the short-term, but with it, we <em>can </em>get control over the spread of this deadly virus in the next two months and put the country back to work. That is what China is doing because it took control early.&nbsp;If we contain the virus by the end of May, the economic impact in the long run will be far less damaging than the piecemeal approaches being taken now.

      "<p><strong>John Visentin</strong>&nbsp;is speaking with the simmering impatience of someone who’s 100% sure his opponents are 100% wrong. “They want to block us with a poison pill, telling their investors they aren’t bright enough to make up their own minds,” he fumes. “That really annoys me!”</p><strong>John Visentin</strong><p>The “they” here is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/hp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HP</a>&nbsp;Inc. And Visentin, CEO of venerable printer-maker&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/xerox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xerox</a>&nbsp;Holdings, is building a case for one of the most audacious takeover quests in recent memory. In November, Xerox made a guppy-devours-the-whale bid to buy HP, an offer now set at $35&nbsp;billion. Today, with a cliffhanger proxy battle looming, HP’s countermoves are irking the takeover architect.</p><a href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/hp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HP</a><a href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/xerox/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Xerox</a><p>Visentin, a plainspoken 57-year-old from a blue-collar Canadian family, is the antithesis of a swashbuckler. He’s a career tech guy whose résumé includes a few stellar years in private equity and a stint as an executive vice president at the old Hewlett-Packard. But he’s capable of waxing passionate about his plans. “Printing is long overdue for consolidation,” he says, during an interview at Xerox’s anonymous glass-cube headquarters in Connecticut. “The potential for cutting costs, for investing for the future, is tremendous.” HP, he says, is thwarting Xerox by promising huge share buybacks: “How is that investing for the future?”</p><p>Thirty years ago, a Xerox-HP takeover battle might have dominated the headlines. Today, these aging giants operate far from the spotlight. But they still run richly profitable printing businesses, generating cash that could finance the kinds of transformation that Visentin envisions. What makes his bid particularly bold is that it has been decades since a company Xerox’s size has succeeded in buying a rival that’s so much bigger. In 2019, Xerox posted sales of $9.1&nbsp;billion—less than one-sixth of the $58.8&nbsp;billion HP tallied in its most recent fiscal year.</p><p>One person’s “bold,” of course, is another person’s crazy. To finance the merger, Xerox would take on $24&nbsp;billion in new debt. <strong>“It makes no sense because all that debt would make the combined company much riskier,” says Bill George, former CEO of Medtronic and a professor at Harvard Business School.</strong> HP brass, who oppose the merger, argue that the leverage would threaten the companies’ survival. “You can’t work through economic cycles with that level of debt,” says CFO Steve Fieler, who calls Visentin’s $2&nbsp;billion in planned annual savings “unachievable.”</p><strong>“It makes no sense because all that debt would make the combined company much riskier,” says Bill George, former CEO of Medtronic and a professor at Harvard Business School.</strong><p>Xerox’s offer—now $24 a share, a premium of about 20% over HP’s mid-March stock price—will face a vote at HP’s annual shareholder meeting, expected in May. Rooting for a deal is activist titan Carl Icahn. He’s Xerox’s largest investor, with an 11% stake, worth about $750 million; he also owns 4.4% of HP, worth some $1.3&nbsp;billion. Icahn led a campaign in 2018 that blocked Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings from purchasing Xerox. He then backed a new management team headed by Visentin, who became Xerox CEO that May. Icahn claims that a combination promises huge gains for both sides. “I want to own the stock of the merged companies,” he tells&nbsp;<em>Fortune</em>, “and Visentin is a tough guy and the right guy to run it.”</p><em>Fortune</em><p>If Xerox wins the proxy battle, a new HP board will likely approve the deal. But HP may persuade its shareholders to rebuff Xerox, or even turn around and buy Xerox—a deal proposed by, among others, Carl Icahn. Whatever the outcome, Visentin’s bid could shake up a backwater of the tech world by highlighting a strategy that has revived mature industries from autos to airlines: consolidation.</p><p><strong>Printers may</strong>&nbsp;be unglamorous, but they’re also a $206-billion-a-year industry. Though revenues are shrinking as clients turn to digital documents, those boxy appliances produce enormous cash flow, as customers keep paying for years for paper, maintenance, and pricey toner cartridges.</p><strong>Printers may</strong><p data-inc=\"1\">The field encompasses 12 major players, including HP, Xerox, and eight Japanese companies. Mergers could offer this gaggle some advantages: Combined, companies could slash costs by reducing headcount and winning lower prices on outsourced parts and services. They would then have more cash to invest in faster-growing arenas, including 3D printing and customized digital printing.</p><p>If such a strategy succeeded, it could pay off disproportionately for investors. HP and Xerox trade at a dirt-cheap 7.5 and 5.4 times free cash flow, respectively, reflecting investors’ belief that they’ll keep shrinking. The average multiple for the S&amp;P&nbsp;500, by contrast, is 19, and a growth surge could help their shares close that gap.</p><p>Boosters of an HP-Xerox merger point out that each focuses on different parts of the market. HP’s $20.1&nbsp;billion printing business specializes in desktop printers, a category called A4s. Xerox relies mostly on A3s, the huge multipurpose models used by businesses. In most cases, it leases them on contracts through which it provides supplies and maintenance.</p><p>Last year, Xerox produced free cash flow of $1.3 billion and HP of almost $4 billion. Visentin argues that he can produce $2&nbsp;billion in new yearly savings—and the healthier margins and investment opportunities that come with them—by combining Xerox and HP. At Xerox, Visentin has delivered on the cost cutting: The company has sharply reduced what it spends on outsourcing such functions as IT management and payroll and medical claims management, lowering total expenses by almost 10% in 2019. The question now is whether HP’s investors will let him take his shears to their company.</p><p><strong>To woo investors</strong>, HP is taking a cash-is-king approach. On Feb.&nbsp;24 it unveiled a plan to buy back $15&nbsp;billion in stock over three years and pledged to return 100% of free cash flow to shareholders. CEO Enrique Lores tells&nbsp;<em>Fortune</em>&nbsp;that Visentin’s bid both undervalues HP and would leave it overleveraged. HP is open to acquisitions, he says, but can expand sales and profits without them, by shifting the product mix to faster-growing business lines—including, yes, 3D and digital printing.</p><strong>To woo investors</strong><em>Fortune</em><p>While Wall Street analysts are skeptical of that claim, HP’s countermoves have won some converts. “The cash return program probably moved HP from a disadvantage to a slight advantage,” one institutional shareholder says. This investor believes Xerox could regain its edge by raising its offer price by $2 to $3 a share. But that could mean taking on even more debt, a precarious proposition.</p><p>If Xerox looks like the winner as the vote approaches, it’s possible HP will bid for Xerox. Indeed, in a Feb.&nbsp;27 proxy filing, HP gave a detailed narrative of negotiations on just that topic. According to the filing, Icahn and Visentin proposed selling Xerox to HP at around $45 a share—a huge premium over Xerox’s early March price of $32. But even at that price, it’s a move that HP, with its much larger revenue stream, could afford.</p><p>The best long-term outcome for shareholders may involve HP buying Xerox. The combined company would carry much less debt, probably less than $10&nbsp;billion net of cash holdings, leaving more cash to invest in R&amp;D and acquisitions, even as it reaches more customers. The problem, in some shareholders’ eyes: If HP is the buyer, Visentin and his “Let’s not copy, let’s reinvent” mindset might be sidelined. And the benefits of consolidation may mean that a Xerox acquisition is better than none.</p><p data-inc=\"2\">If HP becomes the buyer, the boardroom maneuvering will undergo some fascinating twists. HP would need to convince institutional investors that it isn’t overpaying, lest they flip their support to Xerox. It would also likely need to propose a friendly merger to the same Xerox management that it has been trashing as irresponsible. The deadline for HP to unseat Xerox’s board in a hostile takeover at its annual meeting has passed for 2020, a scenario that Jim Woolery of King &amp; Spalding, Xerox’s lawyer, says gives his client an advantage.</p><p>Darwin Deason knows who he’s cheering for. The 80-year-old Texan sold an outsourcing services company to Xerox in 2010 and still owns 4% of its stock; it was Deason who teamed with Icahn, 84, to block the Fuji takeover. Deason says he’s amused to be “at my last rodeo, fighting for the little guy to buy the big guy, when it almost always goes the other way around. But here I am riding the bull!” If that bull breaks some dishes in the sleepy china shop of the printer industry, the two octogenarians won’t be the only ones who profit.</p><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/03/16/xerox-hp-takeover/\">Fortune.com</a> on 3/16/20.</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/03/16/xerox-hp-takeover/\">Fortune.com</a> on 3/16/20.</em><a href=\"https://fortune.com/2020/03/16/xerox-hp-takeover/\">Fortune.com</a><div></div>"

Meanwhile, stock exchanges have been indicating a coming recession for two weeks, as stock prices have gyrated wildly, falling 20% until a partial recovery on the heels of the President’s announcement, according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://yhoo.it/390F2sx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">analysis of data for the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Yahoo Finance</a>. After the Federal Reserve’s emergency cut on Tuesday of 50 basis points, or half a percentage point, of interest rates failed to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/03/economy-coronavirus-rate-cuts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">stem declining equity prices</a>, the Fed followed with another cut on Sunday evening.

The U.S. federal government should ask Americans to voluntarily quarantine themselves in their homes until the peak infection period passes, as many states have already done. This would cause the spread of the disease to end faster and therefore allow a normal resumption of economic activity to occur sooner. This requires a containment strategy wherein most Americans, except essential workers, self-quarantine in their homes. Such a decision will result in major reductions in the U.S. consumer economy, except for online purchases and essential food and pharmaceuticals, but it may prove to be the fastest way to get through the recession.</p><p>The question now is how long this recession will last. In economists’ terms, will it be a V-shaped recession, an U-shaped recession, or an L-shaped recession? Let’s examine these possible scenarios.</p><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/v-shaped-recovery.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">V-shaped recession</a>&nbsp;would indicate a sharp downturn for the next several months, followed by rapid growth in early 2021. In this case, the economy would follow a pattern similar to the early 1950s, when the American economy dipped down for 12 months, followed by 12 months of recovery. If the U.S. gets coronavirus under control through swift containment measures, then that offers the greatest probability of a V-shaped economic rebound in 2021.</p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/v/v-shaped-recovery.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">V-shaped recession</a><p>The Great Recession that started in 2008 followed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/l-shaped-recession.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an L-shape</a>&nbsp;as it took nearly four years for recovery to pre-2008 levels. Drawing out the response to COVID-19 may simply increase the odds that the U.S. plunges into the much more severe L-shaped recession, which lasts a long time with only mediocre growth on the rebound.</p><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/l-shaped-recession.asp\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">an L-shape</a><p>Rather than trying to avoid a recession by keeping things running in a pseudo-normal manner and thereby accelerating the spread of coronavirus, the Trump administration should take the bitter medicine now of pushing for self-quarantines. In doing so, it may save the health of the American people and the American economy.</p><p><em>This content was originally published on Fortune.com on 3/16/2020.</em></p><em>This content was originally published on Fortune.com on 3/16/2020.</em><div></div>"

      "<p>President Donald Trump and his administration now face three major crises occurring simultaneously. First, there’s the spread of the coronavirus in the U.S., with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-updates-cases-fears-deaths-us-latest-2020-03-11/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 1,000 cases and 38 deaths reported</a>. Then there’s the oil price war that’s led to a drop in crude oil prices (<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/08/oil-plummets-30percent-as-opec-deal-failure-sparks-price-war-fears.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">down to $31.13 per barrel</a>). And finally, there’s the growing threat of a global economic recession, as reflected in the stock market’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/09/813619387/dow-dives-1-900-points-nyse-halts-trading-as-stock-indexes-plummet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decline of 2,013 points on Monday</a>.</p><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/live-updates/coronavirus-updates-cases-fears-deaths-us-latest-2020-03-11/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">over 1,000 cases and 38 deaths reported</a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/08/oil-plummets-30percent-as-opec-deal-failure-sparks-price-war-fears.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">down to $31.13 per barrel</a><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2020/03/09/813619387/dow-dives-1-900-points-nyse-halts-trading-as-stock-indexes-plummet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">decline of 2,013 points on Monday</a><p>It is relatively easy for leaders to look good when things go well but managing a crisis is the real test of leadership. In fairness to the President, none of these crises is of his making. That is the usual nature of crises—they occur when least expected.</p><p>How should President Trump handle the triple threat of these crises? There are six rules for leading in a crisis that every leader, including President Trump, should consider:</p><p><strong>1. Acknowledge the reality of the situation.</strong>&nbsp;Acknowledging the severity of the coronavirus has been difficult for the President, particularly considering the threat coronavirus represents to the economy and hence his reelection. Initially, Trump consistently tried to downplay the crisis. In the midst of Monday’s stock market meltdown, for instance, the President&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1237027356314869761\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tweeted</a>: “So last year 37,000 Americans died from the common Flu. It averages between 27,000 and 70,000 per year. Nothing is shut down, life &amp; the economy go on. At this moment there are 546 confirmed cases of coronavirus, with 22 deaths. Think about that!”</p><strong>1. Acknowledge the reality of the situation.</strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/1237027356314869761\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">tweeted</a><p>The President should face these realities: Now that the World Health Organization has declared coronavirus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/11/who-declares-the-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-pandemic.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a global pandemic</a>, every American is at risk; the rapid increases in U.S. oil and shale gas production are contributing to the global glut and driving down prices; and stock market declines are signaling a recession ahead.</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/11/who-declares-the-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-pandemic.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a global pandemic</a><p>The President should consider examining his approach and be more candid with the American people about the risks of the disease and its potential to spread. By understating the risks, he makes it more difficult for his administration to respond to the rapid growth of the virus and denying the severity of the issue will reduce his credibility in the future.</p><p><strong>2. Be truthful and transparent.</strong>&nbsp;During a crisis people depend upon their leaders to speak the truth and to be fully transparent; if they do not do so, trust evaporates quickly. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.people-press.org/2019/07/22/trust-and-distrust-in-america/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">2019 Pew Research Center poll</a>&nbsp;found that American’s public trust in federal governments has been in decline, with 68% believing that “it is very important to repair the public’s level of confidence in the federal government.”</p><strong>2.

Lead from the front.</strong>&nbsp;As a leader, President Trump is highly visible, an operating style that can serve him well in this time of crisis. Since the outbreak of coronavirus, he has visited the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and participated in the White House press briefings. This week, he is actively trying to devise solutions to lessen the economic impact on the country and individuals, meeting with members of Congress. But these steps may not be sufficient to stem the crisis, as more aggressive actions inevitably will be required.</p><strong>3. Lead from the front.</strong><p>Since the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/10/world/europe/russia-saudi-oil.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">oil price war resulted from issues</a>&nbsp;between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabian Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman—two leaders with whom the President has built strong relationships—he should broker a deal that restores oil prices to a normalized level.

The tough decisions facing the President now will inevitably involve tradeoffs between protecting people from exposure to coronavirus and the economic impact that will occur as a result. For the sake of the country, he should focus on protecting people and accept the short-term economic hit; in the end the economy will recover faster if the crisis is mitigated.</p><strong>5. Make hard decisions.&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/31/business/china-travel-coronavirus.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banned foreign tourists who had recently visited China, and quarantined some Americans,</a><p><strong>6. Get ready for the long haul.&nbsp;</strong>The U.S. needs a comprehensive plan to keep the economy moving; otherwise, a stock market decline could turn into a full-fledged recession. The measures contemplated like paid sick leave and payroll tax reductions are good initial steps, but short term in nature. Now the President needs to address the significant economic impact if coronavirus becomes a global pandemic and create a stimulus plan to restore economic growth. One place to start is to fund a major infrastructure program to repair America’s crumbling roads and bridges, a similar step to what President Barack Obama did in 2009 at the height of the financial crisis.</p><strong>6. Get ready for the long haul.&nbsp;</strong><p>President Trump’s most difficult challenges will come as the coronavirus expands, requiring even more protective measures that inevitably will slow down the economy. The collapse of oil prices will intensify the economic challenges facing the oil industry. The decline of the stock market will cause both consumers and businesses to hold back on spending on large purchases. Only visionary, aggressive leadership by the President will keep these three crises from plunging the U.S.—along with the rest of the world— into another crippling recession.</p><p><em>Bill George is senior fellow at Harvard Business School and former chair and CEO of Medtronic.

      "<p><em>By Laura Noonan, Financial Times</em></p><em>By Laura Noonan, Financial Times</em><p>Goldman Sachs spent most of its first 130 years shrouded in the secrecy of a partnership structure. It jealously guarded that mystique for its first two decades as a listed company.</p><p>But on Wednesday, David Solomon, who became chief executive in October 2018, will stand before a crush of shareholders, analysts and journalists at the bank’s first-ever investor day. It is effectively a coming-out party for a group that has spent the past two years planning a radical overhaul of its operations as it moves from its trading and investment banking roots to an institution offering everything from current accounts to money management and credit cards for the masses.</p><p>For peers on Wall Street such events are routine. Mr Solomon’s decision to pull back the veil and explain Goldman’s strategy is anything but. It is one of the many breaks with tradition the investment banker has made since taking control at Wall Street’s most storied bank.</p><p>Rivals such as JPMorgan Chase and Bank of America have blossomed in recent years as their big retail banks and cash management divisions — which help companies make and receive payments and manage their excess money — protected them from a 50 per cent fall in trading revenues in the decade after 2009. Even Morgan Stanley, which like Goldman lacks a retail bank, has weathered the storm better after restructuring its fixed income trading unit in 2015.</p><p>It left Goldman as the only US bank overly dependent on a bond and stock trading business characterized by plummeting margins, higher capital charges and fierce competition from hedge funds and other rivals. In June 2016, the bank’s valuation fell to its lowest level in four years.</p><p>“Lloyd [Blankfein] did a great job during his tenure [as chief executive] . . . but that was a time of tremendous incursion with Dodd-Frank [regulations], a lot of congressional intervention,” says Bill George, who was a Goldman Sachs board member from 2002 to 2019. “David came in really as the person to put the focus on growth,” he adds, citing the “critical” need to expand into new businesses.</p><p>After years of subpar returns, and amid criticism from shareholders, analysts and his own colleagues, Mr. Solomon began a sweeping review of how Goldman makes its money and what it needs to do to make more of it.</p><p>Some measures were cosmetic — mandatory formal dress was ditched in favour of a millennial-friendly “come as you like, express yourself” policy. The bank’s top leadership team — most of them appointed by Mr Solomon — are swapping their suites on the 41st floor of Goldman’s New York headquarters for the 12th, so they can be closer to the main businesses.</p><p>Other changes are more fundamental. Thousands of technology specialists have decamped from a central division into business lines, to have a more direct impact on products. Goldman bought a mass-market wealth management arm, United Capital, for $750m so it can sell its services to the merely wealthy as well as the enormously rich. It has launched a credit card with Apple, an addition to its mass market consumer business.</p><p>In parallel, Goldman has also cut back less profitable parts of its enormous trading business, diverted investment bankers to pursuing smaller clients and promised a “One Goldman” approach to serving clients — an admission that the bank has not always been collaborative in its approach to winning business.</p><p>A year in, and despite missing earnings forecasts for the past two quarters, Mr Solomon has claimed an early victory. But there is friction within the ranks. The changes threaten a culture clash between the traders and bankers who powered the Goldman of old, and the retail bankers, cash management experts and engineers who seem to hold the key to future growth.</p><p>Outside the company some ask whether it has lost its cachet. “We used to all want to be Goldman Sachs. Now Goldman Sachs seems to want to be Citigroup or JPMorgan,” says a senior rival investment banker.</p><p>The investor day is Mr Solomon’s chance to answer some of these questions, and to convince money managers, pension funds and private shareholders that the Goldman of the future will be able to end the poor returns of the recent past. In a comment that would have been unimaginable a decade ago, one senior executive says: “Investor day will be about explaining our reason for being.”</p><p>Marcus, Goldman’s consumer bank, is the epicentre for the company that Mr Solomon and his team are trying to build — a place where innovation and customer experience matter more than the prestige that the bank once prized.</p><p>The online venture was conceived in 2014, during the era of Mr Blankfein, the charismatic bond trader who ran Goldman for 12 years before Mr Solomon. The idea was to attract deposits that offered a cheaper source of funding than Goldman pays in the wholesale market. A US loans and deposits platform followed in 2016, and then a UK savings account two years later.</p><p>One recruit, who joined Marcus as the project picked up steam, says he saw an “opportunity to take a 150-year-old company and turn it several degrees”.</p><p>Mr Solomon turbocharged that effort, most notably through acquiring United Capital and striking the agreement with Apple, which he has repeatedly described as the “most successful credit card deal in history” — without providing evidence for the claim.</p><p>At its quarterly earnings announcement in January, Mr Solomon gave a glowing account of the consumer division’s progress, including a 67 per cent rise in deposits to $60bn in less than a year. Lower reserves on Marcus’s consumer loan losses also helped calm analyst fears about Goldman’s inexperience in underwriting consumer credit.</p><p>Yet some inside the consumer division are more critical of its evolution. One former employee says Goldman underestimated how long it would take to build the technology and products, then lost patience and abandoned them in favour of acquisitions, leading to wasted resources.</p><p>He offers personal finance management as one example — Goldman first asked its technologists to develop a platform but then bought Clarity Money in 2018. In mass-market wealth management, Goldman was already working on its own platform before the United Capital deal in 2019. “The veneer wore off and the patience wasn’t there to see a whole lot of it through,” he says.</p><p>A former colleague echoes this sentiment but others dispute it. “Unlike a start-up or a fintech, we can’t just work on a product for a couple of weeks and launch it into the marketplace,” says a senior figure at Marcus. “We have to release something that [matches] up to the standards of Goldman Sachs.”</p><p>The Apple Card is Goldman’s most high-profile consumer play. Infamous among Goldman’s tech team for gobbling up resources from other projects, the card quickly served up a swift lesson in how not to do business.</p><p>When it was launched in August, male customers took to Twitter to complain that they were given higher credit limits — in some cases allegedly 20 times higher — than their wives. That inspired an investigation by New York’s financial services department which has yet to report its findings.</p><p>“That was not helpful for us,” says a senior executive from one of Goldman’s traditional businesses. “It could have been better handled.”</p><p>Some Goldman executives already feel the consumer division — which accounted for just 2.3 per cent of total revenues last year — is getting a disproportionate amount of attention from Mr Solomon and other senior managers.</p><p>They want the investor day to focus more on places where Goldman actually makes money, say people familiar with the discussions. “It’ll be 2030 before you really see a shift in business,” says one, adding that people should invest in Goldman “for the here and now”.</p><p>The investor day — which will showcase some of the bank’s new technology — is expected to outline plans for its new cash management division. Mr Solomon will further explain how he plans to attract more client money into the merchant banking division and improve growth and returns at its traditional trading and investment banking units.</p><p>The internal tensions highlight why changing the culture of Goldman is such a long-term project. Company veterans describe a tradition of ruthless competition, where colleagues compete against each other for the same deals.</p><p>Goldman has, at various times, tried to encourage people to think beyond their own profit and loss account, but those efforts largely failed because pay packages were based on the old metric of how much money individuals brought in.</p><p>Ed Schein, an organisational structure specialist and professor emeritus at MIT, says it usually takes “five or 10 years” to change the culture of big organisations. “If the new way requires more collaboration between employees and they’ve been trained for 100 years to be individually competitive . . . it might take a long time,” he adds.</p><p>He suggests some “super individually competitive people” might “have to be invited out of the system”.</p><p>Goldman has already seen a lot of churn at the top of the business. Trading chiefs Pablo Salame and Isabelle Ealet left shortly before Mr Solomon took over, followed by technology boss Elisha Wiesel, former chief financial officer Marty Chavez and co-head of securities engineering Konstantin Shakhnovich.</p><p>“There was a massive regime change,” says one former partner. “We went from a 12-year run with Lloyd Blankfein who was a trader at heart . . . Even in tough times they didn’t want to de-emphasise that business, that was always viewed to be core to the firm.”</p><p>In investment banking, while senior managers insist everyone is on board with a push to pursue smaller clients — defined as those with an enterprise value of less than $2bn — some grumble about doing less prestigious deals.</p><p>Mr Solomon has made gender diversity a focal point, increasing women’s representation with the partners and managing directors appointed in 2018 and 2019 respectively.</p><p>But not all investors are convinced by his efforts. Mark Conrad, who invests in American financial stocks for fund manager Algebris, says he owns Morgan Stanley stock rather than Goldman because “GS is to some extent grasping at straws strategically”. He adds: “We believe Solomon is correctly branching out from an over-reliance on these traditional businesses, but we aren’t convinced that the choice to grow in consumer lending will prove successful.”</p><p>An investor at a large fund says he will not buy Goldman while it carries the “headline risk” of the 1MDB bribery and money-laundering scandal. Goldman is close to a $2bn deal with the US Department of Justice over its role in the alleged fraud and is negotiating with Malaysian authorities, which are seeking compensation after $4.5bn that was raised for them by Goldman was allegedly stolen.</p><p>Others are skeptical about Mr Solomon’s drive to turn Goldman’s old investing business into a private equity powerhouse like Blackstone by raising more funds from clients instead of being skewed towards investing Goldman’s own capital.</p><p>“It’s always been a merchant bank but Blackstone and all the private equity firms have crushed them,” says the investor. “The PE firms are the new Goldman Sachs . . . [while] Goldman Sachs is trying to be JPMorgan.”</p><p>Although dismissed as simplistic by some at the bank, such an assessment begs the question: What makes Goldman, Goldman?</p><p>Its partnership structure — where 415 of its most valuable staff earn $1m salaries and gain investment opportunities — sets it apart from other US banks. Executives insist the structure will remain even as Goldman evolves. But it is dominated by the traditional units: there are just three partners based in the consumer business.</p><p>The consumer business does not “need that many [partners]”, says one, adding that in investment banking “they make their revenue through the sweat and tears of people”, while in consumer banking “if someone is sitting in a call centre they’re not contributing in the same way”.</p><p>Internal Goldman statistics show that average partner tenure held steady at seven years but more than 30 partners left in 2019, including a string of high-profile departures in the final quarter.</p><p>“I don’t think many people feel like Goldman in its heyday and Goldman now are the same firm,” says a partner who left in 2018. “There was a lot of prestige to being a part of Goldman in the 1990s and in the 2000s, now with this consumer push [there isn’t].”</p><div></div>"

      "<p>Do you ever wake up in the morning feeling worried? Wondering what could go wrong? Depressed about your life? For years I woke up with some worry that I had been ruminating about in my sleep or in those half-conscious hours before I was completely awake.</p><p>Here is a practice I started several years ago that dissipated those worries.&nbsp; Each morning I take five minutes before rising to list all the things I am grateful for in my life: good health, my wife Penny, two sons with strong marriages to amazing women, four wonderful grandchildren, opportunities to work with great teachers and students at Harvard Business School, chances to help leaders become authentic and perform their best, and the potential to make a difference in the world.</p><p>I find that this simple practice energizes me for the day ahead. It enables me to approach each day with joy and a positive attitude, and keeps me from worrying about what could go wrong. Rather than thinking about the latter, I have adopted the philosophy that “I will cross that bridge when I come to it,” feeling confident that I can find a positive way through, even in the worst of circumstances. And I can also help others find positive approaches to the difficulties and challenges they face.</p><p>In the evening, prior to going to sleep at night, I also conclude the day with prayers of gratitude. These positive approaches are a response to my own life experiences – having faced the sudden deaths of loved ones, disappointments at work, rejection from others, and hearing the life stories of many people who have faced far greater challenges and difficulties than I have. The longer I live, the more I feel deeply blessed.</p><p>I have learned the hard way that life is not always fair, and that good things don’t always happen to good people. For example, in my mid-twenties I experienced the deaths of both my mother and my fiancée just eighteen months apart. As painful as these deaths were, they helped me to appreciate the impermanence of life and the need to cherish each day the time we have with our loved ones. As a result, I treasure the great love of my life, my wife Penny, and relish each minute we have together.</p><p>Simply acknowledging that unfair things and unexpected difficulties can happen at any time enables me to accept these things when they occur.&nbsp; This acceptance can then give way to learning from these experiences, a process in which pain is transformed into wisdom and ultimately serenity – qualities that have helped me to live a fuller life and do more to help others.</p><p>In my teens, I faced rejection after losing seven elections in a row. As an adult in my mid-forties, I lost my way in my career. When I look back, these hardships and disappointments laid a foundation for a more mature understanding of myself. They also enabled me to empathize with others facing difficulties.</p><p>I also recognize that the difficulties I may be facing at any point in my life pale by comparison with what others have gone through and how they emerged to achieve great things in the world. On our 50<sup>th</sup> anniversary trip in August, our whole family visited Robben Island off the coast of Cape Town where Nelson Mandela spent 27 years in a small jail cell for a crime he did not commit. In emerging from this terrible ordeal, he had the courage to transform South Africa into “a united, democratic and non-racial South Africa.” His example along with those of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., Mother Teresa, Mahatma Gandhi, Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy – along with modern day leaders like Oprah Winfrey, Merck’s Ken Frazier, PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi, and Unilever’s Paul Polman – shows that great accomplishments often result from challenges faced earlier in life. Ironically such challenges often create gratitude in leaders for the opportunities they do have, and they forge the moral force of character to pursue their beliefs in the face of opposition.</p><sup>th</sup><p>As you approach this Thanksgiving, take a few minutes to appreciate all the things in your life for which you can be grateful. Then, commit to yourself to use your gratitude and your opportunities to make this world a better place to live in. You will find that gratitude centers you. It also emboldens you to face any challenge with courage and perseverance.</p><div></div>"

      "<p><strong>You see the confetti&nbsp;</strong>before you see him: It swirls over the dance floor as a parade arrives in his honor—leotard-clad servers bearing a glow-in-the-dark bottle of Don Julio and a billboard that reads “D SOL.” It’s then, at half past midnight, at the LIV nightclub in the basement of Miami’s Fontainebleau hotel, that the chief executive of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/goldman-sachs-group/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Goldman Sachs</a>&nbsp;emerges, picks up a chunky pair of white headphones, and steps behind the turntables and into his disc jockey alter ego.</p><strong>You see the confetti&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/goldman-sachs-group/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Goldman Sachs</a><p>It’s the last Saturday in October, which means it’s Halloween in South Beach, and the club has been made over into an apocalyptic Area&nbsp;51; the crowd has shown up in a mix of extraterrestrial outfits along with devil horns, bunny ears, and Dracula capes. (When I arrived, I’d given David Solomon’s name at the door, eliciting nothing but a blank look from the bouncer. “D-Sol?” He nodded and opened the velvet rope.) Solomon, brow furrowed, looks comparatively sober in a black T-shirt, white pants, and pink Converse low-top Chuck Taylors. Behind him in the DJ booth, a couple of women appear to be dressed as the poo emoji, a costume they’ve accessorized with rolls of toilet paper and a plunger. For the next hour, Solomon will entertain the revelers, occasionally pumping his fist as he mixes rock guitar riffs from Guns N’ Roses and the White Stripes with 1990s hip-hop and wait-for-the-drop dance beats. You can feel the bass pulse through your rib cage, punctuated by blasts from cryogenic fog cannons and strobing lasers. Solomon bops along, his hands on the knobs. Then he drops a Bingo Players ditty whose lyrics consist primarily of the cheeky refrain, “Everybody wants to know how little I care, how little I care.”</p><p>It’s hard not to interpret it as a droll retort to anyone who would question whether the CEO of Wall Street’s most storied institution—who sipped tequila at the club until almost 3 a.m.—belongs in such a hotspot while the rest of the Goldman Sachs board is presumably asleep. Solomon was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/business/dealbook/goldman-sachs-david-solomon-dj-d-sol.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">outed as DJ D-Sol</a>&nbsp;by the&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;in 2017, when he was still one of two copresidents gunning for the top job at the firm. Known at the office as an über-professional, hard-charging manager with little patience for small talk, Solomon was anxious that people would no longer take him seriously—mistakenly equating the side gig with some sort of midlife crisis. Some advisers told him to hang it up. “I thought for a minute, Well, can I do this, can I not do this?” recalls Solomon, who donates the proceeds from his gigs and Spotify plays to drug-addiction-related philanthropies. (He says the total he has raised is in the six figures.) Those doubts soon dispersed, especially after his boss at the time, then-CEO Lloyd Blankfein, and others endorsed it. “You know what, it’s who I am, and nobody would tell me not to play golf,” Solomon says now. “And why shouldn’t I—because I’m a CEO?”</p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/13/business/dealbook/goldman-sachs-david-solomon-dj-d-sol.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">outed as DJ D-Sol</a><em>New York Times</em><p>Solomon’s irreverence, even disdain, for The Way Things Have Always Been Done, feather-ruffling and polarizing though it may be for the bank’s old-timers, is also the defining quality that has put him atop the venerable Goldman Sachs. Shortly after his first anniversary as CEO in October, the bank celebrated its 150th birthday; it’s the oldest of the big Wall Street banks to still operate under its original name. At a billionaire-­studded cocktail party in New York to commemorate the occasion, Solomon, with a shade of self-deprecation, praised the firm’s tradition of leaders who were “always, up to this point, the right people at the right time.”</p><p>His time is shaping up to be one characterized by historic transformation, as Wall Street undergoes an unprecedented technological revolution—and Goldman, in the view of some analysts, may undergo greater change than any other big bank. It comes on the heels of Blankfein’s dozen-year tenure, which started in glory and ended in unprecedented uncertainty. In the years leading up to the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs made astronomical returns on the back of high-risk trades—then reversed some of those bets sooner than others did, riding out the crash on top of Wall Street. Goldman turned a profit in 2008, then racked up record-high earnings in 2009. That rainmaking afforded its leaders a certain leeway with shareholders. So long as they delivered the returns, investors tolerated their opaque financial disclosures and lavish expenditures on pay and perks. “They were really the kings and queens of Wall Street, they did so well,” says Mike Mayo, a bank analyst with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/wells-fargo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wells Fargo</a>.</p><a href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/wells-fargo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Wells Fargo</a><p>But the decade since has been a different story. Financial regulation and the rise of electronic trading have dampened profits. Market-making in assets like bonds and commodities, once Goldman’s bread and butter, has turned to crumbs now that it is largely automated—representing 37% of the firm’s net revenues in 2018, down from 72% in ’09. (That drop has come even though Goldman now commands a bigger share of trading in those industries.) And because Goldman’s old ways worked so well for so long, it never went through the postrecession reckoning its rivals did. “Goldman Sachs was a victim of its own success,” Mayo says. “They didn’t feel the same need to evolve as their underperforming peers.”</p><p>Now Goldman is the one underperforming. Though it’s still No.&nbsp;1 in mergers and acquisitions and IPO dealmaking, its revenue has declined 6% since 2010, to $36.6&nbsp;billion in 2018, and is on track to decline further this year. Its stock has lagged both the financial sector and the S&amp;P&nbsp;500 over the past five years—yielding the worst returns of any major U.S. bank. It is also facing its biggest reputational crisis since the backlash against its too-big-to-fail bailout famously led to its caricature as a “vampire squid.” Two former Goldman Sachs executives have been indicted for conspiring in a multibillion-dollar theft from the Malaysian investment fund known as 1MDB, a scandal that could cost Goldman as much as $5&nbsp;billion to settle.</p><p>Enter David Solomon. At six-feet-two, he stands—literally, in the same office where Blankfein used to sit—a full head taller than his predecessor. A broad-shouldered and imposing figure, Solomon has an aggressive, at times combative style that forgoes Blankfein’s characteristic humor in favor of blunt straight talk and a willingness to rethink Goldman conventions Blankfein wouldn’t touch.</p><p>He’ll need those qualities for the tasks ahead. Solomon is acutely aware he needs to jump-start Goldman’s revenue growth by forging into new businesses the firm had previously overlooked (from large-scale quant trading and managing corporate payments to being banker to less wealthy consumers and doing deals with smaller companies). He also needs to squeeze more efficiency from the firm—and that may mean people will have to work harder to earn the paychecks that have made Goldman’s upper echelons enormously wealthy while luring bright young financial sharks to the firm’s talent pool. “I don’t have any sense that he’s a status quo kind of guy, which I give as a compliment,” says Steve Friedman, who was once CEO of Goldman Sachs and now serves as chairman of Stone Point Capital, a private equity firm.</p><p>When Solomon became CEO, Friedman advised him to preserve a “small core” of cultural values, but that “everything else has to be subject to change.” Solomon has led by that creed. In March, he tore up the firm’s age-old dress code, a 35-page dossier with outdated stipulations about suits, ties, and shoe color. And this summer, Goldman quietly eliminated drug testing from its employee background checks. Gone, too, is the blanket ban on taking photos inside the office, once enforced by building security guards; Solomon now frequently posts such pics to his Instagram account. “The organization has a lot of bureaucracy I’d like to simplify,” says Solomon (though he doesn’t take credit for changing the drug or photo policies). “I think we can do some work to be more admired and respected, and a little less envied and feared.”</p><p>Short of knocking down walls, he’s trying to dispel the ivory-tower reputation that Goldman has cultivated through a historically secretive and hierarchical culture. On the mahogany-lined executive floor, Solomon chafes when visiting colleagues are asked to sit in the waiting room; he insists they be allowed to bypass two layers of receptionists and knock directly on his door. He prefers getting his own coffee and showing up unannounced at divisional meetings, and rejects prepared talking points. “He hates any sort of idea of Praetorian Guard, by any name,” says John F.W. Rogers, the firm’s chief of staff. At a firm that has for decades primarily communicated with its 38,000 employees via mass voicemail, Solomon asked his staff to find a way to convene a global all-hands Silicon Valley–style town hall in Goldman headquarters’ 11th-floor “sky lobby” (between the elevator banks and the cafeteria) so that he can hold them impromptu. (The company abandoned the idea after the logistics of coordinating its 73 offices proved too difficult and costly.)</p><p>To certain board members’ horror, Solomon, who made $23&nbsp;million last year, habitually chooses to travel around New York City by subway. “I mean, why wouldn’t you take the subway? No, seriously,” he says. “It’s quicker and more efficient. You know, the mayor of New York can take the subway. Why can’t the CEO of Goldman Sachs?”</p><p>Goldman Sachs, once a private partnership, has been a public company for 20 years. Solomon has been saying he wants at long last to run it more like one. Whereas Blankfein never dialed in to the firm’s quarterly earnings calls, Solomon doesn’t plan to miss any. At its investor day on Jan.&nbsp;29, Goldman Sachs will welcome some 300 shareholders, analysts, and regulators inside its Manhattan headquarters for the first time and unveil Solomon’s new innovation: a three- to five-year strategic plan. That may seem unremarkable, but until now the firm, believing the market too unpredictable, had only ever budgeted through each calendar year. “The way we made investments is we’d rub sticks together, we’d sprinkle a little bit on something,” says Solomon. In other words, each year Goldman’s people had to find a way to bring in more money than the last, but anything that required a longer-term commitment of resources to pay off later was off the table. “You don’t just get to run faster, jump higher, and have more profit just because we’re Goldman Sachs,” says COO John Waldron, reinforcing the focus on investing. “You’ve got to put money in the ground that grows over time.”</p><p>It all adds up to a pivotal moment for Goldman Sachs, and Solomon will help determine whether the firm leads again or fades out of relevance. As someone who was seldom in the press before the DJ&nbsp;D-Sol revelations, he’s still adjusting to the spotlight that comes with his powerful role; in interviews this fall, Solomon described a personal struggle to “live my life in a normal way.” His collaborators say that kind of practical, unpretentious mentality may be just what the bank needs now. “I think he’s doing the right things to evolve Goldman Sachs to compete in the 21st century,” says Michael Dell, whose company Dell Technologies has been a Goldman client longer than Solomon has worked there (and whose brother’s startup, Clarity Money, was acquired by Goldman last year). “Supertankers don’t just turn.”</p><p data-inc=\"3\"><strong>Solomon became CEO,</strong>&nbsp;in October 2018, at a tumultuous time not only for the firm but in his own life. He’d recently finalized his divorce. His second week in the job, his former assistant, who’d been charged with stealing $1.2&nbsp;million worth of wine from Solomon’s collection, jumped to his death from a Manhattan hotel window. Solomon’s two twentysomething daughters, with whom he’d long had a standing Sunday night dinner date in New York, had both moved across the country that summer. His father had passed away in his seventies a couple of years earlier. “I think he wishes his parents had been alive to see him become CEO of Goldman Sachs,” says a friend who’s known Solomon since his undergraduate years at Hamilton College. “I think that would have been incredibly meaningful to him.”</p><strong>Solomon became CEO,</strong><p>The 57-year-old Solomon found himself at the zenith of his career, single and no longer tethered to many of his former responsibilities—outside the small task of running Goldman Sachs. “If I’m not working, I can basically do whatever I want,” he says. “And as a personality, if I decide I’m interested in something and I’m going to do it, I’m going to do it. I mean, I’m going to try to really do it to the highest capacity of my ability, or I’m not going to do it.” He’s applied that intensity to hobbies like DJing and kite-surfing—some colleagues have termed him a “born-again millennial.”</p><p>He’s also applied it at the bank, where Solomon has always been something of an outlier. Competing with Harvey Schwartz for the top job—beginning in late 2016, when they were both named copresidents—Solomon was seen as the underdog. He was an investment banker; both his rival and boss Blankfein were traders. Among peers, he also bore the brand of a “lateral”—he had been hired from Bear Stearns as a partner in 1999, instead of working his way up to the title from within.</p><p>Above all Solomon, who’d once worked at McDonald’s and been rejected the first two times he applied to Goldman, was a jarring force in the firm’s tirelessly collegial atmosphere. Coming from elsewhere on the Street, another transplant notes, Goldman could “feel like you walked into&nbsp;<em>Pleasantville</em>.” In the firm’s consensus-driven culture, Solomon was a strong-willed, table-pounding decision-maker. He would tell employees to their face when they had no shot of making partner that year, and openly challenge colleagues’ ideas in meetings of 25 other people. “The first couple conversations were a little brutal, but people then appreciate it—there’s no BS,” says Gregg Lemkau, who has Solomon’s former job as cohead of investment banking. If you need someone to tell you you did a good job, Lemkau advised a colleague, “Go hire somebody to do that for you.”</p><em>Pleasantville</em><p>Still, Solomon had enough emotional intelligence to navigate the firm’s politics and temper his tone accordingly, and he impressed his superiors with his ability to nurture and groom underlings. “He’d probably be pissed at me for saying this,” says Chris Nassetta, Hilton’s CEO and Solomon’s close friend, “but I think a lot of people don’t know that David is a sweetheart of a guy.”</p><p data-inc=\"4\">Solomon doesn’t emphasize that side as he fosters a more rigid tone of accountability. Underpinning the strategy Solomon is bringing to Goldman Sachs now is a stricter lens for performance evaluation—a metrics-based system that he piloted in the decade he ran the investment banking division. There, he’d receive statistical reports on such factors that reflected priorities both traditional—such as the fees each banker collected—and personal, like which ones violated his rule against making junior analysts work on Saturdays. In year-end reviews, he surprised some people by asking them to justify granular choices. A fiscal disciplinarian, he unseated some managers whose pay ballooned out of whack and replaced them with cheaper people; besides layoffs, past employees say getting “zeroed” at bonus season was a signal to start job-hunting. At the same time, he demanded loyalty, dismissing young analysts who were caught accepting their next job elsewhere before their Goldman contract was up. Solomon felt it was a conflict of interest. Of his philosophy, he says, “You have to set a culture where discipline matters, and people make hard decisions.”</p><p>The ultimate manifestation of Solomon’s method is the way he set out to tackle Goldman’s gender gap. Concluding that the problem began at the bottom, Solomon instructed his investment bankers to hire half-female analyst classes starting in 2017, then expanded the mandate to all new recruits. Bankers received no bonus points when they increased the share of women from roughly 40% to as much as 49%. “Like, doing almost well enough doesn’t count,” Lemkau recalls. “That is quintessential David.” The banking division’s analysts that started this year are the firm’s first to achieve gender parity; firm-wide, Goldman expects its 2020 crop to include more women than men. “He is really breaking glass,” Dina Powell, a Goldman partner and former White House adviser, said at&nbsp;<em>Fortune</em>’s Most Powerful Women Summit in October.</p><em>Fortune</em><p>Indeed, several colleagues use the phrase “breaking glass” to describe Solomon’s approach—often in the sense of someone who set upon Goldman’s old ways as though he was rifling through Grandma’s antiques to decide what to pawn and what to toss. His first day as CEO, he put out a memo aimed at bulldozing the territorial silos in which the firm was organized: Now, there’d be just “One Goldman Sachs,” Solomon wrote. People would be compensated more for bringing in business anywhere in the firm, regardless of where they sat. Within minutes of the email hitting inboxes, says Alison Mass, chairman of the investment banking division, she had “50 calls from random people around the firm,” including back-office workers, with ideas to sell her clients. “It was literally like he turned a key and unlocked a door and let everyone out,” Mass says.</p><p>Next, Solomon turned Goldman’s investment banking playbook on itself, running the kind of front-to-back review it has done for innumerable clients. He asked his lieutenants to strip their businesses “down to the studs,” asking as many as 40 questions in the span of a 90-minute meeting. “He doesn’t ask a question rhetorically,” notes CFO Stephen Scherr. Solomon’s edict: “There are no sacred cows.” That included the securities division, where Blankfein, a trader by background, had resisted changes; so far, Solomon has green-lit more automated trading and the consolidation of back-end operations, which is expected to shave off some jobs. He also merged Goldman’s high-net-worth and consumer businesses, with the aim of serving both sets of customers with a single web platform. “There are very few leaders in the financial services business who are very detail-oriented and at the same time strategic,” says Alan Schwartz, once Solomon’s boss at Bear Stearns, now Guggenheim Partners’ executive chairman. “David is one of those who does both.”</p><p>The proverbial bovine sacrifice should help Goldman improve returns as it spends to scale up its technology ($1.3&nbsp;billion on the consumer business alone, so far). But it also means fewer luxury perks for employees. Some senior bankers lament having to fly coach on trips where in the good old days they sat in business class; Goldman now discourages anyone but partners from gliding into the line of black cars waiting outside the bank’s New York headquarters to get to meetings, telling them to take Uber instead. Solomon says expense policy decisions are too small-potato to involve him directly, but they reflect an increasing rigor toward expenses and productivity. “When we say ‘operating efficiency,’ everyone hears cost—operating efficiency, you’re a cost,” says Stephanie Cohen, the firm’s chief strategy officer. “What we’re really trying to do is help people do their job more efficiently, and sometimes that’s a cost thing, sometimes it’s a time thing.”</p><p data-inc=\"5\"><strong>Since Goldman Sachs</strong>&nbsp;launched its first credit card, in partnership with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/apple/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple</a>, over the summer, Solomon has been workshopping a new party trick. It starts with the phrase, “Take out your phone.” In a two-minute routine requiring a few swipes and the last four digits of your Social Security number, Solomon has been virtually opening Apple Card accounts for many of his friends and acquaintances. “It’s pretty easy, right?” he says, adding, “It’s not perfect.”</p><strong>Since Goldman Sachs</strong><a href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/apple/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple</a><p>The Apple Card—tailor-made for the iPhone’s mobile wallet, with a numberless titanium physical counterpart—was a partnership that grew out of Marcus, the fledgling consumer bank within Goldman Sachs that made its debut in 2016. The card was code-named “Project Cookie” inside the bank; Apple itself was known as “Saturn”—perhaps because Goldman, as one of its partners, was treated like one of many moons in its orbit. Goldman’s logo, along with Mastercard’s, ended up on the back of the white metal rectangle (and is nowhere to be seen on the virtual version).</p><p>The credit card’s development has been a telling parable about a bank exploring a new business a century and a half into its existence, and at times finding itself out of its league. Goldman until recently never fancied itself a retail banker, even after a financial-­crisis era change to its regulatory status allowed it to become one. “I think we were in denial,” says Lemkau. But as its revenue has steadily shrunk, it has had to come to terms with trying something new. Goldman is targeting $5&nbsp;billion in annual revenue from new businesses by the end of 2020, with Marcus on track to generate more than $1&nbsp;billion.</p><p>Neither Solomon nor Goldman likes doing anything unless they can excel, and the firm determined it should be able to start a consumer tech business at least as well as any garage-full of entrepreneurs in San Francisco. Three years after launching Marcus, though, it has encountered many of the problems of a startup without engendering quite the same cultural feel. Between a patchwork of acquisitions—including its $750 million purchase of financial-adviser network United Capital this year, the firm’s largest in nearly two decades—and engineers both in-house and outsourced to three of the “Big Four” consulting firms simultaneously, former Marcus employees describe a Babel-like experience. Engineers chafed at the way Goldman computers require running compliance systems that restrict their functions, and dubbed them “Kushners”—a reference to the way presidential son-in-law Jared famously runs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;Windows on a Mac. Without its own consumer data to back-test, Goldman initially took higher losses on Marcus loans than it planned. The Apple Card rollout has also been glitchy; New York regulators have opened an investigation into whether Goldman’s credit limit algorithm has a sexist bias, which the bank denies. For all that, Marcus still doesn’t have a mobile app—though people close to the bank say it’s coming soon.</p><a href=\"https://fortune.com/fortune500/microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Microsoft</a><p>What it does have is scale—$55&nbsp;billion in deposits and $5&nbsp;billion in loans, dwarfing most fintech startups. “When you take risks, you make mistakes, you lose money, things go wrong,” Solomon says. “The only difference is we don’t stand up there and trumpet publicly in an amplifier, ‘Go fast and break things.’ ”</p><p>Solomon’s keen anticipation of “what possibly could go wrong” is a major reason he was chosen to be CEO, says Bill George, a Harvard Business School professor who retired this year from Goldman’s board. “You know how they talk about professional basketball players having eyes in the back of their head? He had that kind of peripheral vision.”</p><p><strong>There was long</strong>&nbsp;a phrase inside Goldman Sachs to describe those most likely to ascend the firm’s coveted partner track:&nbsp;<em>an economic killer</em>. “It used to be the only thing that mattered,” says an ex–managing director. And en route to the top, you ate what you killed: Bonuses were paid virtually entirely according to the revenue you made for the firm that year.</p><strong>There was long</strong><em>an economic killer</em><p>As Solomon seeks to spur the firm to work more cooperatively, he and his leadership team are recalibrating how Goldman pays its people—by far the firm’s biggest expense, accounting for about 35% of revenue this year. And that means redefining who’s a killer. Around holiday time, when this year’s compensation discussions begin, a new rubric will tie bonuses more to the company’s new priorities, including three-year timeline goals, diverse hiring, participating in the “One Goldman Sachs” spirit—and the overall returns of the firm. The system effectively puts more of employees’ compensation out of their own control and potentially at risk—especially as some grow more convinced that the bull market is poised to top out soon. “I don’t think realistically there’s a tremendous amount of upside in the future,” says a recently departed partner. “I don’t think it will ever be what it used to be.”</p><p>Neither Solomon nor his C-suite have explicitly professed an intention to give paychecks a haircut. But the compensation pool they earmarked for the first nine months of 2019 is 11% lower than it was for that period last year, a steeper drop than the 7% decline in revenue. Employees anticipate a flattening phenomenon: “$1&nbsp;million is the new $3&nbsp;million,” says the former managing director, adding that this year’s norm for pay for the so-called MD tier—one rung below partner—may be closer to $750,000, including bonus.</p><p>That trend could be cause or effect—or both—of a recent exodus of partners. About 10% of them have announced their departures since Solomon took over, and more could leave by the end of the year. The “thinning out,” as COO Waldron calls it, has created an opening into which the firm is actively promoting a younger, forward-thinking generation of executives. Solomon says his only intention is “that young people get to move up, and people that have been here for a while don’t stay too long.”</p><p data-inc=\"7\">That’s made Solomon popular with the millennial and Gen&nbsp;Z cohorts who now make up 75% of Goldman Sachs’s workforce—and there’s a mood among them that Solomon is the change the bank has been waiting for. At the same time, he aims to make the culmination of their Goldman Sachs career—the partnership—just that much harder to attain, by paring partner ranks even further toward 400, from about 440 or so today. It also makes sense when you consider that the partnership ranks grew by some 63% over Blankfein’s tenure, even as revenue stagnated. Partnership remains the firm’s holy grail, and the reason employees at lower levels have long been willing to accept the “Goldman discount” compared with other Wall Street salaries—in exchange for the chance to eventually make far more. The message, Solomon says, is, “If you really succeed here, the top of the pyramid is super-aspirational.”</p><p>The tradeoff is that for most, Goldman Sachs may have fewer of the trappings of a haven for the elite. “I don’t want to make Goldman Sachs more exclusive. In fact the opposite,” says Solomon. “I’m trying to make it more open, more approachable, more understood, more human.” After all, many younger Goldmanites remember neither the boom times nor bailout days; to them, nothing symbolizes the bank more than a selfie at the club with D-Sol.</p><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon/\">Fortune.com</a> on 11/14/2019.</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon/\">Fortune.com</a> on 11/14/2019.</em><a href=\"https://fortune.com/longform/goldman-sachs-ceo-david-solomon/\">Fortune.com</a><div></div>"

      "<p>The George family name has been linked symbiotically to the growth of integrative health and medicine in the United States for 20 years.

The model is dispersive. While the new Center will likely be located in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dahlc.mayoclinic.org/\">Dan Abraham Center for Healthy Living,</a>&nbsp;it’s not locked into a physical space but rather is meant to partner and spread through any Mayo program where women’s health is involved. The Georges hope the initiative will eventually draw at least $50-million to the Center.</p><a href=\"https://dahlc.mayoclinic.org/\">Dan Abraham Center for Healthy Living,</a><p>When I asked Penny George why they chose this direction, she responded with passion for righting patterns of historic disservice. She referenced the time in health care were healers were predominantly women. She noted the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/126/6/1055.full.pdf\">destructive influence of the 1910 Flexner report</a>&nbsp;in shutting medical schools that were a woman’s route to practice. The diminution of women reached into science: “Even in major research studies, they often had no women at all as subjects.”</p><a href=\"https://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/126/6/1055.full.pdf\">destructive influence of the 1910 Flexner report</a><p>The investment was based on a strategy in George family giving on which&nbsp;<em>Inside Philanthropy</em>&nbsp;focused: invest in proven leaders.

The center’s goal is to become a destination for women’s health care where patients are not only treated for a specific condition, but also empowered with the tools and knowledge they need to improve their overall health and wellness: mind, body and spirit.”</p><p>George notes that although Faubion does not come from the integrative world, the whole person, integrative philosophy will be central to the experience of those served through the Center. From the perspective of Mayo’s delivery and business model, the Center is more of a sibling entity to the world-renown&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-executive-health-program/sections/overview/ovc-20253196\">executive health center</a>&nbsp;than to its integrative medicine center. “I think [Mayo] is hoping that more people will be coming to have their whole person care looked at, coming for health optimization.” George anticipates that Faubion will be connecting with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/bauer-brent-a-m-d/bio-00077560\">Brent Bauer, MD</a>&nbsp;and his integrative medicine team in the effort to river the initiative into other aspects of Mayo service delivery. The media release makes clear that integrative principles are deeply embedded:</p><a href=\"https://www.mayoclinic.org/departments-centers/mayo-clinic-executive-health-program/sections/overview/ovc-20253196\">executive health center</a><a href=\"https://www.mayo.edu/research/faculty/bauer-brent-a-m-d/bio-00077560\">Brent Bauer, MD</a><blockquote><p>The Center for Women’s Health seeks to empower women to prioritize their care and provide them with the options and solutions they need to improve their well-being based on their health needs, genetic traits, lifestyle and personal preferences.

They can take advantage of additional appointments or consultations in areas of women’s health to help them stay healthy or to treat their medical conditions.</p>\n<p>The multidisciplinary center also will work with other divisions and departments at Mayo Clinic to incorporate integrative health and lifestyle services into their models of care.

    "post_date": "July 8, 2019",
    "post_content": [
      "<p>In working with many authentic leaders, I have learned that the three keys to becoming a True North Leader are Truth, Transparency and Trust. All three are essential qualities for building authentic relationships with your colleagues and teammates.</p><p>Do you want to become a True North Leader? First, you must discover your True North. When you do, you can practice the 3 T’s of True North Leaders: Truth, Transparency and Trust. These three practices of leaders enable you to build authentic relationships with people you lead and work with to enable your team to discover its True North and make it a reality.</p><p><u>Truth</u></p><u>Truth</u><p>Of all the qualities needed to be a True North Leader, the one indispensable value is integrity – or telling the truth. Unless you tell the whole truth to people, you will be unable to establish authentic relationships with your teammates. Organizations simply cannot function without integrity and a common knowledge of the truth; lacking it, they will devolve into political jungles where charisma takes precedence over character – a guaranteed route to failure.</p><p>Whereas politicians may get away with shading the truth and even outright lies, business leaders cannot. In the end their words will catch up with them, and they will lose legitimacy in the eyes of the people they work with. Contrary to the current political rhetoric, there is no such thing as “alternative facts.” There is only one set of facts that will lead us to the truth.</p><p>I once said to a close Medtronic colleague that “integrity is not the absence of lying.” I knew he would never lie to me, but I also observed that he tended to tell me only the good parts of a story, especially when it involved bad news. I urged him to tell me the whole story – the good, the bad and the ugly – and promised him he would never be punished for being a messenger of bad news.</p><p>Authentic leaders need to surround themselves with “truth tellers” – subordinates who have the courage to tell them the truth, especially when it hurts. Jamie Dimon, CEO of J.P. Morgan, tells the story of a subordinate who asked him, “Shouldn’t you have at least one truth teller on your team?” To which he replied, “If only one person on the team will tell me the truth, then I should fire the other nine. Everyone must be a truth teller.”</p><p>Ask yourself, would you follow someone who doesn’t tell the truth? Would you be willing to bet your career on them? I certainly wouldn’t. Nor should you.</p><p><u>Transparency</u></p><u>Transparency</u><p>How transparent are you with your colleagues? How much do you share with them?</p><p>In the days of 20<sup>th</sup> century hierarchical leaders, it was common for leaders to hoard information at the top of organizations. These leaders shared with their subordinates only what they had “a need to know.” Thus, many people had no idea what was going on at the higher levels of the company.</p><sup>th</sup><p>Anne Mulcahy became chief operating officer of Xerox in 2000, as the company was struggling to avoid bankruptcy. She commented: “When I took over as COO, I was amazed at just how unaware everyone was of the seriousness of the issues. No one understood, and I mean no one.&nbsp; It was shocking for the Xerox executive team to find out how dismal the outlook was.”</p><p>All this has changed for today’s leaders. They operate in a collaborative mode wherein horizontal relationships are more important than vertical ones to get things done. In order for everyone to do their jobs most effectively, authentic leaders share the complete picture with their colleagues.</p><p>Many leaders fear sharing bad news with their bosses and their peers, and even their subordinates. If they do not, how can they expect people to address problems unless they understand the full picture? At Medtronic, I told our team, “You need to surface bad news immediately, rather than waiting until we have the whole picture or solutions to rectify it. Then we can assign the best people in the company to understand its root cause and devise corrective actions.” This led to some uneasy phone calls late in the evening and on weekends, but it was far better to know the challenges so we could assign the proper resources to work on them.</p><p>The most successful organizations I have seen specialize in transparency because with it, everyone is able to operate more effectively.</p><p><u>Trust</u></p><u>Trust</u><p>For business leaders, trust is the coin of the realm. An essential part of any leaders’ job is to build the trust of their customers in the quality of their products, their services, their truthfulness as they build trusted brands. Due to the failure of their leaders to establish trust, three famous brands – Facebook, GE, and Wells Fargo – were badly tarnished and will take at least a decade to recover.</p><p>It is equally important for leaders to build the trust of their employees. To do so, they must always tell them the truth, be transparent in sharing information with them, both good and bad, and be available in person to share with them. When faced with Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook’s Zuckerberg went into hiding for five days, a sharp contrast to his frequent public appearances. On the fourth day he had a regular town hall forum scheduled with all employees, an event that he had attended regularly with chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg. But on this day, he skipped the meeting and instead sent Facebook’s deputy general counsel to answer employees’ questions. What was the message that sent? This was a purely legal matter. Zuckerberg was unwilling to face the real issue, which was whether Facebook’s two billion users could trust the company not to sell their personal information.</p><p>Contrast Zuckerberg’s withdrawal with Best Buy CEO Hubert Joly. When he became CEO in 2012, Joly faced a broken company whose 125,000 employees questioned whether the company could compete with on-line retailer Amazon. Joly immediately went into the stores, wearing Best Buy’s signature blue shirt, not just to visit, but to talk with customers and help sell its products. Then he made an extremely bold move: he committed to match any price a customer could find on-line with Best Buy’s in-store price. That cost the company some margin, but it led to a transformation in the trust of both Best Buy’s customers and employees.</p><p>As we can learn from these examples, trust is created not by words alone, but by the leaders’ actions. In crises like these, leaders must be fully present and willing to address the most difficult issues its customers and employees as well as its investors and the media may raise. As Woody Allen once said, “Eighty per cent of success is showing up.” As a leader if you don’t show up at crucial times, no one will trust you.</p><p>As you strive to improve as a True North Leader, work carefully on developing these three qualities: telling the whole <em>truth</em>, being fully <em>transparent</em> with your teammates, and building <em>trust</em> with all your constituencies.&nbsp; As you do so, your reputation as a leader will grow stronger and you will gain credibility with your teammates.</p><em>truth</em><em>transparent</em><em>trust</em><p>—</p><p>To learn more about how to develop these qualities of True North Leaders, please read my book, <em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Discover-Your-True-North-George/dp/1119082943/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=discover+your+true+north&amp;qid=1562588202&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1\">Discover Your True North</a>.</em></p><em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Discover-Your-True-North-George/dp/1119082943/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=discover+your+true+north&amp;qid=1562588202&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1\">Discover Your True North</a>.</em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Discover-Your-True-North-George/dp/1119082943/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=discover+your+true+north&amp;qid=1562588202&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-1-spons&amp;psc=1\">Discover Your True North</a><div></div>"

There are cancer centers, cardiovascular centers, OBGYN centers, but none fully committed to women’s comprehensive health,” said Bill George, a Mayo Clinic trustee.</p>\n<div class=\"subscriber-only\">\n<p>“I have served on the Mayo board for the last seven years,” he said. “One of the things I’ve observed all across the country, hospitals are not really giving sufficient … broad-based care for all of women’s health care. We think it has been an area of neglect.”</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"subscriber-only\">\n<p>The multidisciplinary center works with other departments at Mayo Clinic “to incorporate integrative health and lifestyle services into their models of care,” according to Mayo Clinic press release. “In addition, the center will promote further research and education on how sex and gender affect health.”</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"subscriber-only\">\n<p>The Georges attributed much of this idea for better addressing women’s health across all three of Mayo Clinic’s “shields” — clinical care, research and education — to Dr. Faubion’s vision of personalizing the health care experience of women.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"subscriber-only\">\n<p>“Over the last 100 years, women have not been well served by medicine, not well served clinically and not well served with research. Mayo is very committed to looking at women uniquely,” Penny George said Wednesday. “When Mayo gets behind something, they deliver on it.”</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"subscriber-only\">\n<p>The virtual center is already seeing patients as part of a pilot program with the goal of introducing it to the Rochester campus later this year.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"subscriber-only\">\n<p>“The Center for Women’s Health will lead by example to set a new national standard for women’s health care, providing personalized care that considers women as partners in their health care. The center’s goal is to become a destination for women’s health care where patients are not only treated for a specific condition, but also empowered with the tools and knowledge they need to improve their overall health and wellness: mind, body and spirit,” Faubion, the center’s director, said in the announcement.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"subscriber-only\">\n<p>The Georges said they hope this concept will catch on. They would like to see it spread to all of Mayo Clinic’s clinical sites as well in the research labs and classrooms.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"subscriber-only\">\n<p>“We hope that our gift is a drop in a bucket. There are so many opportunities to make a difference here. We believe that this an idea that’s time has come. We believe Mayo is primed to deliver on it,” Penny George said.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"subscriber-only\">\n<p>The center builds on the work of the past two decades done by Penny George and the George Family Foundation to advance the concept of integrative health through the Penny George Institute for Health and Healing at Allina Health and underwriting programs through the Catalyst Initiative.

      "<p>For the past two years the U.S. and other leading economies have engaged in a series of trade wars with no end in sight, and with populists gaining popularity around the world, national issues are increasingly taking precedence over the benefits of globalization.</p><p>During a trip to China last week where I was teaching a leadership course to a group of Chinese executives, I became even more aware of the depth of the differences between the world’s two largest economies. And while the world eagerly awaits the meeting between President Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping at this week’s G20 conclave in Osaka, Japan, with hopes that these leaders can settle their differences, a resolution is highly unlikely. The issues are simply too complex and far-reaching. Far more likely is a goodwill statement with commitments to restart negotiations. Meanwhile, Chinese businesses are moving ahead more aggressively with plans for global expansion, as they build diverse trading relationships around the globe.</p><p>The Trump-initiated tariff wars with China, Mexico, Canada, and Europe began as a way to correct trade imbalances between the U.S. and the rest of the world. Now these trade disputes are escalating into a full-scale trade war that will be hard to stop. If this happens, tariffs and bilateral negotiations will become the norm, supplanting global efforts to eliminate tariffs through multilateral agreements, and trigger the end of the free trade era that began after World War II.</p><p>This isn’t the first time the U. S. has engaged in trade wars. Following the stock market crash of 1929, political fervor over the loss of jobs to imports led to the passage of the disastrous&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Smoot-Hawley-Tariff-Act\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act</a>&nbsp;of 1930. It raised tariffs on 20,000 imported goods and led to retaliatory tariffs from many of America’s trading partners. The bill was intended to reduce the 8% unemployment rate, but just the opposite happened: unemployment&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1960/compendia/hist_stats_colonial-1957.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jumped</a>&nbsp;to 16% in 1931 and 25% by 1933.</p><a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Smoot-Hawley-Tariff-Act\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act</a><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1960/compendia/hist_stats_colonial-1957.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">jumped</a><p>After World War II, the U.S. took an entirely different tack, working with the European nations to open up trade and eliminate tariffs. On October 30, 1947, 30 nations signed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/agrmntseries2_gatt_e.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT)</a>. The U.S. passed the Marshall Plan that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/marshall-plan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">invested $12 billion</a>&nbsp;(nearly $100 billion in 2018) to rebuild the war-torn economies of Western Europe, leading to Germany’s resurgence as a global economic power. A similar American initiative enabled Japan’s great industries to rebound.</p><a href=\"https://www.wto.org/english/res_e/booksp_e/agrmntseries2_gatt_e.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT)</a><a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1945-1952/marshall-plan\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">invested $12 billion</a><p>In 1950, Frenchman Jean Monnet had the vision of replacing centuries of wars between Germany and France with a trade coalition that benefited and strengthened Europe’s position in the world. In 1958 European government leaders came together to form the European Economic Community, which became the European Community in 1967, and the European Union in 1993. In 1993 the U.S., Mexico and Canada formed NAFTA to compete with Asian and European nations. The following year, 123 nations created the World Trade Organization (WTO) as a comprehensive successor to GATT.</p><p>These trade agreements fueled the era of globalization and free trade, propelling a prolonged economic boom throughout the world, the rise of the Asian middle class, and the lifting of one billion people out of poverty.</p><p>Then came the 2008 financial crisis and a massive recession which spread globally. In spite of extreme efforts by governments to backstop banks and restore financial markets, the recession created double digit unemployment.</p><p>As a consequence, employees who had devoted their working lives to a single company found themselves out of work, with few resources to sustain them. Many U.S. factories closed, unable to compete with Mexican and Asian producers, putting millions more out of work. Even worse, they learned they were not qualified for new jobs as automation and technology made their skills obsolete. Unable to find meaningful jobs, many people simply dropped out of the workforce. Meanwhile, U.S. government leaders and companies failed to create retraining programs to bring these unemployed workers back to productive lives.</p><p>In spite of the economic rebound since 2010, a large swath of unemployed, disempowered workers have been left behind. Those who had jobs experienced no real wage growth as the wealthy reaped all the benefits of the recovery. Angry workers blamed immigrants and globalization for their problems, and supported nationalist movements in the U.S. and U.K., as well as France, Germany, Poland, Italy, Austria, Venezuela, and Brazil.</p><p>Meanwhile, the great global institutions formed after World War II are becoming ineffective and need to be revamped for today’s world. Without effective global leaders with the political clout to push reform these institutions will likely continue to lose impact and relevance.</p><p>Meanwhile, leaders of global companies are pushing hard for an end to the trade wars. Last week&nbsp;<a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6152231/THH-China-Tariffs-Company-Association-Letter-to.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">661 companies</a>&nbsp;wrote to President Trump asking him to settle the dispute, as corporate leaders are more committed than ever to their globalization strategies. These CEOs are especially anxious about Trump’s threat to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-25/pain-from-trump-s-china-tariffs-spreads-reshaping-global-trade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">levy 25% tariffs</a>&nbsp;on the remaining $300 billion in Chinese imports, which will trigger a corresponding increase in U.S. consumer prices and a significant reduction in demand.</p><a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/6152231/THH-China-Tariffs-Company-Association-Letter-to.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">661 companies</a><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-25/pain-from-trump-s-china-tariffs-spreads-reshaping-global-trade\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">levy 25% tariffs</a><p>If Presidents Trump and Xi are unable to reconcile their differences, trade threats and tariffs will continue with no end in sight. And without visionary political leaders and effective global institutions to unite nations around free trade, tariff wars are likely to slow economic growth and erase the benefits that such trade brings people around the world, marking the end of the 70-year era of free trade.</p><p><i>Bill George is a senior fellow at Harvard Business School, and former chairman and CEO of Medtronic.

      "<p>During the last four decades, the U.S. has experienced a form of capitalism that has led to growing economic inequality and increasing dissatisfaction with our capitalist system—a discontent highlighted by prominent politicians like presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who embrace tenets of democratic socialism. As economist Joseph Stiglitz recently&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/opinion/sunday/progressive-capitalism.html?searchResultPosition=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">warned</a>, “[T]he American economy is failing its citizens. Some 90% have seen their incomes stagnate or decline in the past 30 years.”</p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/04/19/opinion/sunday/progressive-capitalism.html?searchResultPosition=1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">warned</a><p>Ever since Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman wrote his 1970&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~thecore/doc/Friedman.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">article</a>, “The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits,” a debate has raged between financial advocates of shareholder primacy and business leaders who believe business must serve all its stakeholders. Beginning in the 1980s, short-term shareholders gained the upper hand as hedge funds, activist investors, and private equity firms pushed management teams to increase debt, cut costs to the bone, and forego long-term investments in order to return more cash to shareholders. The social contract of employment frayed, as even long-term employees realized they could be fired at any time, losing their pensions and health care. Overleveraging in the financial system resulted in the 2008 financial crisis, triggering the recession that followed, which greatly exacerbated income inequality.</p><a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~thecore/doc/Friedman.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">article</a><p>As a result, public confidence in capitalism has continued to decrease.</p><p>Fortunately, the tide is turning now toward a new model: responsible capitalism. Responsible capitalism recognizes that companies have a clear purpose to serve society, their customers, and their employees as well as their investors. When they do so, they create the most sustainable long-term value for their shareholders.

Last January, for instance, Blackrock founder and CEO Laurence Fink&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">wrote</a>&nbsp;in his annual letter to CEOs that with “the failure of government to provide lasting solutions, society is increasingly looking to companies, both public and private, to address pressing social and economic issues.” He called on CEOs to look beyond just profits and “begin with a clear embodiment of your company’s purpose in your business model and corporate strategy.”</p><a href=\"http://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">wrote</a><p>In JPMorgan Chase’s 2018 corporate responsibility report, CEO Jamie Dimon&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/corporate-responsibility/2018/cr-2018-jamie-dimon.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">called on</a>&nbsp;CEOs to “buck short-termism,” stating that “[w]hen everyone has a fair shot at participating in and sharing in the rewards of growth, the economy will be stronger and society more cohesive.”</p><a href=\"https://reports.jpmorganchase.com/corporate-responsibility/2018/cr-2018-jamie-dimon.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">called on</a><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://economicprinciples.org/Why-and-How-Capitalism-Needs-To-Be-Reformed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">his treatise</a>, “Why and How Capitalism Needs to Be Reformed,” Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio went even further in recognizing that “capitalism isn’t working well for most Americans,” noting low wage growth, the ascendant income gap, and educational failures. “These conditions pose an existential risk for the U.S.,” he emphasized. “I think the American dream is lost,” Dalio said on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ray-dalio-capitalism-needs-reform-wealth-inequality-is-a-national-emergency-60-minutes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">CBS</a>, also stating that he believed the growing wage gap to be “a national emergency.”</p><a href=\"https://economicprinciples.org/Why-and-How-Capitalism-Needs-To-Be-Reformed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">his treatise</a><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ray-dalio-capitalism-needs-reform-wealth-inequality-is-a-national-emergency-60-minutes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">CBS</a><p>These powerful voices cannot be ignored. Capitalists must take the lead in reforming capitalism from its unrestrained vices into its responsible virtues. When practiced responsibly, capitalism can be the greatest wealth creator and builder of societies and nations. But when wealth is hoarded by the powerful few at the expense of the many, people question the legitimacy of the economic system.</p><p>Recognizing the challenges of income inequality, global warming, rising health care costs, data privacy, and technological obsolescence, corporate CEOs are stepping up to address societal challenges through their mainstream missions.

Middle-class and poorer Americans clearly cannot afford these costs, nor can their employers. While offering all U.S. citizens free health care using a single-payer system sounds attractive as a political talking point, actually implementing Medicare for All would require a complex restructuring of a multi-trillion dollar industry. The likely result? A disaster.</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/12/06/americans-shelled-out-10739-per-person-on-healthcare-last-year.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">cost</a><p>Covering&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.census.gov/popclock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">all Americans</a>&nbsp;under Medicare for All could potentially add&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/fastfacts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">another</a>189 million people to the government’s payrolls, which would swamp the current government approval and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/cms-fast-facts/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">payment system</a>—especially since the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services require prior approval for many medical tests and procedures. More importantly, the Medicare and Medicaid payment system is almost entirely based on fee for service, wherein hospitals, physicians, and pharmaceutical dispensers are paid for services rendered. Naturally, this can incentivize doctors and hospitals to require more office visits, do more procedures, and conduct more tests to get paid more.</p><a href=\"https://www.census.gov/popclock/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">all Americans</a><a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/fastfacts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">another</a><a href=\"https://www.cms.gov/research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/cms-fast-facts/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">payment system</a><p>These perverse incentives are exacerbated by underpayment schedules in which Medicare reimburses well below hospital costs. In 2017,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://revcycleintelligence.com/news/medicare-medicaid-reimbursement-76.8b-under-hospital-costs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medicare and Medicare reimbursement</a>&nbsp;was $76.8 billion below cost and hospitals provided an additional $38.4 billion in uncompensated care. These underpayments force hospitals to increase costs to patients covered by commercial insurance. This cost-shifting distorts the billing system and places an unnecessary cost burden on non-government patients and their employers.</p><a href=\"https://revcycleintelligence.com/news/medicare-medicaid-reimbursement-76.8b-under-hospital-costs\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Medicare and Medicare reimbursement</a><p>Medicare for All proposes&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/03/25/medicare-for-all-eliminate-private-insurance/\">to eliminate</a>&nbsp;the entire commercial insurance industry—putting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.iii.org/presentation/insurance-industry-employment-trends-1990-2018-january-2019-031119\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">538,600 people</a>&nbsp;out of work.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/blogs/how-much-will-medicare-all-cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estimates</a>&nbsp;that Medicare for All would require tripling of payroll taxes or more than doubling all other taxes. The Mercatus Center, however,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/blahous-costs-medicare-mercatus-working-paper-v1_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">found</a>&nbsp;that “doubling all federal individual and corporate income taxes going forward would be insufficient to fully finance the plan.”</p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/02/13/694199256/u-s-national-debt-hits-22-trillion-a-new-record-thats-predicted-to-fall\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">$22 trillion</a><a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/current-u-s-federal-budget-deficit-3305783\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">exceeding $1 trillion</a><a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/blogs/how-much-will-medicare-all-cost\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">estimates</a><a href=\"https://www.mercatus.org/system/files/blahous-costs-medicare-mercatus-working-paper-v1_1.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">found</a><p>It is easy for voters to support the plan if they think they will get their health care for free, but when they realize their taxes will increase, approval drops dramatically. A Kaiser Family Foundation&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-january-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">poll</a>&nbsp;found that net favorability to Medicare for All is negative 23% with when participants hear it would require increases to taxes, and a staggering negative 44% when people hear it would cause delays in getting tests and procedures.</p><a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-reform/poll-finding/kff-health-tracking-poll-january-2019/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">poll</a><p>Rather than toss out our current system of health care insurance for a government-run system, it is time to find ways to further improve the ACA. Here are a few proposals to do that:</p><p>First, there should be a shift from “fee for service” to “pay for value,” thus reducing the total cost of the patient’s care.</p><p>Second, shift more government-covered people to Medicare Advantage, whereby private insurers receive a sum of money to manage their patients annually.</p><p>Third, put a greater emphasis on healthy living. I estimate that over 50% of health care costs are the result of unhealthy lifestyles such as unhealthy eating and drinking, lack of exercise, and stress. Greater focus on these areas would prevent people from getting sick in the first place and accelerate healing when they are ill.</p><p>Fourth, expand Medicaid coverage to more people experiencing economic difficulties and provide adequate health care before their conditions become severe and they wind up in the emergency room.</p><p>Fifth, revise the ACA to permit the federal government to negotiate drug prices with pharmaceutical companies, while enabling streamlined distribution of drugs from manufacturers to patients with certified physician prescriptions. This would reduce the rapid escalation in drug prices since ACA was enacted.</p><p>Sixth, enhance the insurance exchanges by permitting a public option. This would provide increased price competition in the exchanges, lowering costs for families purchasing insurance on the market.</p><p>Instead of unrealistic debates about Medicare for All, we should focus on ways to improve our current system, reduce health care costs, and make the Affordable Care Act work effectively for all Americans.</p><p><i>Bill George is a senior fellow at Harvard Business School and former chair and CEO of Medtronic.

With the federal government paralyzed by gridlock, responsible business leaders have collaborated with state and local government officials, non-profits, academics, and educators to devise local and national solutions to these seemingly intractable problems.

This model works as long as companies continue to invest for the future in difficult times as well as boom times.</p><p>As CEO of the world’s largest investment fund, BlackRock’s Larry Fink has led the way with his annual&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public letter</a>, insisting that CEOs have strategic plans integral to their business models to use their resources to address societal problems. Other prominent CEOs, like General Motors’ Mary Barra and PepsiCo’s former CEO Indra Nooyi, have been passionate advocates for the purpose-driven approach to address societal problems.</p><a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">public letter</a><p>As a result of their leadership, coupled with the evident pitfalls of maximizing shareholder value, most CEOs that I know are shifting their companies to become purpose-driven, values-centered organizations. While they have the resources and the talent to contribute to solving tough societal problems, they cannot do it alone, of course. With the federal government paralyzed by gridlock, responsible business leaders have collaborated with state and local government officials, non-profits, academics, and educators to devise local and national solutions to these seemingly intractable problems. Business leaders like these offer the best hope of creating responsible capitalism that serves the needs of society.</p><p><i>Bill George is a senior fellow at Harvard Business School, former chairman and CEO of Medtronic, and the author of&nbsp;</i>Discover Your True North<i>.

The billionaire founder of Amazon, the Blue Origin space flight company, and owner of the Washington Post – in the midst of a divorce from his novelist wife MacKenzie –&nbsp;found himself in tabloid purgatory after the National Enquirer published intimate text exchanges between Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, the former Los Angeles television news anchor with whom he was having an extramarital affair.</p><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/talkingtech/2019/02/08/amazons-jeff-bezos-shows-how-medium-blogger-platform-of-choice/2809592002/\" data-track-label=\"inline|intext|n/a\">Medium blog website</a><p>But that’s not all. Through the years, Bezos, a demanding boss, has been accused of creating a brutally cutthroat workforce culture at Amazon. What’s more, despite his enormous wealth, he has also been labeled stingy.</p><p>At the same time, Amazon has grown so big that concerns are often raised about its powerful and disruptive tentacles, which reach the cloud via Amazon Web Services, store shelves at Whole Foods&nbsp;and kitchen countertops through the familiar voice of Alexa.</p><p>Most recently, Amazon has encountered&nbsp;criticism&nbsp;for its drawn-out and controversial sweepstakes to decide which municipality would be granted its second corporate headquarters, an award that eventually went to Northern Virginia and Long Island City, New York, though the saga may not be over. The Washington Post on Friday published a report that Amazon may be reconsidering the New York location&nbsp;over a political and community backlash.</p><p>“His reputation hasn’t been stellar before for these other reasons, not to say these claims are true,” says Ari Ginsberg, a professor of entrepreneurship and management at the New York University’s Stern School of Business.</p><p>Bezos, of course, would probably be the first to admit that his Medium post, and the events surrounding it, wouldn’t be the preferred approach to bolster his reputation.</p><p>“Of course I don’t want personal photos published, but I also won’t participate in their (AMI’s) well-known practice of blackmail, political favors, political attacks&nbsp;and corruption. I prefer to stand up, roll this log over, and see what crawls out,” Bezos wrote.</p><p>“It’s sort of an interesting way to achieve a positive benefit,” says brand strategist Bob Killian of Killian Branding, adding that it’s a very low bar to rise above the National Enquirer.</p><p>For the most part, Bezos has been a reclusive leader with a profile that, until recently, hadn’t matched that of Tesla’s Elon Musk or Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, both of whom have run into their own problems, though different.</p><p>&nbsp;“My inkling is if he were thrown in a lineup, most people couldn’t pick him out,” branding expert Rob Frankel says of Bezos.</p><p>Topping the Forbes list and running the Post, even as he’s left day-to-day management to the journalists, has surely raised Bezos’ visibility. He has also been a frequent target of President Donald Trump. But it took the Sanchez-National Enquirer affair to plaster Bezos’ mug on the front pages of the tabloids.</p><h2>Taking down rich and famous</h2><p>The risk to Bezos’ reputation comes with the three things Frankel claims Americans can’t get enough of: a rags-to-riches story, the lives of the rich and famous, and seeing the rich and famous get taken down.</p><p>“For better or worse, he’s going to get pummeled. This is going to be a very bad year for the man,” Frankel says.</p><p>But Killian takes the opposite view: “It’s such a ho-hum, rich-guy-has-a-mistress-and-P.S.-so-what (story). But now, this sort of evil enterprise tries to blackmail him&nbsp;and he fights back by doing something very bold&nbsp;– that’s a much better story,” Killian says.</p><h2>The impact on Amazon</h2><p>Bezos&nbsp;may himself be tarnished,&nbsp;but experts don’t expect Amazon to take a&nbsp;hit.</p><p>Bill George, a former CEO at Medtronic and now a professor at Harvard Business School, thinks Bezos made a terrible mistake when he got into this situation in the first place since he should know better that&nbsp;anything you say, write, or post can be too easily shared.</p><p>“CEOs are public figures, and Bezos is one of the most public figures there is, even though he’s a private person,”&nbsp;George says. “I think he wasn’t thinking clearly when he did these things.&nbsp;He is the reputation of Amazon and rapidly becoming the reputation of the Washington Post. Does this harm (them), you bet.”</p><p>But George believes the harm he caused is minor, because&nbsp;Bezos ultimately&nbsp;did the right thing&nbsp;by being transparent&nbsp;and not giving into the blackmail.</p><p>“I don’t believe it’s going to have any influence on Amazon at all,” Frankel insists. “As long as (consumers) can get free shipping on a pair of slippers over $25, they’re going to (shop there).”</p><p>Ginsberg agrees: “I don’t think this is going to worry the shareholders and impact the stock. What’s more important is what the company is doing strategically in terms of technological advancements, and growth into new areas. … I don’t think customers are going to stop using Amazon because of what’s happened over the last week, (and) I don’t think this puts a cloud over the company or the company’s leadership.”</p><p><em>This content was originally published on <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/02/09/jeff-bezos-fights-back-against-national-enquirer-help-his-rep/2812515002/\">USAToday.com</a> on 2/9/2019.</em></p><em>This content was originally published on <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/02/09/jeff-bezos-fights-back-against-national-enquirer-help-his-rep/2812515002/\">USAToday.com</a> on 2/9/2019.</em><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2019/02/09/jeff-bezos-fights-back-against-national-enquirer-help-his-rep/2812515002/\">USAToday.com</a><div></div>"

      "<p>In the past decade, companies have shifted away from competency leadership models to the authentic leadership development model, prompting the&nbsp;<i>Harvard Business Review</i>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-authenticity-paradox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to declare</a>&nbsp;that “authenticity has become the gold standard for leadership.” Authentic leadership programs help leaders develop their character, their values, and the inner side of their leadership, which are essential to leading other people.</p><i>Harvard Business Review</i><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-authenticity-paradox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">to declare</a><p>In contrast to prior leadership theories driven by academic scholars, the shift to authentic leadership development has primarily come from leadership practitioners. Companies are recognizing that having authentic leaders at all levels results in superior long-term performance and reduces the impact of the so-called jerks who have caused so many problems.</p><p>Yet being an authentic leader is much easier said than done.</p><p>When&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/facebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a>&nbsp;founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg confronted the privacy crisis in the wake of the Cambridge Analytica scandal in March 2018, he disappeared for five days. He sent his associate general counsel to represent him at Facebook’s town hall, and blamed Cambridge Analytica in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/21/technology/mark-zuckerberg-cambridge-analytica-response/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">his CNN interview</a>&nbsp;instead of taking personal responsibility.</p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/facebook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Facebook</a><a href=\"https://money.cnn.com/2018/03/21/technology/mark-zuckerberg-cambridge-analytica-response/index.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">his CNN interview</a><p>In reality, most of us deviate from the standards of authentic leadership at crucial times. Many leaders who perform well when things are going their way behave inauthentically in a crisis and are thus unable to make the bold decisions called for in their leadership. Other leaders create a false persona that projects having everything perfectly under control, when in reality, they have many doubts and uncertainties. But in today’s more transparent world, leaders cannot “<a href=\"https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/you-won-t-make-it-if-you-fake-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fake it to make it</a>.” Inevitably, their colleagues know who is authentic and who isn’t.</p><a href=\"https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/you-won-t-make-it-if-you-fake-it\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">fake it to make it</a><p>Through working with tens of thousands of authentic leaders in the past decade in classrooms and companies, our Harvard Business School leadership teaching team has heard myriad stories about leaders’ doubts, times they lost their way, and the crucibles they faced. Many of these leaders had worked in earnest to develop themselves as authentic leaders, yet still they went off track.</p><p>Most leaders struggle with their desire for money, fame, and power. There is nothing inherently wrong with achieving financial success and security. Furthermore, there is nothing inappropriate with seeking promotions and recognition for your work. However, if the desire for external validation becomes an end in itself, then it can turn into a craving that controls one’s life. Commanding large numbers of people, attaining promotions, accumulating wealth, or achieving celebrity too often seduces leaders into believing they are superior to others. That’s when hubris takes over. At this point the pendulum has swung from intrinsic motivators—fulfilling a mission, living your values, contributing to the world—to the extrinsic motivators of money, power, and fame.</p><p>As former Novartis CEO Daniel Vasella explained in a&nbsp;<i>Fortune</i>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/11/18/332268/index.htm\">magazine interview</a>: “[T]he idea of being a successful manager…is an intoxicating one. It is a pattern of celebration leading to belief, leading to distortion. When you achieve good results…you are typically celebrated, and you begin to believe that the figure at the center of all that champagne-toasting is yourself.”</p><i>Fortune</i><a href=\"http://archive.fortune.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/11/18/332268/index.htm\">magazine interview</a><p>The desire for external validation has brought down such celebrated leaders as General Electric’s Jeff Immelt, Wells Fargo’s John Stumpf, McKinsey’s Rajat Gupta, and Nissan’s Carlos Ghosn.

Recently, he was arrested by Japanese authorities, and forced to resign as CEO of both Nissan and Renault.</p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/21/business/dealbook/rajat-gupta-to-finish-prison-sentence-at-home-in-new-york.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">130 million net worth</a><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2019/01/28/sec-nissan-carlos-ghosn-pay/\">large amounts</a><p>These are but a few of the myriad stories of high-caliber leaders who let their need for external validation cause them to lose sight of their values and their ethics.</p><p>How can leaders avoid these pitfalls and behave authentically? First, they need to acknowledge their desires for external validation and then balance them with their internal compass that enables them to stay on course for their True North.</p><p>Speaking for myself, I enjoy financial security, taking nice vacations, and providing education for family members, but I also know that I am susceptible to getting caught up in seeking good ratings in the Harvard classroom and praise for television appearances. I try to offset these temptations by practicing mindfulness, having two support groups, and getting honest feedback. These techniques enable me to focus on my purpose of helping leaders achieve their full potential through my teaching, coaching, and writing.</p><p>Because there are no precise measures of successful leadership, many leaders judge themselves by external metrics like stock prices, numerical results, salary increases, and promotions. In reality, these are very superficial standards. Better measures would include the capacity to inspire people to perform at their peak, set standards of excellence, maintain strong values, demonstrate the highest ethics, act decisively in a crisis, and touch people’s hearts at crucial times.</p><p>For leaders to meet these latter standards, they must know themselves, their beliefs, values, and leadership principles. By processing their life stories, understanding times they have lost their way, and reflecting on their crucibles, leaders can discover their True North. This requires self-examination to discern what they have learned from their experiences, what is most important in their lives, and the beliefs, values, and principles they hold most dear. Then they need to test their self-perception against their behaviors by getting honest feedback from people who know them well.</p><p>Through regular practices like mindfulness and honest feedback, authentic leaders develop the moral compass that will pull them back to True North when they get off track. As the result of their efforts, authentic leaders develop such a strong sense of who they are that they reduce the risk of letting the desire for external validation overwhelm their True North.</p><p>That is the path to becoming a true authentic leader.</p><p><i>Bill George is a senior fellow at Harvard Business School, former chairman and CEO of Medtronic, and the author of&nbsp;</i>Discover Your True North<i>.

Last spring, the&nbsp;<i>Guardian&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">broke stories</a>&nbsp;on Cambridge Analytica’s use of Facebook sites to gain access to user data, including Facebook friends connected to these sites, to influence the 2016 U.S. election, triggering extreme political and media reactions.</p><i>Guardian&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/series/cambridge-analytica-files\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">broke stories</a><p>Mark Zuckerberg’s response? He went into hiding for five days, even sending his associate general counsel to replace him at Facebook’s regular employee town hall. When he did appear in public, he tried to blame everything on Cambridge Analytica. Six months later, Zuckerberg still hasn’t addressed the real issues and continues to react defensively as new issues arise. His distortions and deflections incited Facebook’s critics and invited the media to dig deeper. In response, Facebook&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/21/facebook-admits-definers-pr-george-soros-critics-sandberg-zuckerberg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hired</a>&nbsp;attack dog PR firms to go after its detractors.</p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/nov/21/facebook-admits-definers-pr-george-soros-critics-sandberg-zuckerberg\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">hired</a><p>Facebook’s problems are much deeper than Cambridge Analytica. It has amassed 2.1 billion users with the offer of a free site. But users are largely unaware that Facebook takes their private information to create highly detailed user profiles to sell to advertisers.</p><p>The privacy issue can be easily overcome by requiring users to opt in or opt out of permitting Facebook to profile their information, and charging monthly fees for opting out.

      "<div><em>At the height of the 2008 financial crisis, these four corporate leaders stepped forward—and changed how we think of leadership forever, says&nbsp;<strong>Bill George.</strong></em></div><em>At the height of the 2008 financial crisis, these four corporate leaders stepped forward—and changed how we think of leadership forever, says&nbsp;<strong>Bill George.</strong></em><strong>Bill George.</strong><p>Four titans who defined a new era in business during the past decade recently concluded their terms: PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi, Unilever’s Paul Polman, Mayo Clinic’s John Noseworthy, and US Bancorp’s Richard Davis.</p><p>When they became CEOs, the Great Recession of 2008 was consuming the world’s attention. Many speculated about the possibility of a new depression, a&nbsp;collapsing stock market, and extreme unemployment. Some observers even began to question the foundations of capitalism, arguing it needed to change in order to endure.</p><p>Nooyi, Polman, Noseworthy, and Davis recognized that business had to contribute to society in meaningful ways, not just profit from it. They believed that organization had to benefit all stakeholders: their customers, employees, shareholders, and communities and that this approach would result in sustained increases in revenues, earnings, employment, and shareholder value. Through their leadership they encouraged other corporate leaders to embrace this multi-stakeholder approach. Harvard Business School’s Michael E. Porter called this idea “<a href=\"https://www.isc.hbs.edu/creating-shared-value/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creating shared value</a>” in January 2011.</p><a href=\"https://www.isc.hbs.edu/creating-shared-value/Pages/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">creating shared value</a><p>Let’s examine how each of these leaders refined their organizations’ missions and created sustained success.</p><h3>The Visionary: PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi</h3><p>India-born Indra Nooyi immigrated to the United&nbsp;States in 1978 to study at Yale University. She joined PepsiCo in 1994 and rose rapidly through its ranks. When she was named CEO in 2006, Nooyi recognized the growing obesity crisis and saw how food and beverages were impacting consumer health.</p><p>In early 2007, she launched PepsiCo’s new mission, “Performance with Purpose.” She committed to reduce the sugar and sodium in PepsiCo’s core snacks and sodas, which generated most of the company’s revenue, and created the Global Nutrition Group to add healthier products to its lineup.</p><p>When soft drink sales declined in 2010, shareholders criticized PepsiCo’s execution. Nooyi responded by beefing up PepsiCo’s marketing and strengthening her leadership team—but held firm to her strategy. By 2012, Pepsi was producing excellent results, which continued unabated through 2018. In 2013-14 Nooyi had to fend off activist investor Nelson Peltz, who called for breaking the company in two, never wavering from her strategy.</p><p>Nooyi may have been ahead of her time, as America’s obesity crisis has only recently started to impact consumer behavior, which has given rise to many new healthy food companies and forced all food and beverage companies to adapt. Nooyi will always be remembered for recognizing the importance of food and beverages on consumers’ health.</p><h3>The Statesman: Unilever’s Paul Polman</h3><p>Netherlands-born Paul Polman spent 30 years in leadership roles at Procter &amp; Gamble and Nestlé before becoming CEO of Unilever in 2009. Observing the dangers of global warming, Polman focused on sustainability, introducing Unilever’s Sustainable Living Plan and applying it to Unilever’s products and supply chain.</p><p>Polman is a strong advocate for the multi-stakeholder approach. In 2011, he told shareholders, “My job is not to serve shareholders, but to serve Unilever’s customers and consumers.” He then suspended quarterly earnings reporting, enabling executives to concentrate on long-term transformation. His advocacy for sustainability earned him the United Nations Foundation’s Champion for Global Change Award in 2014.</p><p>Polman faced his toughest test when Kraft Heinz launched a hostile takeover bid in 2017. Within 48 hours, Polman rejected the bid and convinced Kraft Heinz to withdraw its offer. Then he outlined a seven-point plan to improve shareholder value, never wavering on his commitment to sustainability. Since then, Unilever stock is up 20 percent from pre-bid levels, while Kraft Heinz stock declined 50 percent.</p><p>Some consider Polman an enigma. One day he’s hailing the benefits of sustainability and long-term focus at the World Economic Forum, and the next day&nbsp;<a class=\"ext\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/25/bill-george-as-consumer-giants-struggle-unilever-rises-above-the-pack.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">he’s demanding&nbsp;improved performance</a>&nbsp;from Unilever’s senior executives. In my view, Polman isn’t an enigma at all, but a world statesman who exemplifies all the qualities CEOs require in this era.</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/05/25/bill-george-as-consumer-giants-struggle-unilever-rises-above-the-pack.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">he’s demanding&nbsp;improved performance</a><h3>The Healer: John Noseworthy</h3><p>When John Noseworthy became CEO of Mayo Clinic in 2009, the world-famous medical center was struggling financially. Congress would soon be negotiating the terms of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the Obama Administration’s signature health care legislation.</p><p>From the outset, Noseworthy built on the values of the Mayo brothers and Mayo Clinic’s historic mission of putting patients first. He prioritized Mayo’s focus on the most complex diseases patients faced, using its research to develop new treatments for many diseases. He reorganized Mayo into a single system of patient care at three major sites to deliver the highest quality care at lowest cost. Noseworthy also took the leadership in Washington to ensure ACA gave priority to patient outcomes.</p><p>Noseworthy’s focus on superior quality and patient outcomes elevated Mayo to No. 1 on US News &amp; World Report’s “Best Hospital” list the last three years. He has restored Mayo to financial strength, increasing annual revenues to $12 billion while reducing costs. A $3.6 billion fundraising campaign further strengthened its balance sheet. With the help of a skilled team of physician leaders and administrators, John Noseworthy will be remembered for elevating Mayo as a great healer for millions of people.</p><h3>The Servant Leader: Richard Davis</h3><p>Richard Davis started his career as a bank teller, and became the most successful commercial banker in America after US Bancorp named him CEO in 2006.</p><p>Under his leadership, US Bancorp became America’s seventh-largest bank with the highest return on equity. He guided it through the 2008-09 financial crisis without a glitch by avoiding high-risk subprime mortgages and derivatives that felled so many other banks. Concerned about the crisis’ impact on bank reputations, Davis stepped up to chair the industry’s Financial Services Roundtable, working with President Obama and congressional leaders on solutions to restore the industry, including the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act.</p><p>Described by a fellow CEO as having a “<a class=\"ext\" href=\"http://www.startribune.com/may-25-u-s-bank-ceo-richard-davis-banker-body-preacher-soul/260554221/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banker body, preacher soul</a>,” Davis believes that bankers must be community leaders, not just profit makers. He frames its civic mission in broad terms, “We’re bankers, and it’s our role to get into the community and give back.”</p><a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/may-25-u-s-bank-ceo-richard-davis-banker-body-preacher-soul/260554221/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">banker body, preacher soul</a><p>Davis walks his talk. In Minnesota, he has chaired the Minnesota Business Partnership, the Minnesota Orchestral Association, and Greater MSP. He also led the Minnesota Super Bowl LII Host Committee, and serves on the Mayo Clinic and American Red Cross boards.</p><p>Davis leads with unimpeachable integrity. When arch-rival Wells Fargo encountered its problems with three million unauthorized customer accounts, he told his leaders that anyone who tried to take advantage of Wells Fargo’s difficulties would be dismissed.</p><p>Richard Davis will be remembered as a true servant leader who always puts&nbsp;others’ interests ahead of his own, making him a role model for all bankers. He was recently named CEO of Make-A-Wish America foundation.</p><h3>A legacy takes shape</h3><p>Nooyi, Polman, Noseworthy, and Davis ultimately set the new standard of leadership in this era, never wavering from their purpose and values. They became role models for the business community by serving society through their organizations, strengthening their companies and communities at the same time. With their collective breadth of experience and perspective, these leaders will influence business and society for decades to come. Now global leaders such as General Motors’s Mary Barra, Merck’s Ken Frazier, BlackRock’s Larry Fink, and Salesforce’s Marc Benioff must now carry that mantle for the next generation.</p><p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of&nbsp;<u><a class=\"ext\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Discover-Your-True-North-George/dp/1119082943/ref=dp_ob_title_bk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discover Your True North</a></u>.

Last year, Berglund opened the Finnegans Brewery &amp; Taproom in Minneapolis. The Elliot Park complex includes the Finnovation Lab, an entrepreneurship incubator for mission-driven businesses.</p><p>“I’m driven by my passion to prove that you can do well and do good—running a successful business and benefiting others are not mutually exclusive.”</p><p><strong>Question</strong>&nbsp;Yours was the first beer company in the world to donate 100 percent of its profits to charity. Sixteen years later, with mounting competition, you opened a brewery and taproom. How does a benefit corporation set itself up for growth?</p><strong>Question</strong><p><strong>Answer</strong>&nbsp;We decided to go big or go home, but that meant we needed to raise capital for the brewery. We needed investors, and that’s complicated for a 100 percent donation model business. So we changed our structure. I looked to Newman’s Own—the longest-running benefits company—for advice. They’ve really taken me under their wing, and any time I have questions, they are there to help.</p><strong>Answer</strong><p>The new structure is a bit more complicated but better positions us for growth and to increase our giving. FINNEGANS Brew Co. is a new company created to brew the beer and operate the brewery and taproom through a licensing agreement with Finnegans SBC (specific benefit corporation), which continues to donate 100 percent of its profits. Royalties from the brewery go to the FINNEGANS Community Fund, which is dedicated to alleviating hunger. In a nutshell, this model—the Newman’s Own model—allowed us to get working capital into the business and still be true to our mission.</p><p>My competitors tend to think I’m nuts. But I’m driven by my passion to prove that you can do well and do good—running a successful business and benefiting others are not mutually exclusive. And this recent expansion shows you can scale a social business model. We’ve already made a $1.3 million impact since 2003. We want to be a catalyst for others. With our new Finnovation Lab, we’re growing, supporting, and launching social businesses. We’re seeing more and more entrepreneurs saying, “We want to do something good, too.” Right out of college, they’re launching socially minded businesses. It’s so inspiring, and we’re here to guide them.</p><h2>Andy Huynh</h2><p>Andy Huynh is founder and chief technology officer of BTM Global, a systems integration firm with 130 employees and offices in Minneapolis and Vietnam. BTM donates time, materials, and money to vulnerable children in the Twin Cities and in Vietnam, where Huynh was born and raised until he immigrated to Minnesota when he was 13. In 2018, Huynh and other BTM executives founded Kid Promise, a nonprofit devoted to improving the lives of children in Vietnam.</p><p>“Our employees know that the leadership team cares—not just about revenue.” ­­</p><p><strong>Question&nbsp;</strong>You’ve made it a priority to give back since the inception of BTM Global in 2004—but without any of the hype we see from some mission-driven brands today. So where do your business and your philanthropic goals intersect? And how do you manage both?</p><strong>Question&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Answer&nbsp;</strong>In order to help others, you’ve got to make sure you’re successful in whatever you do first. I really wasn’t thinking about doing charitable work when I started this business, after working in the field for many years. But when we opened our office in Vietnam 14 years ago, a couple of charitable organizations approached and asked me to visit their orphanages. I looked around and thought, they need a lot of help. So BTM started donating clothing, food, and supplies. Then I started looking to do more.</p><strong>Answer&nbsp;</strong><p>Our company is built around having good people—we are a service business. If you want a company to grow, your resource is the younger generation. That’s why our focus is around children. In a better environment, kids can strive for a better life. Education is a vehicle to get out of poverty.</p><p>We give back because it comes from our hearts. But after so many years of doing this work, we had people who wanted to help. We recently started a foundation so we could take donations. We are small. We want 99 cents of every dollar going directly to families, to children in need. We all pitch in. We just try to do as much as we can with our time, with the resources we have.</p><p>Every day, we do the work we enjoy and also get the chance to help others as much as we can. Our employees know that the leadership team cares—not just about revenue. We want to make sure people [at BTM] are successful and also help others so that someday they’ll have a chance to get to where they want to be. And maybe someday, they’ll come work for us.</p><h2>Kevin Warren</h2><p>Kevin Warren is chief operating officer of the Minnesota Vikings.</p><p>“I challenge everyone to view the tough issues we face in society with a positive and energetic spirit and focus on making the world a better place.”</p><p><strong>Question</strong>&nbsp;You were the keynote speaker for the 2018 Minnesota Keystone celebration. The Minnesota Vikings are part of the Keystone program, and the Vikings created the Minnesota Vikings Foundation in 2017. How are the Vikings improving the lives of children through the foundation’s work? How do you think companies should address their corporate responsibilities to make communities better for people, especially those facing financial challenges?</p><strong>Question</strong><p><strong>Answer</strong>&nbsp;It is very important that every human being, regardless of race, color, gender, financial status, sexual orientation, or religious beliefs, should honestly believe that they can reach their goals, be empowered, and also protected when discrimination occurs. Although not easy, I challenge everyone to view the tough issues we face in society with a positive and energetic spirit and focus on making the world a better place on a daily basis.</p><strong>Answer</strong><p>Under the leadership of the Wilf family, the Minnesota Vikings have made it a priority to create positive change for children within the Twin Cities and across every community within the boundaries of Minnesota. We seek each and every day to empower our youth through initiatives involving health, education, physical activity, and overall positive energy. The success of our children will dictate the future success of our world.</p><p>Both companies and individuals who have been blessed financially have a fiduciary responsibility to create better and stronger communities by using time, energy, and financial resources for individuals who are facing financial challenges.</p><h2>Jim and Carmen Campbell</h2><p>Jim Campbell is the former CEO of Wells Fargo Minnesota. Both Campbells are longtime community volunteers.</p><p>“Each commitment states their sense of responsibility and what it means to be socially accountable to all of their stakeholders, including current and future employees, consumers, and our communities.”</p><p><strong>Question</strong>&nbsp;The two of you have been involved in philanthropy for decades. How have you seen philanthropy change over the years and what lessons would you share with young entrepreneurs who are just beginning to give back to their communities?</p><strong>Question</strong><p><strong>Answer</strong>&nbsp;Over the years of working to make our community a better place to live and work, we are pleased that corporate responsibility has continued to develop as each corporation has continued to define corporate responsibility for their unique business. Each commitment states their sense of responsibility and what it means to be socially accountable to all of their stakeholders, including current and future employees, consumers, and our communities.</p><strong>Answer</strong><p>We are proud that Minnesota businesses have taken the lead nationally in the development of their plans. These commitments are reflected in Minnesota’s high quality of life. Having said that, however, there is so much more that must be done.</p><p>We have good feelings about the next generation as they are involved by serving on boards of nonprofit organizations, working to raise money for worthy causes, and assuming leadership roles.</p><p>Early in our lives, we had time but not much money. Our involvement early in our careers in various organizations helped develop our skills and provided the necessary learning experiences that allowed us to step into leadership roles when it was our time. We recommend that the next generation get involved in something that interests them. We advise: Give of your time and talents; set an example for others of giving back.</p><h2>Kate Kelly</h2><p>Kate Kelly is president of PNC Bank in Minnesota and chair of the ServeMinnesota Commission, a nonprofit, nonpartisan association that works on pressing community needs. America’s Service Commissions named her 2018 Outstanding Commissioner for her work with the group since 2007.</p><p>“It’s one thing to write a check; it’s another thing to actually write a check and get involved by donating your time. It’s important to see and experience what’s behind the financial horsepower.”</p><p><strong>Question</strong>&nbsp;Why is community service important to you and how does it influence the way you lead the bank?</p><strong>Question</strong><p><strong>Answer</strong>&nbsp;Improving early childhood education is a great passion of mine. I’ve been on ServeMinnesota Commission’s board of directors since 2007 and have devoted countless hours a week to its cause. The fact that PNC employees see it as their passion has made it so rewarding to work here. We’re doing whatever we can to create an environment where learning is taking place.</p><strong>Answer</strong><p>Equally important as how we work with and support our customers is a focus on how we care for the communities where we live, work, and play. PNC builds strategic relationships with community-based nonprofits that promote growth and cultural enrichment through economic development initiatives, as well as initiatives that enhance educational opportunities for young children.</p><p>It’s one thing to write a check; it’s another thing to actually write a check and get involved by donating your time. It’s important to see and experience what’s behind the financial horsepower. In other words, it actually resonates when you get involved versus just seeing a check written from a distance. At PNC, we’ve always understood the connection between prosperous communities and our success. That is why PNC and its employees invest time, energy, and resources to support efforts that improve quality of life and bring economic and cultural vibrancy to the communities in which we operate.</p><p>PNC gives its employees up to 40 hours a year of paid time off to volunteer in early childhood programs. The hours can only be used to participate in activities related to PNC’s Grow Up Great initiative, which focuses on improving early childhood education. Because we’ve had this focused approach, we’ve seen a lot more success in being able to move the needle.</p><p>Earlier this year, ServeMinnesota received a $580,000 grant from the PNC Foundation to support early numeracy, math, and reading skills proficiency for pre-kindergarten students. The grant was the largest the PNC Foundation has made in Minnesota and was also the largest recorded investment in early numeracy from a private funder.</p><h2>David Reiling</h2><p>David Reiling is CEO of St. Paul-based Sunrise Banks. Under his leadership, Sunrise became Minnesota’s first bank certified as a community development financial institution, a legal benefit corporation, and a member of the Global Alliance of Banking on Values.</p><p>“At the end of the day, if the community succeeds, we will be able to thrive along with them.”</p><p><strong>Question</strong>&nbsp;Would Sunrise Banks be as successful in the urban core of Minneapolis and St. Paul were it not a Certified B Corp? What is the advantage of running a bank as a mission-driven business?</p><strong>Question</strong><p><strong>Answer&nbsp;</strong>Sunrise isn’t your average bank; we are a social enterprise first. That’s been our focus since the beginning. We strive to be the most innovative bank empowering financial wellness. From our start, we have been focused on partnering with the neighborhoods and communities we serve to provide products and services to help them succeed. At the end of the day, if the community succeeds, we will be able to thrive along with them.</p><strong>Answer&nbsp;</strong><p>Being named Best for the World, a distinction given by B Lab (a nonprofit dedicated to solving social and environmental problems through business) to the top 10 percent of all B corporations, for the sixth consecutive year sends a clear message to consumers and business partners around the world that we are serious about our mission. It isn’t just a quote on the wall or in a handbook, it’s baked into our DNA. It’s reflected in our products, services, and employees. That is what brings people to our team but also what keeps people here—the belief that if we work to empower our partners and customers, we can not only succeed, we can make a positive impact as well.</p><p>More and more, having a social mission isn’t just an extra, it’s becoming an expectation. And as consumers and businesses continually look for companies that are concerned about social good, Sunrise rises to the top being known as a trusted partner/bank. We have found the key in linking our success and mission together, so that the more we focus on our mission, the better we do and the more we can grow.</p><h2>Bill and Penny George</h2><p>Bill George is a senior fellow at Harvard Business School and former chair and CEO of Medtronic. Penny George is chair of the George Family Foundation.</p><p>“We believe business leaders and their families have a special obligation to give back to their communities.”</p><p><strong>Question</strong>&nbsp;You were very successful in business and used some of your wealth to found the George Family Foundation. Why is it important for business leaders to be involved in philanthropy? Your foundation’s funding priorities include integrative health and healing and authentic leadership. Please share some of the impact your foundation has had in these areas.</p><strong>Question</strong><p><strong>Answer</strong>&nbsp;We believe business leaders and their families have a special obligation to give back to their communities. Penny and I have been blessed with many societal benefits that we recognize are not equally distributed, education and health care among them. Penny and I feel called to make a positive difference and to encourage others to do the same.</p><strong>Answer</strong><p>We established George Family Foundation in 1994. The foundation’s mission is to foster wholeness in body, mind, spirit, and community by developing authentic leaders and supporting transformative programs serving the common good. We believe in the spiritual reciprocity that exists between donors and those doing the work on the ground.</p><p>Over our 20 years of work to foster greater health and well-being, we helped establish the Penny George Institute for Health and Healing at Allina Health, the George Wellbeing Center at Greater Twin Cities YMCA, and the Catalyst Initiative (now with the Minneapolis Foundation). We are also longtime supporters of the Center for Health and Healing at the University of Minnesota.</p><p>The idea that clinical care should treat the whole person rather than just their disease and that people should be supported to be the principal agent of their own health are concepts that have gradually gained traction over the past 20 years. We are pleased to have played a part in that shift.</p><p>We support many educational fellowships at Harvard, Georgia Tech, World Economic Forum, and other institutions and have recently created a True North leadership program at 1440 Multiversity in California and a women’s leadership program at Duke University.</p><p><em>This content was originally published on <a href=\"http://tcbmag.com/news/articles/2019/january/leaders-in-giving-people\">Twin Cities Business</a> on 12/24/18.</em></p><em>This content was originally published on <a href=\"http://tcbmag.com/news/articles/2019/january/leaders-in-giving-people\">Twin Cities Business</a> on 12/24/18.</em><a href=\"http://tcbmag.com/news/articles/2019/january/leaders-in-giving-people\">Twin Cities Business</a><div></div>"

I anticipate that within a couple of years, GSK will acquire the remaining 32 percent of the Pfizer venture, which will be run by GSK’s current consumer head, Brian McNamara. For its pharmaceutical business, GSK can focus on drug discovery. The same goes for Pfizer’s pharmaceutical businesses.</p><p>With their new focus, I anticipate that both pharmaceutical companies will be active on the acquisition front in seeking new compounds, existing drugs, and smaller biopharmaceutical companies. The question remains as to whether they can compete in their own drug discovery labs with well-established biopharmaceutical research centers like Merck, Novartis and Roche.</p><p>Under the new leadership of CEO Larry Culp, GE is also moving rapidly to focus its business as well.

GE shareholders immediately signaled their approval of Culp’s moves, increasing its stock price 5 percent in spite of broadly-based declines on Thursday in response to the Fed’s interest rate increase. GSK, whose stock had risen 7 percent in response to its announcements, wound up the day on the plus side of the ledger as well.</p><p>The question remains, will these announcements trigger further focus on the rest of the health care sector? Under the leadership of new CEO Vas Narasimhan, Novartis has already moved aggressively to focus on its biopharmaceutical business by spinning off Alcon, its eye care business, and the remainder of its GSK venture and acquiring three major new biopharma technologies — gene therapy, cell therapy and radioligand therapy.</p><p>The other majors are also continuing to examine their portfolios as well. Fewer divestitures are expected among the medical technology companies like Medtronic, Stryker and Boston Scientific that are already highly focused on their portfolios, but more consolidation may be anticipated within that industry.</p><p>The shift to greater focus in their strategies will enable these health care giants to concentrate on the rapidly advancing technological opportunities and to excel in their respective fields with increased market shares, more efficient use of assets, and increased returns to shareholders. Their investors have already signaled that this is precisely what they want.</p><p><em>Bill George is a senior fellow at Harvard Business School, former chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic and the author of “Discover Your True North.” George served on the board of Novartis until 2009, but he doesn’t currently hold any shares in the company or any of the other companies mentioned in this column.

      "<p>Bakken was always two decades ahead of his time, causing many people to doubt his ideas, but he never wavered, Bill George writes.</p><p>Earl Bakken’s death on Oct. 21 at his beloved Hawaii home sent reverberations back to Minnesota. He leaves behind a powerful legacy that will impact Minnesotans for generations to come.</p><p>Having known Earl for 35 years, I was always amazed by the clarity of his vision and his passion to see it realized. From age 8 to his death at 94, he focused on his “high tech, high touch” vision for medicine.</p><p>Fascinated by Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein,” he used electricity inside the body to enable healing that allowed people to live a full life. His invention of the world’s first wearable, battery-powered pacemaker in 1957 launched the entire medical-technology industry, which has grown to $400 billion worldwide.</p><p>Earl was always two decades ahead of his time, causing many people to doubt his ideas, but he never wavered. In the early 1960s he crafted his “100-year plan for Medtronic,” which showed all the areas of the human body that electrical implants could enable healing from chronic disease. Sixty years later with $30 billion in annual revenue, Medtronic remains focused on Earl’s original vision.</p><p>Earl was a strong believer in healing the whole person — mind, body and spirit. In the 1970s he had an artist render “the rising man” coming off the operating table and walking away to full life. He used to tell us, “Our job is not to implant more pacemakers but to restore people to full life and health. Until that person is fully restored, our job isn’t done.”</p><p>In 1960, he wrote the now-famous Medtronic Mission, not one word of which has been altered 58 years later. The mission has guided Medtronic and inspired its employees, its customers, its investors and its communities throughout these years. Its impact on the business world is even more powerful today as the business world shifts from maximizing shareholder returns to mission-driven companies that have a positive impact on society while creating wealth for their employees, customers and shareholders.</p><p>Because he felt so strongly about the importance of his vision and associated initiatives, Earl was conscious of leaving a legacy that would carry on long after his death. He envisioned that legacy through the Medtronic Mission and its leaders who would carry it out, Medtronic traditions like the Mission and Medallion Ceremony (known as M&amp;M), and the holiday party. He also created living legacies through the Bakken Museum of science, electricity and medical technology; the Pavek Museum of vintage radio and television equipment; and the North Hawaii Community Hospital he founded in 1995 to create holistic health care combining Eastern and Western medicine.</p><p>I will never forget my first discussion with Earl about joining Medtronic in 1989. We met for dinner in a small hotel in Phoenix. In three hours he never asked me about my qualifications; rather he spent the evening sharing the Medtronic Mission and values, and assessing whether I was prepared to buy into them. In our first meeting after joining the company that May, he asked me to attend his M&amp;M ceremony. I’ll always remember his words when he gave me my medallion, “Bill, put this on your desk as a reminder of why we work here, especially when you get discouraged or frustrated. Remember you are here to restore people to full life and health, not just to make money for yourself or the company.”</p><p>After his retirement in 1994, Earl moved to his new home in Hawaii but often returned to Minnesota to meet with company leaders and employees and to give M&amp;M ceremonies. Until three years ago, he came back every year to the holiday party to recognize the patients who were sharing their moving stories of how new Medtronic products transformed their lives.</p><p>Earl’s time with each new CEO has paid off. Omar Ishrak, who became CEO in 2011, is the strongest advocate for the mission I have ever heard. When the company was acquiring Covidien for nearly $50 billion, he insisted that first the deal had to conform to every one of the mission’s six key points. This paid off as 40,000 new employees were successfully integrated into the Medtronic culture.</p><p>Earl Bakken’s life is a testimony to the words of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s “Psalm of Life”:</p><div>\n<p class=\"Text_Body\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"Text_Italic\">Lives of great men all remind us</span></p>\n<div id=\"zdt_187188_1_wrapper_12\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"></div>\n<p class=\"Text_Body\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"Text_Italic\">We can make our lives sublime,</span></p>\n<div id=\"zdt_187188_1_wrapper_13\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"></div>\n<p class=\"Text_Body\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"Text_Italic\">And, departing, leave behind us</span></p>\n<div id=\"zdt_187188_1_wrapper_14\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"></div>\n<p class=\"Text_Body\" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><span class=\"Text_Italic\">Footprints on the sands of time.</span></p>\n<div id=\"zdt_187188_1_wrapper_16\"></div>\n<p class=\"Text_Body\">Earl Bakken’s greatest legacy will be in his giant footprints that will enable tens of millions of people to heal from chronic disease.

      "<p>“Earl Bakken was a man and a legend.” So wrote integrative medicine philanthropist&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.georgefamilyfoundation.org/about/board-and-staff/penny-george\">Penny George</a>&nbsp;in a e-note following news that the founder of the now&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.medtronic.com/us-en/index.html\">$27-billion Medtronic</a>&nbsp;had died at 94 in his home on his beloved island of Hawaii. “Earl is also a testament to integrative care. He accumulated a number of serious health problems with which most people would not have lived that long. But he combined the benefit of the devices his company created with acupuncture and massage and a great diet and the power of meaning and purpose to live as long and as healthy a life as one could imagine.”</p><a href=\"http://www.georgefamilyfoundation.org/about/board-and-staff/penny-george\">Penny George</a><a href=\"http://www.medtronic.com/us-en/index.html\">$27-billion Medtronic</a><p>Bakken’s death stimulated a lengthy&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/earl-bakken-early-pacemaker-inventor-and-founder-of-medtronic-dies-at-94/2018/10/23/f71e61ce-d603-11e8-a10f-b51546b10756_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.4b53e6b899f8\">obituary in the Washington Post</a>&nbsp;that tells the remarkable story of the humble beginnings of this engineer and electronics repairman. The Post did not mention Bakken’s passion for integrative medicine that newspapers closer to his Hawaiian home featured in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/2018/10/23/hawaii-news/hawaii-island-remembers-dr-earl-bakken/\">their write-ups</a>. Bakken both lived and philanthropically promoted a vision for a blended, “high touch-high tech” medicine.</p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/earl-bakken-early-pacemaker-inventor-and-founder-of-medtronic-dies-at-94/2018/10/23/f71e61ce-d603-11e8-a10f-b51546b10756_story.html?noredirect=on&amp;utm_term=.4b53e6b899f8\">obituary in the Washington Post</a><a href=\"https://www.hawaiitribune-herald.com/2018/10/23/hawaii-news/hawaii-island-remembers-dr-earl-bakken/\">their write-ups</a><p>Over two decades ago, Bakken helped legitimize the field by making the vision of this new kind of integrative care into in a national exemplar. His creation of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.queens.org/north-hawaii/north-hawaii-community-hospital\">North Hawaii Community Hospital</a>&nbsp;in the mid-1990s drew news accounts from thousands of miles away. He melded an optimal healing environment design – before that concept was coined – with a natural setting, windows that opened to breezes, and multiple forward-thinking touches to assist patients and their families during the arduous times of hospitalization. To these Bakken sought to create clinical services that blended multiple natural healing modalities and professionals with regular treatment. He envisioned and had implemented, for example, an in-hospital natural products formulary.</p><a href=\"https://www.queens.org/north-hawaii/north-hawaii-community-hospital\">North Hawaii Community Hospital</a><p>Bakken’s fellow Big Island resident&nbsp;<a href=\"http://michaeltraubnd.com/\">Michael Traub, ND, FABNO</a>&nbsp;was given a lead role in developing the integrative practice part of the hospital’s services, and the green pharmacy that would support it. Traub, who was also a part of Bakken’s personal care team for many years, including at the end of life, reflects on how the inventor “touched hundreds of thousands of people with his high tech and high touch – his example inspires similar numbers of us who knew him and who work in health care to broaden our reach and influence beyond those in our immediate circle.”</p><a href=\"http://michaeltraubnd.com/\">Michael Traub, ND, FABNO</a><p>Traub has shared elsewhere that Bakken’s integrative services vision proved to be ahead of the mindsets of much of the medical staff at the hospital in the mid-1990s. Implementation of the integrative model was slowed. Contacted for this article, Traub shared a poignant recent moment: “I will always remember his last words to me:&nbsp; ‘You look like you have so much joy in your heart.’&nbsp; My reply was, ‘So do you Earl, so do you.’”</p><p>Through Traub, in 2005 Bakken became one of the two most significant philanthropic partners of a founding interprofessional event for the emerging integrative health and medicine field, the 12-discipline&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ihpc.org/wp-content/uploads/NEDPR.pdf\">National Education Dialogue to Advance Integrated Care: Creating Common Ground</a>. As a principal in that initiative, I had a chance to meet with Bakken in his home office. I received from him a copy of his autobiography that tells his extraordinary story. One could feel how the spirit of the islands seemed to surround and infuse him.</p><a href=\"http://www.ihpc.org/wp-content/uploads/NEDPR.pdf\">National Education Dialogue to Advance Integrated Care: Creating Common Ground</a><p>While the Big Island was his main home at the end of his life, he maintained strong ties to his Minnesota roots where Medtronic is based. Philanthropist Penny George, whose spouse Bill George guided Medtronic to huge growth after Bakken stepped down, spoke of Bakken’s contributions to his home city:</p><p>“He created an industry that sustains Minnesota to this day, as well as a singular company that restores people to full lives every second. He was a visionary decades ahead of his time who was wise enough to pass on leadership of that company to those who could take it to the next level. Till he retired and moved to Hawaii, he met with every employee (including Bill when he was hired as COO), to impress upon them the importance of their serving the mission. He always ended by handing out the Medtronic medallion printed with the mission. His was a life well lived.”</p><p>That city was also the home to one of the longest-running integrative centers in the United States which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.integrativepractitioner.com/topics/news/minnesota-center-for-spirituality-re-named-to-honor-integrative-visionary\">in 2017</a>&nbsp;became known as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.csh.umn.edu/\">Earl E. Bakken Center for Spirituality and Healing</a>. Center founder and director&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.csh.umn.edu/bio/center-for-spirituality-and-he/maryjo-kreitzer\">Mary Jo Kreitzer, RN, PhD, FAAN&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;offered a portrait of a man with “a love for humanity that had no bounds and an insatiable curiosity.” She shared this personal account of being mentored by Bakken:</p><a href=\"https://www.integrativepractitioner.com/topics/news/minnesota-center-for-spirituality-re-named-to-honor-integrative-visionary\">in 2017</a><a href=\"https://www.csh.umn.edu/\">Earl E. Bakken Center for Spirituality and Healing</a><a href=\"https://www.csh.umn.edu/bio/center-for-spirituality-and-he/maryjo-kreitzer\">Mary Jo Kreitzer, RN, PhD, FAAN&nbsp;</a><p>“Very early in the Center’s history, Earl’s office contacted me and said he wanted to&nbsp;meet with me to learn more about the Center. I had no idea what to expect in this&nbsp;encounter and was more than a little anxious. I recall that Earl was less interested&nbsp;in hearing about what we were doing and intending to do at the Center and was&nbsp;more interested in getting to know who I was as a person. This was the beginning of&nbsp;a deep friendship and mentoring relationship that has spanned over two decades.</p><p>“As I reflect on our relationship, I am struck by several things. Earl asked many&nbsp;questions, but never told me what he thought we should be doing. He opened the&nbsp;door for me to have experiences, but never attempted to control the outcome of&nbsp;what might happen. He urged me to read widely and glean insights from many&nbsp;different fields. It was not unusual to enter his office and see a large stack of&nbsp;journals with sticky notes protruding, highlighting articles that he wanted to talk&nbsp;about and thought I should read. He was a conscientious curator of all that was&nbsp;happening in the world, and brought my attention to ideas that I should be aware of.&nbsp;Many times, I had the experience of discovering – months or years later – why he&nbsp;wanted me to learn about something. What deeply touches me as I reflect on this is&nbsp;the way that he invested in my learning and success. He cared about the Center and&nbsp;about me as a person. What is remarkable is the everyday occurrence this was in&nbsp;Earl’s life. He undoubtedly mentored hundreds and hundreds of people.”</p><p>Penny George shares an intimate story from her relationship with Bakken: “When I was first diagnosed with breast cancer, I remember that he sent me a bunch of books. Doris, his wife, had been diagnosed a bit earlier than me and I remember he encouraged her to deal with it through surgery but then lifestyle medicine (macrobiotic diet, etc.) instead of chemo. He opened my eyes to the fact that chemo was not essential. I decided to do chemo anyway since it was not the most harsh kind but really put my attention on the lifestyle factors ever since. Doris, by the way, is doing fine.” (Bakken is survived by his spouse.)</p><p>Medtronic, with its 6-pronged&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.medtronic.com/us-en/about/mission.html\">mission</a>&nbsp;that Bakken established, to “alleviate pain, restore health, and extend life” – and with its call to “recognize the personal worth of employees” and to be a “good citizen” balancing a focus on “a fair profit” – presently has 86,000 employees worldwide. The Medtronic&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.medtronic.com/us-en/index.html\">website is a compelling altar</a>&nbsp;to Bakken and his contributions.</p><a href=\"http://www.medtronic.com/us-en/about/mission.html\">mission</a><a href=\"http://www.medtronic.com/us-en/index.html\">website is a compelling altar</a><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://www.johnweeks-integrator.com/uncategorized/integrative-health-philanthropist-earl-bakken-bids-adieu-at-94/\">JohnWeeks-Integrator</a> on 10/26/18.&nbsp;</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://www.johnweeks-integrator.com/uncategorized/integrative-health-philanthropist-earl-bakken-bids-adieu-at-94/\">JohnWeeks-Integrator</a> on 10/26/18.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.johnweeks-integrator.com/uncategorized/integrative-health-philanthropist-earl-bakken-bids-adieu-at-94/\">JohnWeeks-Integrator</a><div></div>"

      "<h1>Bill Takes Aim at Directors, Corporate Governance</h1><p>Companies in the United States and their directors are fixated on one thing, according to Senator&nbsp;<b>Elizabeth Warren</b>&nbsp;(D-Mass.): maximizing shareholder returns to the detriment of other stakeholders in the company. To address this, Warren recently introduced a bill that would require directors to consider all major stakeholders, not just shareholders, when making company decisions.</p><b>Elizabeth Warren</b><p>As is, the bill is unlikely to become law, sources say, but Warren’s proposal to overhaul the way certain companies in the United States operate highlights some of the major issues currently facing companies, and according to some, it may have an impact on corporate governance discussions and decisions made within companies.</p><p>And it may also serve as a critique of boards of directors, says&nbsp;<b>Douglas Chia</b>, executive director of the governance center for&nbsp;<b>The Conference Board</b>. “She basically wants to strip [those at the decision-making table] of certain powers that they have or impose certain requirements on them,” he says. “That’s a direct criticism of corporate boards.”</p><b>Douglas Chia</b><b>The Conference Board</b><p>Warren’s bill, the Accountable Capitalism Act, would require companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue to get a federal corporate charter that mandates that directors consider interests of all major stakeholders. The bill also stipulates that at least 40% of all directors would be elected by employees and at least 75% of directors and shareholders would have to approve political expenditures.</p><div><blockimg class=\"CToWUd a6T aligncenter\" tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ifYpzIUGAETAPqc_vnWJHCVAi7i_Cb7YWDUt3Bi1W-Yg4ObOZR0je00c2D_vAcPA50rEGmdVJhKQyVCArGx0A5qMHFiSh03dfhBxivqC5LpAC-LF2sDd9A4nri1JmqJzWVLKqgTO=s0-d-e1-ft#https://d2vrmg9uk4ynh8.cloudfront.net/prod1/542613/CMS_5-091718_Agenda_issue.png\"></blockimg></div><blockimg tabindex=\"0\" src=\"https://ci6.googleusercontent.com/proxy/ifYpzIUGAETAPqc_vnWJHCVAi7i_Cb7YWDUt3Bi1W-Yg4ObOZR0je00c2D_vAcPA50rEGmdVJhKQyVCArGx0A5qMHFiSh03dfhBxivqC5LpAC-LF2sDd9A4nri1JmqJzWVLKqgTO=s0-d-e1-ft#https://d2vrmg9uk4ynh8.cloudfront.net/prod1/542613/CMS_5-091718_Agenda_issue.png\"></blockimg><p>In a&nbsp;<i>Wall Street Journal</i>&nbsp;op-ed, Warren said that, while companies once recognized obligations to several stakeholders, that idea was replaced by the view that directors are required solely to maximize shareholder returns. She also criticized equity-based compensation, which she argued feeds into the desire to focus too much on shareholder returns.</p><i>Wall Street Journal</i><p>“For the past 30 years we have put the American stamp of approval on giant corporations, even as they have ignored the interests of all but a tiny slice of Americans,” Warren wrote in the&nbsp;<i>Journal.</i>&nbsp;“We should insist on a new deal.”</p><i>Journal.</i><p><b>Governance Overhaul?</b></p><b>Governance Overhaul?</b><p>The ideas underlying Warren’s bill are not necessarily novel, but in a blog post published not long after she announced it,&nbsp;<b>Martin Lipton</b>, a founding partner of&nbsp;<b>Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz</b>, speculated that the proposal would have a definite impact. Lipton, who pointed back to his post when asked for an interview, likened Warren’s proposal to previous efforts by&nbsp;<b>Ralph Nader</b>&nbsp;to require federal incorporation of companies.</p><b>Martin Lipton</b><b>Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz</b><b>Ralph Nader</b><p>“Warren’s proposal should not receive any more support than Nader’s,” wrote Lipton. “However, like Nader’s proposal led to significant changes in environment regulation, Warren’s will likely lead to major changes to the relationship between corporations and the institutional investors and asset managers who control them.” Lipton added in a second post that, while he is a proponent of stakeholder corporate governance, he believes federalization of large companies is “too high a price to pay.”</p><p>But not all expect sweeping changes.&nbsp;<b>William George</b>, senior fellow at&nbsp;<b>Harvard Business School</b>&nbsp;and director on the&nbsp;<b>Goldman Sachs Group</b>&nbsp;board, says he imagines a more muted impact focused on discussion of the issues.</p><b>William George</b><b>Harvard Business School</b><b>Goldman Sachs Group</b><p>In particular, the bill highlights a concern that companies are too focused on short-term goals, which George agrees is detrimental to a company. Countless hours are expended in the name of quarterly filings, distracting management from longer-term goals, he says, and so this and other recent events, such as President&nbsp;<b>Donald Trump</b>’s tweet announcing that he’d asked the&nbsp;<b>SEC</b>&nbsp;to consider an end to quarterly reporting, will the discussion.</p><b>Donald Trump</b><b>SEC</b><p>Meanwhile, some say the proposal is likely to have no impact, whatsoever.</p><p>“Not only does the bill have no chance of passing, its likelihood of having any impact on corporate governance is close to zero,”<b>Lawrence Cunningham</b>, a law professor at&nbsp;<b>George Washington University</b>&nbsp;who regularly advises and serves on corporate boards, writes in an e-mail. “[A]nd it’s a good thing too,” he adds, pointing out that a federal corporate chartering system would bring with it the risk of “infecting corporate life” with federal politics and lobbying.</p><b>Lawrence Cunningham</b><b>George Washington University</b><p>Regardless of the impact of the proposal, sources agree that more regulation and, in particular, the Accountable Capitalism Act, is not the answer to the issues laid out by Warren and others.</p><p>For one, George contends that federalizing corporations would be an “enormous mistake.” What’s more, he says that having employees elect a certain percentage of directors would create a two-tiered board in which directors elected the traditional way largely operate, and make decisions, separately from the rest of the directors. George says he previously served on the board of a French company with a similar structure, and “it was a façade.”</p><p>“It doesn’t work at all,” says George, who previously served as chairman and CEO of&nbsp;<b>Medtronic</b>. “I believe very strongly that every board director must represent the company and its shareholders. I do not think that we should have representative directors.”</p><b>Medtronic</b><p>George acknowledges that focusing exclusively on maximizing shareholder returns to the detriment of other stakeholders is the “death knell for a company.” But, he says, successful companies already make full stakeholder concerns a priority.</p><p>This would make sense, given the attention focused on the idea that company decision makers should be driven by more than shareholder returns. In his letter to chief executive officers earlier this year, for instance,&nbsp;<b>BlackRock</b>&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;<b>Larry Fink</b>&nbsp;noted that that companies “must benefit all of their stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate,” otherwise they will “lose their license to operate from key stakeholders.”</p><b>BlackRock</b><b>Larry Fink</b><p>And in fact, as Warren points out in her op-ed, more than 30 states have authorized so-called “benefit corporations,” which require directors and officers to consider the impact of their decisions on stakeholders such as employees and customers, as well as on shareholders.</p><p>The key difference between what states have done and Warren’s bill is choice,&nbsp;<b>Haskell Murray</b>, associate professor of management and business law at&nbsp;<b>Belmont University</b>, points out in an e-mail. For years, there has been more of a focus on companies’ social responsibility, and whether or not future governance changes stem from Warren’s proposal, ongoing movements or some combination of the two, Murray notes the Accountable Capitalism Act is giving the concept of social business an elevated platform.</p><b>Haskell Murray</b><b>Belmont University</b><p>Murray adds, however, that his concern is the bill may also “make the social business movement more partisan.” He points to a recent&nbsp;<i>Forbes</i>&nbsp;article from&nbsp;<b>Jay Coen Gilbert</b>, co-founder of B Lab, who, in reaction to Warren’s proposal, wrote that in the 34 states that have authorized benefit corporations, both Republican and Democrat governors have signed the legislation into law.</p><i>Forbes</i><b>Jay Coen Gilbert</b><p>Allowing businesses to opt in (as is the case in the 34 states), versus mandating governance changes for certain companies, may make all the difference. “While the social benefit movement has leaned left overall, I think the support that benefit corporation legislation has received on the right rests on the fact that it is a free market solution to social ills,” Murray writes. “Under existing state benefit corporation law, the socially-focused governance model is voluntarily adopted. In contrast, Senator Warren’s proposal is mandatory for the covered large companies.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>This content was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.agendaweek.com/c/2079853/246143/bill_takes_directors_corporate_governance\">Agendaweek.com</a> on 9/17.&nbsp;</em></p><em>This content was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.agendaweek.com/c/2079853/246143/bill_takes_directors_corporate_governance\">Agendaweek.com</a> on 9/17.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.agendaweek.com/c/2079853/246143/bill_takes_directors_corporate_governance\">Agendaweek.com</a><div></div>"

      "<p>For any leader at any level in any organization, clarity of purpose is a critical ingredient of success. In other words, you must know where you’re headed and why you’re headed there.</p><p>A compass provides the ideal metaphor. Just as a compass points toward a magnetic field, your personal “true north” directs your path and pulls you forward.</p><p>That’s the thesis of&nbsp;<em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2w8vtHm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://amzn.to/2w8vtHm\">Discover Your True North</a></em>&nbsp;by Bill George.</p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2w8vtHm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://amzn.to/2w8vtHm\">Discover Your True North</a></em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2w8vtHm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-ga-track=\"ExternalLink:https://amzn.to/2w8vtHm\">Discover Your True North</a><p>George is so much more than a mere theorist. He’s been in the trenches and understands the nuances of leadership practices. He started his career in the U.S. Department of Defense, then served in senior executive positions at Honeywell and Litton Industries. George was later president and chairman at Medtronic, one of the world’s largest medical equipment and development companies. He’s served on boards at ExxonMobile, Novartis, Target, and the Mayo Clinic. Today he teaches leadership at the Harvard Business School.</p><p><strong>Rodger Dean Duncan:&nbsp;</strong>You write about “authentic” leadership. What is it in our society that seems to cause people to equate “celebrity” with authenticity?</p><strong>Rodger Dean Duncan:&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Bill George:</strong>&nbsp;The media. The media play up celebrity in so many ways. Many of the media people themselves are turned into celebrities. Politicians attempt to be celebrities. The problem is that they’re more concerned about the external impressions they make than who they are inside. This is a very serious problem for leaders. In the 1990s the media got caught up with business celebrities and tried to turn a lot of business leaders into celebrities and—judging by all the financial crises we had—many of them did not do well. It’s more important to look at the person within and assess their leadership qualities based on who they are as individuals as they move into leadership roles.</p><strong>Bill George:</strong><p><strong>Duncan:</strong>&nbsp;I suspect that phenomenon affects people’s investment decisions, and that can be dangerous.</p><strong>Duncan:</strong><p><strong>George:</strong>&nbsp;Yes, particularly regarding mergers and acquisitions. Unfortunately, many people get drawn into doing acquisitions because of external pressures. They want to make a big hit or a big splash or a big impression.</p><strong>George:</strong><p><strong>Duncan:&nbsp;</strong>Doing what’s possibly a good thing but for the wrong reasons.</p><strong>Duncan:&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>George:</strong>&nbsp;Exactly. And you do get a lot of media attention when you do a big acquisition. Unfortunately, when some leaders can’t grow their businesses organically they start to look for ways to make a big splash with acquisitions.</p><strong>George:</strong><p><strong>Duncan:</strong>&nbsp;And we’ve all seen the statistics that show most acquisitions fail to measure up to the performance promised in the initial hype.</p><strong>Duncan:</strong><p><strong>George:</strong>&nbsp;Yes. They spent more time worrying about the price and projecting cost savings than they did in considering how the two cultures integrate and who will hold the leadership roles in the new organization.</p><strong>George:</strong><p><strong>Duncan:&nbsp;</strong>What are some of the more common things that influence people to lose their way—to lose sight of their True North?</p><strong>Duncan:&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>George:&nbsp;</strong>It’s when they get caught up with extrinsic motivations. The three great seducers are money, fame, and power.</p><strong>George:&nbsp;</strong><p>We saw this in the case of Rajat Gupta. He was an exceptional leader but made some big mistakes and went to jail for two years for insider trading. He got caught up in trying to go from being worth $120 million to a billion. He’s a good person. But this happens. And people get caught up in their status. Power-based leadership is almost like a drug and people can get addicted to it. Power is not the role of a leader. The leader’s true role is to empower others.</p><p><strong>Duncan:&nbsp;</strong>You say the dimensions of an authentic leader include Purpose, Values, Relationships, Self-Discipline, and Heart. Relationships certainly evolve over time, and a person’s self-discipline is like to improve with maturity. What about Purpose, Values, and Heart? How do those dimensions evolve?</p><strong>Duncan:&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>George:&nbsp;</strong>I think your purpose evolves from life experience. I think it’s very hard as a young person to go out and test yourself against the challenges of the real world and to know what your purpose is. I used to think that was first, but then I realized people really need to do a lot of inner work and understand their True North before they can ascertain their purpose. They must understand their life stories and the crucibles they’ve had. Clarity of purpose often emanates from those experiences.</p><strong>George:&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Duncan:</strong>&nbsp;It seems to me that some pretty solid values must be in place before an individual can even try to clarify his True North.</p><strong>Duncan:</strong><p><strong>George:&nbsp;</strong>That’s for sure. Your True North is based in the bedrock of your values. There’s no question about that. You must be grounded in the values that come out of your life story, your upbringing, what you believe, and how you relate to other people. Your values must be established early.</p><strong>George:&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Duncan:</strong>&nbsp;In the world of business and public life, who are some of today’s leaders you regard as demonstrating authenticity? Specifically, what do you see in them that’s worth emulating?</p><strong>Duncan:</strong><p><strong>George:&nbsp;</strong>I would cite someone like Paul Polman, CEO of Unilever. He’s been an exceptionally strong advocate for long-term value created through a multi-stakeholder model. He also advocates the role of sustainability in our products, in our environment, in our lives and in everything we do. He really stands out as a true authentic leader.</p><strong>George:&nbsp;</strong><p>Another is Indra Nooyi at PepsiCo. When she took over as CEO in 2006 she immediately established the company’s goal as being performance with purpose. She’s working to shift the company’s portfolio to more healthful foods and beverages.</p><p><strong>Duncan:&nbsp;</strong>You write about the transformation from “I” to “We” as being the most important process leaders go through in becoming authentic. What does that transformation look like in observable behaviors?</p><strong>Duncan:&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>George:&nbsp;</strong>Almost everything we do as young people is based on individual performance—whether it’s grades in school, how we do on tests, etc. Then we go to work and we get judged on individual performance. It’s important that we learn to look beyond that.</p><strong>George:&nbsp;</strong><p>Leadership is really about how we empower others, how we inspire them to perform at the top level. So we must make that journey from “I” to “We.” We must learn that people are not there to serve us. We are there to serve them. This shifts us from top-down leadership to collaborative leadership.</p><p>In the “I” model we try to get more power and position. In the “We” model we work to serve others. The “We” model is clearly more effective. With the “We” model, your leadership goes from directing other people to coaching and mentoring other people.</p><p><strong>Duncan:</strong>&nbsp;What role does self-awareness play in all this?</p><strong>Duncan:</strong><p><strong>George:&nbsp;</strong>Many leaders don’t have much self-awareness, and self-awareness is the core of authenticity—of knowing who you are and of knowing your True North. Clarity on your True North requires humility and learning from the crucibles you faced earlier in life. Self-awareness is the key to everything. It definitely can be developed, and leaders need to work on it through honest introspection and receiving honest feedback.</p><strong>George:&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Duncan:</strong>&nbsp;As my grandfather said, “Never turn down a breath mint. Feedback is a gift.”</p><strong>Duncan:</strong><p><strong>George:&nbsp;</strong>That’s certainly true, but some people don’t want feedback. And if you don’t want it you won’t get it. You can remain clueless and just do your own thing.</p><strong>George:&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Duncan:&nbsp;</strong>What are some good ways for a person to identify and confront his or her blind spots?</p><strong>Duncan:&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>George:&nbsp;</strong>Honest feedback, especially 360 feedback. Feedback from your boss can certainly be helpful, but feedback from your subordinates and peers can be especially valuable. They see you every day. They see the good, the bad, and the ugly. It’s important that you really listen to people trying to give you honest feedback. I’m a big believer in processes that provide written feedback on things that people may not wish to tell you in person.</p><strong>George:&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Duncan:&nbsp;</strong>What kind of support team is most helpful to leaders who genuinely want to be authentic in their behavior?</p><strong>Duncan:&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>George:</strong>&nbsp;Having a support team is supremely important. Having at least one person in your life with whom you can be totally open and honest and who will reciprocate is enormously helpful. For me, that’s my wife. It’s important to have someone who will pull you back down to earth if you’re getting too high on yourself and who can provide encouragement if you get too down on yourself.</p><strong>George:</strong><p>In addition to that, having good mentors is very helpful—people who will give you honest feedback we talked about earlier.</p><p>And third, it’s important to have a small group of people with whom you honestly share back and forth. I have a men’s group that has met every Wednesday morning for the past 42 years. There are eights guys in there. We also have a couples group that meets monthly on Sunday night. That kind of interaction is very essential to me.</p><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rodgerdeanduncan/2018/09/01/discover-your-true-north/#7db3f0646988\">Forbes.com</a> on 9/1/2018.&nbsp;</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rodgerdeanduncan/2018/09/01/discover-your-true-north/#7db3f0646988\">Forbes.com</a> on 9/1/2018.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/rodgerdeanduncan/2018/09/01/discover-your-true-north/#7db3f0646988\">Forbes.com</a><div></div>"

Funding secured.”</p><p>After a flurry of activity with bankers, investors and the Tesla board, Musk announced last Friday that he had changed his mind and Tesla would continue to be a public company.</p><p>All this investor focus has been a giant diversion from Tesla’s real problems. In fact, Tesla’s investors have been its biggest supporters, running its market valuation to $53 billion, higher than either General Motors ($52 billion) or Ford ($40 billion). Meanwhile, Tesla continues to lose billions of dollars with a dwindling cash balance.</p><p>In the recent past Musk has lost 40 key executives, including his heads of product development (Doug Field), sales and marketing (Jon McNeill) and finance (Susan Repo), plus Solar City’s Peter Rive and Lyndon Rive. As a result, Musk is trying to do it all himself, even sleeping at the factory to try to get the Model 3 up and running.</p><p>No one can run a big company like Tesla alone. Leading a global automobile business is an extremely complex task requiring a strong, diverse team of executive leaders at all levels. Building the top team is precisely what Mary Barra has done in restoring&nbsp;<a class=\"inline_quotes\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GM\" data-gdsid=\"75973\" data-inline-quote-symbol=\"GM\">General Motors</a>&nbsp;following its 2009 emergence from bankruptcy. That’s what Alan Mulally did to lead&nbsp;<a class=\"inline_quotes\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=F\" data-gdsid=\"17077\" data-inline-quote-symbol=\"F\">Ford</a>&nbsp;through the 2008-09 recession.</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GM\" data-gdsid=\"75973\" data-inline-quote-symbol=\"GM\">General Motors</a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=F\" data-gdsid=\"17077\" data-inline-quote-symbol=\"F\">Ford</a><p>The playbook that Barra and Mulally each used fostered teamwork, promoted healthy collaboration and created cohesion around one team implementing one plan for the entire company’s success.</p><p>Musk should stop worrying about beating the short sellers and focus entirely on rebuilding Tesla’s depleted leadership ranks. Most importantly, he should recruit a partner with extensive automobile experience to run the business on a day-to-day business.</p><p>An ideal candidate would be Mark Fields, who was CEO of Ford from 2014 to 2017 and who has been in the auto business for 29 years. With his vast knowledge of the business and his proven leadership capabilities, Fields in turn can recruit top performers from auto companies all over the world to get Tesla’s operations back on track.</p><p>In addition, Tesla needs a very strong CFO who can put the company’s finances in order. That means stopping the cash drain and getting the company profitable. Doing so will require correcting Tesla’s rampant operational problems, getting Model 3 production up and running and bringing down the cost of its vehicles.</p><p>Finally, the Tesla board needs to be upgraded to provide wisdom and insights to Musk and his team about the intricacies of the global automobile business. Tesla’s current board consists of Musk, his brother, the former CFO of Tesla’s Solar City acquisition, three venture capitalists, the COO of Telstra and James Murdoch, CEO of Twenty-First Century Fox. None of these board members has any experience in the automobile business.</p><p>Tesla should add two to three experienced executives who understand the business and can advise management as Tesla ramps up and prepares for the next generation of vehicles.</p><p>Elon Musk is often compared to Steve Jobs, an equally brilliant entrepreneur with the vision and drive to creative transformative products. Jobs was forced out by the&nbsp;<a class=\"inline_quotes\" href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAPL\" data-gdsid=\"8016\" data-inline-quote-symbol=\"AAPL\">Apple</a>&nbsp;board in 1985 for his erratic behavior. While he was building Pixar, he learned a great deal about leadership from two extraordinary innovation leaders, Ed Catmull and John Lasseter.

That is all true. But the real losers in this “America First” initiative will be American consumers. If President Trump follows through on his threats, U.S. consumers will see rapid rises in the prices of everything from T-shirts to automobiles to new homes.</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">President Donald Trump’s&nbsp;</a><p>Ever since President Ronald Reagan and Paul Volcker’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/federal-reserve/\">Federal Reserve&nbsp;</a>tamed the great inflation of the late 1970s – when prices and interest rates skyrocketed to 18 to 20 percent per year – American consumers have enjoyed 35 years of low inflation and low interest rates. Beyond the Federal Reserve Bank’s skillful monetary management, two major factors have driven this favorable economic scenario: globalization and technology.</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/federal-reserve/\">Federal Reserve&nbsp;</a><p>Let’s start with technology. Moore’s Law, which predicted the doubling of computer power every two years, has enabled today’s consumers to benefit from exponential increases in computing power. The capability of a typical smart phone far exceeds the capability of the supercomputers of the 1980s—and the cost of such power has fallen tremendously too. Similarly, advances in integrated circuits have increased electronic capabilities while lowering the cost of everything from television sets to pacemakers. Meanwhile, the tech industry has created millions of new jobs.</p><p>On the globalization front, relatively free trade has enabled consumers to purchase myriad products at much lower prices. Go to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT\">Walmart&nbsp;</a>and look at a sample of products and where they are made: China, Indonesia, Mexico, Korea, and the like. Stop by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=BBY\">Best Buy</a>&nbsp;and see where the television sets, mobile phones, laptop computers and watches are produced. These imports have drastically cut the cost of consumer goods for American consumers. This has given American consumers a much higher standard of living in a time of limited wage growth. In turn, consumer purchases have fueled the growth of the American economy.</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=WMT\">Walmart&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=BBY\">Best Buy</a><p>The combination of technology and globalization has also had a negative impact on certain labor-intensive industries like textiles, steel, and shoes. But these industries are not bringing their manufacturing jobs back to America. The solution for these dislocations does not lie in trade wars, but rather in retraining the American workforce for jobs of the future that require new and greater skills.</p><p>Trump’s trade war threatens to reverse this favorable 35-year interest-inflation moderation.</p><p><strong>Higher prices already happening</strong></p><strong>Higher prices already happening</strong><p>As the result of the U.S. imposing tariffs on $48 billion of imported steel and aluminum, American manufacturers and consumers are already seeing much higher prices on end products. Sen.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/07/20/sen-heitkamp-we-have-to-be-concerned-over-whats-happening-with-trade.html\">Heidi Heitkamp told CNBC</a>&nbsp;on Friday that the benefits of President Donald Trump’s tax cuts have already been negated as a result of his steel and aluminum tariffs.</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/07/20/sen-heitkamp-we-have-to-be-concerned-over-whats-happening-with-trade.html\">Heidi Heitkamp told CNBC</a><p>Now the President is threatening tariffs on $351 billion of imported automobiles and auto parts. The entire automotive value chain – manufacturers, suppliers, dealers and the UAW – is united in its concern about the harm auto tariffs will bring. The highly respected Peterson Institute for International Economics predicts these tariffs will&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/18/heres-how-much-your-next-car-could-cost-if-trump-auto-tariffs-go-thro.html\">increase the cost of automobiles</a>&nbsp;by $1,400 to $7,000. These are price increases that American consumers can ill afford. Inevitably, they will result in fewer vehicles being sold, causing hundreds of thousands of American auto workers to lose their jobs. This too will hurt the purchasing power of American consumers.</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/18/heres-how-much-your-next-car-could-cost-if-trump-auto-tariffs-go-thro.html\">increase the cost of automobiles</a><p>There is no doubt that the U.S. has legitimate complaints about protection of its intellectual property rights and the barriers China erects to doing business in China. But trying to intimidate the Chinese is not the way to conduct negotiations. On Friday, President Trump told CNBC,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/19/trump-says-hes-ready-to-put-tariffs-on-all-505-billion-of-chinese-.html\">“I’m ready to go to 500,”</a>&nbsp;meaning he is willing to impose tariffs on all $505 billion of Chinese imports. He also criticized the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, saying, “I’m not happy about it.”</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/19/trump-says-hes-ready-to-put-tariffs-on-all-505-billion-of-chinese-.html\">“I’m ready to go to 500,”</a><p><strong>‘Trigger a recession’</strong></p><strong>‘Trigger a recession’</strong><p>Escalating the U.S.-initiated trade war with the Chinese will trigger significant increases in consumer prices of all imported Chinese products and components used by U.S. manufacturers, further harming American consumers. These price increases may trigger a new inflationary spiral, causing the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates faster. There is a reasonable probability that the combination of inflation and higher interest rates will throw the U.S. economy off its current growth trajectory and may even trigger a recession.</p><p>It would be the height of naivete to believe that the Chinese, Europeans, Canadians and Mexicans will sit idly while the U.S. imposes tariffs on their exports to America. Already their retaliatory actions are hurting U.S. farmers and causing manufacturers like American-icon&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HOG\">Harley Davidson</a>&nbsp;to lay off American workers as it moves production off shore. U.S. and foreign automobile companies are preparing to follow suit. Meanwhile, America’s relationships with its long-standing trading partners are in shambles. The negative consequences are just beginning.</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=HOG\">Harley Davidson</a><p>Meanwhile, the Trump administration remains in denial about the potential harm of U.S.-levied tariffs. Speaking at the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires, U.S. Treasury Secretary&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/steven-mnuchin/\">Steven Mnuchin</a>&nbsp;said Saturday the U.S. economy has not been harmed by the trade battles. During his CNBC interview on Friday, President Trump said, “<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/07/20/trump-were-playing-with-the-banks-money-on-markets-gain-since-election-to-fight-trade-war.html\">We’re playing with the bank’s money.</a>”</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/steven-mnuchin/\">Steven Mnuchin</a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2018/07/20/trump-were-playing-with-the-banks-money-on-markets-gain-since-election-to-fight-trade-war.html\">We’re playing with the bank’s money.</a><p>President Trump is betting that these tariffs will cause the Chinese and other nations to capitulate to the U.S. That belief defies credibility. Chinese President Xi Jinping, who was recently made “president for life,” is not likely to back down. Much more probable are severe restrictions on the Chinese operations of America’s global-leading companies like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAPL\">Apple</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GM\">General Motors</a>&nbsp;in their Chinese operations, as Apple generates 21% of its revenues in China, while GM sells more automobiles in China than it does in the U.S.</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=AAPL\">Apple</a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GM\">General Motors</a><p>Many business leaders and stock investors are betting that the President is bluffing, and will back away from his threats. Thus far, President Trump shows no signs of doing so. Rather, he seems to think the trade wars are helping him politically. That’s a dangerous bet. Populist rhetoric may resonate in the short-term, but the economy is actually the most reliable barometer of election results.</p><p>Meanwhile, American consumers will be the ones to be harmed this high-stakes global game.</p><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/23/bill-george-if-trump-follows-through-on-tariffs-consumers-will-pay.html\">CNBC.com</a> on 7/23/18.</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/23/bill-george-if-trump-follows-through-on-tariffs-consumers-will-pay.html\">CNBC.com</a> on 7/23/18.</em><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2018/07/23/bill-george-if-trump-follows-through-on-tariffs-consumers-will-pay.html\">CNBC.com</a><div></div>"

Now, we have a new exemplar: Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson.</p>\n<p>His response to the eviction of two African American men from a Starbucks store in Philadelphia will define for today’s leaders how to respond to crisis. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who struggled from repeated missteps in Facebook’s current data privacy crisis, could learn a lot from Johnson.</p>\n<p>Let’s examine how Johnson and Zuckerberg measured up against what I have identified as&nbsp;<a class=\"ext\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lessons-Leading-Crisis-Bill-George/dp/0470531878\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>#1: Face reality, starting with yourself.&nbsp;</strong>Johnson realized immediately that, as Starbucks’ new CEO, he had to take the lead. He understood the incident’s implications went well beyond the specifics, triggering widespread concerns about racial bias in the country and threatening to damage Starbucks’ image as a safe, friendly place to gather with friends or work alone. In contrast, Zuckerberg characterized Facebook’s issue as a political problem and tried to shift the blame to Cambridge Analytica’s bad actors for violating Facebook’s rules for application developers. He ignored the deeper problem that Facebook users want privacy for their personal information.</p>\n<p><strong>#2: Use your teammates.&nbsp;</strong>Johnson had the full support of founder Howard Schultz and his team in Philadelphia. Zuckerberg did not seem to rely upon the wisdom of Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg or lead board director Susan Desmond-Hellmann. Instead, he trotted out his deputy legal counsel at a town hall meeting for all Facebook employees after four days, sending the message that he thought this was a legal problem rather than an issue of consumer trust.</p>\n<blockquote><p>“JOHNSON’S ACTIONS WILL BECOME THE NEW MODEL FOR HOW A CRISIS SHOULD BE HANDLED”</p></blockquote>\n<p><strong>#3: Dig deep for the root cause.&nbsp;</strong>Johnson perceived that not all his employees understood the deeper issues of racial bias, so he announced on the second day that Starbucks would close 8,000 stores on May 29 to train all 175,000 US employees about unconscious bias. Zuckerberg failed to acknowledge that the root cause of the data privacy scandal was its model of allowing developers to build their applications around user preferences—without explicit permission from the users themselves. (Zuckerberg says this is not the same as selling user information.&nbsp;<a class=\"ext\" href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40554491/zuckerberg-keeps-insisting-facebook-doesnt-sell-our-data-what-it-does-is-even-worse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You be the judge</a>.)</p>\n<p><strong>#4: Get ready for the long haul.&nbsp;</strong>Johnson’s planned training sessions demonstrated his commitment to ensure all employees are dedicated to making its stores safe, friendly, and welcoming for everyone. Zuckerberg said that he had known about the Cambridge Analytica problems since 2015 but wouldn’t acknowledge he had failed to correct them. Nor has he announced plans to do so now. This issue will plague Facebook for years before trust can rebuilt with users.</p>\n<p><strong>#5: Never waste a good crisis.&nbsp;</strong>By immediately flying to Philadelphia and personally apologizing to the two victims, Johnson enabled them to become spokespeople for the broader issue of racial bias and neutralized protesters gathered outside Starbucks. Zuckerberg wasted his opportunity to address data privacy issues; instead, he is inviting government regulators to do it for him. As a result, Facebook’s employees lack direction for using this crisis to rebuild confidence with 2 billion users.</p>\n<p><strong>#6: You’re in the spotlight: Follow True North.&nbsp;</strong>Starbucks’ Johnson jumped into the spotlight the next day by apologizing for his employees’ handling of the incident and announcing plans for a companywide “lessons learned” meeting and training programs. He affirmed Starbucks’&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/why-leaders-lose-their-way\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">True North</a>, stating, “The video shot by customers is very hard to watch, and the actions in it are not representative of our Starbucks mission and values.” In contrast, Zuckerberg ducked the spotlight for five days and even then tried to shift the argument away from data privacy. In terms of public support, this tactic backfired because he undermined Facebook’s mission “to build community and bring the world closer together.” In a recent&nbsp;<a class=\"ext\" href=\"https://bit.ly/2HVcl4i\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Harris poll</a>, 88 percent of respondents think Facebook should be regulated, with 67 percent favoring requiring an opt-in feature before personal data can be used.</p>\n<p><strong>#7: Go on offense, focus on winning now.&nbsp;</strong>Kevin Johnson seized upon the incident to clarify Starbucks’ desire to overcome racial bias and encourage acceptance and integration. Johnson will benefit from engaging all of his employees in discussions about serving customers well and using the company to make a positive difference in its communities. Meanwhile, Zuckerberg remains on the defensive about Facebook’s policies rather than offering clear solutions. One possibility: a premium site for those who want to protect all their information. In the meantime, users may shift to competing social media sites.</p>\n<h3>The greatest test of leadership</h3>\n<p>When a crisis erupts, the CEO’s actions and attitude in the first 24 to 48 hours sets the tone for the organization’s response. In Johnson’s case, this meant making a clear statement apologizing and accepting responsibility, going to the scene of the incident, and meeting personally with people effected. Facebook’s Zuckerberg did none of these things. After those first days, the moment had passed and other voices were crowding out his company’s messages.</p>\n<p>Leading in crisis is the real test for leaders. Zuckerberg failed his big test and will struggle to recover. Johnson has rebuilt goodwill with Starbucks customers and the general public, and has given clear direction to employees about what the company stands for. That will serve Starbucks well for years to come.</p>\n</div>\n</div><div>\n<p>Johnson &amp; Johnson CEO Jim Burke’s leadership during the 1982&nbsp;<a class=\"ext\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/23/your-money/tylenol-made-a-hero-of-johnson-johnson-the-recall-that-started.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tylenol crisis</a>&nbsp;is what we at Harvard Business School teach as the standard for handling a high-stakes public crisis.

Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, who struggled from repeated missteps in Facebook’s current data privacy crisis, could learn a lot from Johnson.</p><p>Let’s examine how Johnson and Zuckerberg measured up against what I have identified as&nbsp;<a class=\"ext\" href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lessons-Leading-Crisis-Bill-George/dp/0470531878\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis</a>.</p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Lessons-Leading-Crisis-Bill-George/dp/0470531878\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis</a><p><strong>#1: Face reality, starting with yourself.&nbsp;</strong>Johnson realized immediately that, as Starbucks’ new CEO, he had to take the lead. He understood the incident’s implications went well beyond the specifics, triggering widespread concerns about racial bias in the country and threatening to damage Starbucks’ image as a safe, friendly place to gather with friends or work alone. In contrast, Zuckerberg characterized Facebook’s issue as a political problem and tried to shift the blame to Cambridge Analytica’s bad actors for violating Facebook’s rules for application developers. He ignored the deeper problem that Facebook users want privacy for their personal information.</p><strong>#1: Face reality, starting with yourself.&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>#2: Use your teammates.&nbsp;</strong>Johnson had the full support of founder Howard Schultz and his team in Philadelphia. Zuckerberg did not seem to rely upon the wisdom of Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg or lead board director Susan Desmond-Hellmann. Instead, he trotted out his deputy legal counsel at a town hall meeting for all Facebook employees after four days, sending the message that he thought this was a legal problem rather than an issue of consumer trust.</p><strong>#2: Use your teammates.&nbsp;</strong><blockquote><p>“JOHNSON’S ACTIONS WILL BECOME THE NEW MODEL FOR HOW A CRISIS SHOULD BE HANDLED”</p></blockquote><p>“JOHNSON’S ACTIONS WILL BECOME THE NEW MODEL FOR HOW A CRISIS SHOULD BE HANDLED”</p><p><strong>#3: Dig deep for the root cause.&nbsp;</strong>Johnson perceived that not all his employees understood the deeper issues of racial bias, so he announced on the second day that Starbucks would close 8,000 stores on May 29 to train all 175,000 US employees about unconscious bias. Zuckerberg failed to acknowledge that the root cause of the data privacy scandal was its model of allowing developers to build their applications around user preferences—without explicit permission from the users themselves. (Zuckerberg says this is not the same as selling user information.&nbsp;<a class=\"ext\" href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40554491/zuckerberg-keeps-insisting-facebook-doesnt-sell-our-data-what-it-does-is-even-worse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You be the judge</a>.)</p><strong>#3: Dig deep for the root cause.&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/40554491/zuckerberg-keeps-insisting-facebook-doesnt-sell-our-data-what-it-does-is-even-worse\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">You be the judge</a><p><strong>#4: Get ready for the long haul.&nbsp;</strong>Johnson’s planned training sessions demonstrated his commitment to ensure all employees are dedicated to making its stores safe, friendly, and welcoming for everyone. Zuckerberg said that he had known about the Cambridge Analytica problems since 2015 but wouldn’t acknowledge he had failed to correct them. Nor has he announced plans to do so now. This issue will plague Facebook for years before trust can rebuilt with users.</p><strong>#4: Get ready for the long haul.&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>#5: Never waste a good crisis.&nbsp;</strong>By immediately flying to Philadelphia and personally apologizing to the two victims, Johnson enabled them to become spokespeople for the broader issue of racial bias and neutralized protesters gathered outside Starbucks. Zuckerberg wasted his opportunity to address data privacy issues; instead, he is inviting government regulators to do it for him. As a result, Facebook’s employees lack direction for using this crisis to rebuild confidence with 2 billion users.</p><strong>#5: Never waste a good crisis.&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>#6: You’re in the spotlight: Follow True North.&nbsp;</strong>Starbucks’ Johnson jumped into the spotlight the next day by apologizing for his employees’ handling of the incident and announcing plans for a companywide “lessons learned” meeting and training programs.

      "<p>LIZ FEDOR</p><h3>Since 2016, seven of Minnesota’s 15 largest public companies announced CEO departures.</h3><p>n 2017, Richard Davis left his CEO job at U.S. Bancorp, and a few months later Ken Powell gave up the CEO reins at General Mills, as did Stephen Hemsley at UnitedHealth Group. On July 1, Inge Thulin will step down at 3M Co.</p><p>Why are so many prominent local CEOs heading for the exits? Since 2016, seven of Minnesota’s 15 largest public companies announced CEO departures.</p><p>“We’re going through major generational change with CEOs in the Twin Cities,” says Bill George, former Medtronic CEO and a senior fellow at Harvard Business School.</p><p>Still, “there is turnover in people, but not necessarily turnover in business strategy and community engagement,” says Paul Vaaler, a business and law professor at the University of Minnesota. That’s because five of the seven corporations decided to promote executives from within their ranks. That’s the case with U.S. Bancorp, General Mills, UnitedHealth and 3M. At Hormel, James Snee was promoted from the president’s position to succeed Jeffrey Ettinger as CEO.</p><p>An effective CEO must assemble the right team, be able to expand the business and have the “vision to understand where the company needs to go in a new era,” George says. He argues that a new CEO is poised to succeed when the person rises from within the company.</p><p>Vaaler notes that the CEO changes were much different at Supervalu and Patterson Cos.; each recently hired external candidates as leaders, and each has struggled. Mark Gross took the helm at Supervalu in 2016 after leading Surry Investment Advisors; he’s charged with turning the grocery business around. Patterson chose Mark Walchirk, a McKesson veteran, to become CEO in 2017 and address issues within the dental business. The previous Supervalu CEO served three years, and Patterson had an interim CEO.</p><p>For U.S. CEOs who left S&amp;P 500 companies in 2016, the average tenure was nine years, according to a national report by the Conference Board. Davis, Ettinger, Hemsley and Powell each served a decade or more, and were ready to pass the baton.</p><p>George is encouraged that many of the departing Minnesota CEOs have groomed their successors to play leadership roles in the community. The new CEOs should “work closely with the mayor, the City Council, United Way and arts organizations,” he says, as well as business groups that advocate for good schools, health care and quality of life.</p><p><em>This content was originally published by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://tcbmag.com/news/articles/2018/may/why-are-so-many-prominent-executives-leaving-big-c\">Twin Cities Business</a> on 4/20/18.</em></p><em>This content was originally published by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://tcbmag.com/news/articles/2018/may/why-are-so-many-prominent-executives-leaving-big-c\">Twin Cities Business</a> on 4/20/18.</em><a href=\"http://tcbmag.com/news/articles/2018/may/why-are-so-many-prominent-executives-leaving-big-c\">Twin Cities Business</a><div></div>"

      "<p><strong>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s open letter to CEOs has reignited the “shareholders versus stakeholders” debate.&nbsp;<b>Bill George</b>&nbsp;says it’s actually not much of a debate: mission-driven, values-centered companies perform better.</strong></p><strong>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s open letter to CEOs has reignited the “shareholders versus stakeholders” debate.&nbsp;<b>Bill George</b>&nbsp;says it’s actually not much of a debate: mission-driven, values-centered companies perform better.</strong><b>Bill George</b><p>BlackRock CEO Larry Fink’s recent&nbsp;<a class=\"ext\" href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">letter</a>&nbsp;to all CEOs in the S&amp;P 500 has reignited the never-ending debate of “shareholders versus stakeholders.” Titled “A Sense of Purpose,” Fink’s letter is both inspiring and blunt. It does not pull its punches as Fink tells CEOs that their companies must serve a social purpose.</p><a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">letter</a><p>“Society is demanding that companies, both public and private, serve a social purpose,” Fink wrote. “To prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society. Companies must benefit all of their stakeholders, including shareholders, employees, customers, and the communities in which they operate.”</p><p>This position sharply contrasts to Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman’s famous 1970 article,&nbsp;<a class=\"ext\" href=\"https://vivipins.com/social-responsibilities-of-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits</a>. Friedman argued that businessmen who “take seriously their responsibilities for providing employment, eliminating discrimination, avoiding pollution or whatever else. . . are preaching pure and unadulterated socialism.”</p><a href=\"https://vivipins.com/social-responsibilities-of-business/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase its Profits</a><p>Does this make Larry Fink a socialist? Hardly. In fact, Fink is one of the world’s great capitalists. He cofounded BlackRock in 1988 and has grown it into the world’s largest money manager with more than $6 trillion in assets under management. Yet many other fund managers, private equity executives, and activist investors believe Fink’s push toward the stakeholder model will sacrifice their returns. They believe that companies must select among binary options of serving shareholders or serving society.</p><p>This is a wrong-headed idea because companies with clarity about their purpose actually&nbsp;<em>perform better</em>&nbsp;in the long run. When they do so, they transcend this binary choice and achieve both results. What’s missing in this debate is a deeper understanding of&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;value is created, and how it benefits all stakeholders in society—especially shareholders.</p><em>perform better</em><em>how</em><blockquote><p>“DOES THIS MAKE LARRY FINK A SOCIALIST? HARDLY. IN FACT, FINK IS ONE OF THE WORLD’S GREAT CAPITALISTS”</p></blockquote><p>“DOES THIS MAKE LARRY FINK A SOCIALIST? HARDLY. IN FACT, FINK IS ONE OF THE WORLD’S GREAT CAPITALISTS”</p><p>Let’s focus on&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;shareholder value is created. Every company should start with a clear purpose and set of values that go beyond making money. It is the purpose and values that motivate and unify employees worldwide, not merely a company’s financial goals. Most employees know they will never be wealthy, but they want to make a difference through their work. If they can align their personal purpose with the company’s purpose, there is a congruence that inspires them to do superior work, create great products and innovations, achieve the highest quality, and provide customers with superior service.</p><em>how</em><p>It is through innovations and superior service that companies create customer satisfaction and loyalty. That, in turn, leads to increased revenues and ultimately greater profitability—the basis for creating ongoing shareholder value. The key to sustaining this formula is the companies’ willingness to reinvest significant portions of its profits in the business—through research and development, market expansion, capital expenditures, and most importantly (and often forgotten) development of talented people and leaders.</p><p>This virtuous circle creates value for all stakeholders of the enterprise, including its shareholders and owners. I first presented this concept (see chart below) at the Academy of Management in August 2001, shortly after I concluded my ten years as CEO of Medtronic. It is as valid today as it was then.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><blockimg class=\"size-medium wp-image-7307 aligncenter\" src=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sustaining-growth-300x182.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"182\" srcset=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sustaining-growth-300x182.png 300w, https://www.billgeorge.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sustaining-growth.png 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></blockimg></p><blockimg src=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sustaining-growth-300x182.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"182\" srcset=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sustaining-growth-300x182.png 300w, https://www.billgeorge.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sustaining-growth.png 560w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\"></blockimg><p>This is the rigorous approach we followed at Medtronic as the company’s market capitalization rose from $400 million in 1985 to $60 billion by 2000. Today, thanks to the revival of long-term investments under CEO Omar Ishrak, Medtronic’s shareholder value has risen to $110 billion.</p><p>The challenge to the virtuous circle comes when companies are faced with economic declines or business difficulties due to technology and market changes. Will they continue to invest, or do they cut back on the very things that have made them successful in good times? That’s the real test of leadership—whether it has a long-term view or strictly a short-term mentality. This does not argue against cost-cutting; in fact, cutting infrastructure, supply chain costs, and excess expenses should be done all the time, in good times and bad.</p><p>This is the approach used by ExxonMobil as it has been one of the greatest value creators in the last 100 years. Even as the price of oil drops significantly as it has in the last three years, Exxon continues to invest heavily in capital expenditures around the world to discover and produce more oil and natural gas, yet it is continuously cutting its internal costs to be more efficient.</p><p>Once companies fall prey to cutting long-term investments instead of building for the future, they are headed into the well-worn trap that has engulfed General Electric, just as it did formerly great companies like Sears Roebuck, General Motors (pre-bankruptcy), Motorola, Kodak, and many more. Cost-cutting actions may please short-term shareholders, but they never create sustainable increases in shareholder value.</p><p>In his letter Fink describes this phenomenon very accurately, “Without a sense of purpose, no company, either public or private, can achieve its full potential. It will ultimately lose the license to operate from key stakeholders. It will succumb to short-term pressures to distribute earnings, and, in the process, sacrifice investments in employee development, innovation, and capital expenditures that are necessary for long-term growth.”</p><p>The great long-term value creators of the past 25 years all follow this approach. Examples include Apple, Alphabet/Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Berkshire Hathaway, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Exxon and Walmart as well as China’s Tencent and Alibaba—currently, the most valuable public companies in the world.</p><p>There should be no debate between the stakeholder value model and the advocates of creating shareholder value. Shareholder value is the&nbsp;<em>result</em>&nbsp;of having a clear mission and set of values that motivate employees to serve customers. Companies that start with the mantra of “maximizing shareholder value” ultimately destroy the very shareholder value that they are trying to create because they refuse to make the long-term investments required to create sustainable shareholder value.</p><em>result</em><p>Corporate leaders would be well advised to follow Fink’s thoughtful counsel. He isn’t just speaking for BlackRock but for all the long-term investors who depend on their leaders to sustain shareholder value for many years to come.</p><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/op-ed-why-blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-is-not-a-socialist?cid=wk-sm-tw-sf85612737&amp;sf85612737=1\">HBSWK.hbs.edu</a> on 3/12/18.</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/op-ed-why-blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-is-not-a-socialist?cid=wk-sm-tw-sf85612737&amp;sf85612737=1\">HBSWK.hbs.edu</a> on 3/12/18.</em><a href=\"https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/op-ed-why-blackrock-ceo-larry-fink-is-not-a-socialist?cid=wk-sm-tw-sf85612737&amp;sf85612737=1\">HBSWK.hbs.edu</a><div></div>"

      "<p><span class=\"byline-role\">By&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/jena-mcgregor/\">Jena McGregor</a></p><span>By&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/jena-mcgregor/\">Jena McGregor</a><p data-elm-loc=\"1\">When&nbsp;Dick’s Sporting Goods CEO Edward W. Stack took a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/retail/2018/02/28/heres-what-dicks-sporting-goods-ceo-ed-stack-wrote-his-companys-actions/381452002/\">stance</a>&nbsp;after the Parkland, Fla., school massacre, most of the attention was on what his retail chain would stop doing: It would no longer sell&nbsp;assault weapons, no&nbsp;longer sell high-capacity magazines and no&nbsp;longer sell guns to customers under age 21.</p><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/retail/2018/02/28/heres-what-dicks-sporting-goods-ceo-ed-stack-wrote-his-companys-actions/381452002/\">stance</a><p data-elm-loc=\"2\">But&nbsp;Stack’s statement&nbsp;also was notable for what he said he wanted to see done, according to those who study how companies engage on social issues.&nbsp;His&nbsp;memo didn’t just make a&nbsp;vague statement about&nbsp;the need for leaders in Washington to address the problem. Instead, he outlined specific measures that he thought gun legislation should cover, with a bulleted list that outlined&nbsp;several commonly cited measures for gun-control reform.</p><p data-elm-loc=\"3\">“We implore our elected officials to enact common sense gun reform and pass the following regulations,” Stack&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/retail/2018/02/28/heres-what-dicks-sporting-goods-ceo-ed-stack-wrote-his-companys-actions/381452002/\">wrote</a>.&nbsp;The memo&nbsp;called for&nbsp;banning assault-style firearms, raising the minimum age for gun purchases, banning high-capacity magazines and bump stocks, requiring universal background checks that include relevant mental-health&nbsp;data and “previous interactions with the law” requiring a database of prohibited buyers, and closing the private-sale and gun show loophole.</p><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/retail/2018/02/28/heres-what-dicks-sporting-goods-ceo-ed-stack-wrote-his-companys-actions/381452002/\">wrote</a><p data-elm-loc=\"5\">Stack runs a sporting-goods business that sells firearms, so some of those&nbsp;measures, were they to become law,&nbsp;would&nbsp;put his store’s decisions in line with other retailers. But advisers&nbsp;on corporate brand&nbsp;issues&nbsp;said&nbsp;his explicit call for legislation also turned&nbsp;a&nbsp;page in the recent chapter of CEO activism, thanks to&nbsp;the particular nature of the gun-control debate and the evolution of corporate America’s increasingly inextricable role on social issues.</p><p data-elm-loc=\"6\">“You&nbsp;don’t normally hear a company articulate these things — they usually do it through lobbying support,” said Anthony Johndrow,&nbsp;a&nbsp;New York-based adviser to companies on corporate reputation.</p><p data-elm-loc=\"7\">He said even if the suggestions directly mirror policy requests from some gun-control advocacy groups, the list of&nbsp;policy requests feels like the next step for companies to take as more&nbsp;and more wade in on social issues, tying their brands to causes or issues that can be political hot buttons.&nbsp;“The first phase is just to state an opinion, the second phase&nbsp;is&nbsp;to take action&nbsp;at the company, and the third phase is maybe to call on the government to do something,” he said.</p><p data-elm-loc=\"8\">Companies, of course, have long&nbsp;had their say on&nbsp;specific policies through lobbying and have weighed in&nbsp;publicly when they&nbsp;disagree&nbsp;on&nbsp;legislation or other action, such as President Trump’s plan to withdraw from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2017/06/01/ceos-make-final-pleas-to-trump-to-stay-in-paris-climate-agreement/?utm_term=.db6cace11741\">Paris&nbsp;climate agreement</a>&nbsp;or his&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2017/09/05/i-dont-think-they-fear-this-president-ceos-blast-trumps-dreamers-decision/?utm_term=.10caa5649ee7\">position</a>&nbsp;on young undocumented immigrants.&nbsp;More than 200 companies&nbsp;signed letters against North Carolina’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2016/09/26/add-big-investors-to-the-list-of-those-taking-aim-at-north-carolinas-bathroom-bill-2/\">HB2 law</a>, often known as the state’s “bathroom bill” for its policy&nbsp;about restroom use for transgender people in government buildings and public schools. They have at times signed an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/06/amicus-briefs-gay-marriage-supreme-court/24492849/\">amicus brief</a>&nbsp;in support of certain issues, such as same-sex marriage.</p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2017/06/01/ceos-make-final-pleas-to-trump-to-stay-in-paris-climate-agreement/?utm_term=.db6cace11741\">Paris&nbsp;climate agreement</a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2017/09/05/i-dont-think-they-fear-this-president-ceos-blast-trumps-dreamers-decision/?utm_term=.10caa5649ee7\">position</a><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2016/09/26/add-big-investors-to-the-list-of-those-taking-aim-at-north-carolinas-bathroom-bill-2/\">HB2 law</a><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2015/03/06/amicus-briefs-gay-marriage-supreme-court/24492849/\">amicus brief</a><p data-elm-loc=\"9\">Still,&nbsp;those who follow the interaction between social issues and corporate activism said Stack’s memo was notable for its inclusion of distinct solutions. While some of his suggestions are part of current bills or have even been mentioned by Trump,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17053968/gun-control-debate-congress-parkland\">lawmakers are yet</a>to&nbsp;come together around a single bill.</p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17053968/gun-control-debate-congress-parkland\">lawmakers are yet</a><p data-elm-loc=\"10\">“In the past, the advocacy&nbsp;around an issue by the CEO or their leadership team may have been limited to participation in an amicus brief or inclusive HR policies,”&nbsp;said Chris Allieri, principal of communications at brand consultancy Mulberry &amp; Astor. “This is not a time for companies to split hairs and craft carefully worded press statements.”</p><p data-elm-loc=\"12\">Advisers and&nbsp;researchers&nbsp;who study the issue cite a&nbsp;couple of reasons CEOs may be more willing to follow Stack and make&nbsp;more-explicit proposals.&nbsp;One has to do with the issue of gun control itself and the students who’ve kept&nbsp;it in the news.&nbsp;With so much criticism about leaders issuing&nbsp;platitudes rather than making changes of substance, with the public following the issue so closely and with gun violence becoming a disturbingly serial focus of headlines, speaking out on the issue in general terms could&nbsp;come off as inauthentic.</p><p data-elm-loc=\"13\">“It’s&nbsp;not&nbsp;enough to just release a statement — you have to be very specific,&nbsp;otherwise&nbsp;it could be like greenwashing,” said Aaron Chatterji, an associate professor of business and public policy at Duke University, using&nbsp;a term that describes when&nbsp;brands present themselves as environmentally responsible&nbsp;when they’re not.</p><p data-elm-loc=\"14\">Meanwhile, as CEOs&nbsp;increasingly speak out on social issues, people may be expecting&nbsp;more from them than a simple tweet about an issue or a vaguely worded statement. Chatterji recently penned an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/opinion/dicks-guns-walmart.html\">op-ed</a>&nbsp;in the New York Times&nbsp;where he wrote that “there is no going back” and that brands are likely to segment even more into being identified with conservative or liberal demographics. As a result, he thinks&nbsp;an evolution could be happening where people expect more from what’s in&nbsp;those corporate statements, too. “That specificity is going to raise the bar for future&nbsp;CEO activists,” he said. “People are going to ask the follow-up questions.”</p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/02/opinion/dicks-guns-walmart.html\">op-ed</a><p data-elm-loc=\"15\"><strong>Bill George, the former CEO of Medtronic and an instructor at Harvard Business School, said&nbsp;more could follow Stack’s lead.</strong></p><strong>Bill George, the former CEO of Medtronic and an instructor at Harvard Business School, said&nbsp;more could follow Stack’s lead.</strong><p data-elm-loc=\"16\"><strong>“This is very different than sending your lobbyists in to get favorable treatment — this is about their mission and their purpose.

These are part of our companies’ families. We want to make sure they’re safe, otherwise people are not going to come to work for our companies and live in our communities.

      "<p>Integrity and trust must be the objectives of all modern enterprises – and the effective CCO is at the heart of achieving these elusive goals.</p><p>There was lots of talk of integrity, authenticity, transparency, and truth at the Arthur Page Center 2018 Awards in New York City on Wednesday evening.</p><p>And why shouldn’t there be? After all, the organization was set up specifically to promote “integrity in public communication.”</p><p>These tenets were espoused in spades from the stage by two of the 2018 honorees: Bill George, former CEO of Medtronic and now senior fellow at Harvard Business School, and John Onoda, veteran of CCO stints at GM, Levi Strauss, Visa, and Charles Schwab, and now a consultant at Gagen MacDonald.</p><p>Onoda said: “Integrity in PR is more important than ever. Integrity and trust are withering in the public’s view of leaders and institutions. In the absence of trust and integrity, cynicism, opportunism, greed, and the abuse of power flourish.</p><p>“Cynical people manipulate the system to achieve positions of power, only to lead their followers, constituencies, or flocks down the wrong path. Civil discourse becomes impossible.”</p><p>He observed that PR people used to be part of a relatively closed network of large companies, government bodies, agencies, and the news media, which had a near monopoly on words in the public space.</p><p>“Without our involvement, no average citizen – and even many powerful ones – could make a dent on the public’s consciousness,” he added.</p><p>Clearly that time is well and truly gone.</p><p>As Onoda pointed out: “Anyone with a cellphone can potentially reach billions, starting a public discussion or even a movement.”</p><p>Any individual can propagate their story and version of the truth, making it almost impossible to sort fact from fiction. Check out your Twitter or Facebook feeds on any given day and I guarantee they’ll be littered with negative, biased, and sensationalized words and images.</p><p>In this environment, Onoda noted, you’d never know most people are in essence “normal, honest, and good,” and that most companies and institutions “function as they are intended, try to obey the law and do their best.”</p><p>His sad observation was that, today, when something is said in public, “everyone instinctively awaits the accusation or revelation that the statement was misleading or inaccurate.”</p><p>This obviously has significant implications for all public discourse, but particularly for PR pros, because “skepticism and cynicism toward communications have become second nature to most listeners.”</p><p>“This leads them to assume disparities between what leaders say and what they actually do; between the values they express and the values (or lack of values) revealed by their actions,” concluded Onoda.</p><p>In that environment, he singled out one particular Page Principle and urged all business leaders and communicators to “Prove it with Action.”</p><p>He counseled: “The principle is not ‘prove it with words.’ Nor does it say ‘prove it with press releases.’ ‘Tweets.’ ‘Advertisements.’ ‘Op-eds.’ ‘Photo-ops.’ ‘Full-page ads.’ ‘Blogger exclusives.’ And everything else in our bag of tricks.”</p><p>“It is – ‘Prove it with Action.’”</p><p>These words were reinforced and echoed by the remarks of George, one of those rare CEOs who really understood communications and prioritized it as a fundamental strategic business function – and who is now espousing these crucial values to other CEOs in his educational role at Harvard.</p><p>The former Medtronic leader echoed thoughts that have been expressed in the pages of PRWeek many times.</p><p>Leaders must be completely transparent and upfront with all their stakeholders to create an authentic, sustainable, and successful enterprise.</p><p>They can no longer rely on the old-fashioned tactic of slicing and dicing communication for different audiences – one message for customers, another for shareholders, and yet another for staffers.</p><p>George noted that the truth will always out. If you try to be deceitful it will be impossible to dial back the narrative.</p><p>He urged CEOs to be upfront with the media, especially in times of crisis, and engage honestly, openly, and naturally – be yourself, don’t try to be something you’re not, and don’t try to obfuscate.</p><p>Don’t succumb to the temptation to be overly media trained – be yourself. You will come over more authentically and with integrity, and the broadcaster or journalist interviewing you will also appreciate the approach.</p><p>It is part of the Page Principle of “Proving it with Action.”</p><p>Onoda considers the principle powerful in its simplicity and insight.</p><p>“It is especially relevant to our current predicament, because integrity is mostly a matter of acting consistent with your values or fulfilling your promises,” he explained.</p><p>By “our current predicament,” he meant a significant portion of the population believes government and big business no longer operate according to values such as fairness, honesty, and integrity; they feel politicians and other leaders haven’t lived up to their promises; and they think news media is biased.</p><p>As Onoda noted, for the PR pro this means “taking on the uncomfortable role of the conscience of the company, the naysayer, the wet blanket.”</p><p>“We have to take on entrenched beliefs such as the notion that decisions must be made primarily for the short-term financial benefit of investors; or to win the support of politicians; or to fend off activist investors; or to hold onto key talent even if individuals are behaving in abhorrent ways,” he added.</p><p>For the CCO, this means having the courage and principled nature to put themselves on the line and stand up to the CEO or general counsel, the COO or CFO.</p><p>“We’ve got to talk about uncomfortable, preachy things like ethics, fairness, trust, and integrity with people who can influence our compensation and our careers,” noted Onoda.</p><p>Ethical considerations should be of concern to everyone in an organization, not just the communicators, but the reality is that an effective CCO has to be the one driving this, 100% of the time.</p><p>CCOs are the liquid that infuses all parts of a business or enterprise – and they have to be strong and persistent in their pursuit of high standards if their organizations are to survive and prosper in this cutthroat world.</p><p>I just hope these noble words and principles can survive in this febrile environment and that “normal, honest, and good” qualities win out.</p><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.prweek.com/article/1457960/ccos-not-naysayers-wet-blankets-rather-conscience-companies#4jv5HStkzl5ti7cG.99\">PRWeek.com</a> on 2/23/18.</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.prweek.com/article/1457960/ccos-not-naysayers-wet-blankets-rather-conscience-companies#4jv5HStkzl5ti7cG.99\">PRWeek.com</a> on 2/23/18.</em><a href=\"https://www.prweek.com/article/1457960/ccos-not-naysayers-wet-blankets-rather-conscience-companies#4jv5HStkzl5ti7cG.99\">PRWeek.com</a><div></div>"

      "<p>When she overcame her battle with cancer, Penny George, the wife of former Medtronic CEO Bill George, credited much of her recovery not just to the medical care she received, but to integrative health and healing (IHH) practices, such as yoga, acupuncture, aromatherapy and meditation.</p><p>Now, as a 22-year cancer survivor, Penny George and her husband’s Minneapolis-based nonprofit, the George Family Foundation, are looking to bring availability of the same mind-body-spirit practices she used to downtown Minneapolis.</p><p>Featured within the new YMCA in Gaviidae — set to open this month at Sixth Street on the Nicollet Mall — will be the George Wellbeing Center, a 35,000-square-foot space dedicated to evidence-based IHH practices.</p><p>YMCA members as well as nonmembers will have access to the center, located on the gym’s second floor. Among the amenities to available at the center will be lifestyle and nutritional counseling, massage therapy, aromatherapy, light therapy, meditation, tai chi, yoga, acupuncture, and even reiki, a form of alternative medicine developed in Japan involving “palm healing.”</p><p>“Since our first planning meeting in 2017, we’ve designed this groundbreaking center to help people take charge of their health through accessible, affordable tools and techniques,” said Penny George, a now-retired psychologist, in a statement. “This is an exciting new offering that will connect people with the integrative healing practices that can make a difference in their lives—and I know firsthand from my own health journey.”</p><p>The George Family Foundation will be providing $2.5 million to help cover the costs of the new center.</p><p>The donation is the latest in a string of IHH-related contributions from the nonprofit. Since 1994, the George Family Foundation has dedicated more than $17 million to programs promoting IHH.</p><p>The YMCA of the Greater Twin Cities’ CEO Glen Gunderson said in a statement the fitness company was “thrilled” to receive the foundation’s support, adding that it would “advance integrative health and healing practices” use in the community.</p><p>On top of the George Family Foundation’s

      "<p>There is so much turmoil in the world these days that we wonder if we will ever get back to “normal.” Or have we forgotten what normal feels like?</p><p>During 2017, down was up, and the world was filled with fake media, alternative facts (if there is such a thing), threats of nuclear war, climate change denial, withdrawal from global trade agreements, tax cuts for the uber-wealthy, attempts to take health care away from tens of millions, praising of Neo-Nazis, White Supremacists and Ku Klux Klan, exposure of sexual deviants, comparisons of pedophilia to Mary and Joseph, mass killings, denial of Russia’s interference in U.S. elections, and on and on.</p><p>As upsetting as these things are, in actuality we cannot change them. Nor can we change the people who create these cognitive distortions. In his famous “Serenity Prayer,” theologian Reinhold Niebuhr wrote, “God grant me the serenity&nbsp;to accept the things I cannot change.”</p><p>With cable television and social media constantly arousing our fears and animosities, it is hard to accept that as hard as we try, much that goes on within the world and within its people remains out of our control.</p><p>Here is my reality:</p><p><em>The only thing we can change is ourselves, and how we respond to other people and events.</em></p><em>The only thing we can change is ourselves, and how we respond to other people and events.</em><p>Rather than looking to the external world for validation of our self-worth, we should search inside ourselves where we can <em>discover our True North. </em>Or rediscover it if we have moved away from it.</p><em>discover our True North. </em><p>Our True North is the essence of who we are as human beings: our deepest beliefs, our most cherished values and the principles by which we lead our lives. True North is the internal compass that guides us successfully through life. When the world around seems like it is spinning out of control, True North is our orienting point that helps us stay on track as human beings. When we are in sync with our True North, we feel a deep sense of fulfillment and personal satisfaction.</p><p>The external world with all its trials and tribulations can pull us off course of our True North. Instead of finding satisfaction from within, we look externally for validation that we are worthy. This is a natural human tendency. We all like to hear good things about ourselves and our work in the world. They tend to reinforce our own view of ourselves, and provide inspiration to keep going forward.</p><p>The world around us can be a cruel place. Many people are envious of us, or competitive in unhelpful ways. People make unkind remarks, often out of their own sense of depravation. It is easy to be hurt by them, or get wounded by their opinion of us. As a wise friend told me when I was still in college, “Consider the source.” In other words, do not react to comments from people whose inputs are not valid or kind.</p><p>Yet many people around us genuinely want to help us become better. If taken seriously, their inputs can be invaluable. These “truth tellers” are wise mentors that keep us on course of our True North. It is very important to separate those who have our best interest at heart from those who do not.</p><p>Are your struggling to discover your True North? As we begin 2018, here are 7 steps to assist you in doing so:</p><ol>\n<li>Write down your True North in 50 words or less. Then review it with a close friend or loved one. Does it ring to you as the person you are at your deepest level? If not, revise it to bring it closer to “the real you.”</li>\n<li>How well are you following your True North? Write down the factors that are pulling you off course.</li>\n<li>If you feel you are off track, write down some specific steps that will help you get back on course. Then turn these into a plan for the next several days and weeks.</li>\n<li>Ask yourself, “Am I focusing today on the things that are most important in my life, or am I trapped by the immediacy of the world around me? Is this my agenda or something someone else is imposing on me?” Then focus yourself on the most important things.</li>\n<li>Develop a daily introspective practice such as mindfulness, meditation, prayer, sitting quietly in a tranquil place, taking a long walk, or having a deep discussion with someone very close to you. This practice only takes 20 minutes but needs to be done every day so that you don’t get caught up with external forces.</li>\n<li>Ask someone you trust for honest feedback about whether your actions convey your True North, and how they might be improved.</li>\n<li>Start and end every day by affirming your inherent goodness and ways you are making this world a better place.</li>\n</ol><li>Write down your True North in 50 words or less.

It is well known that unhealthy life styles account for 50 to 70 percent of health-care costs. For example, America’s obesity epidemic is the leading cause of Type II diabetes, heart disease, and spine, hip and knee issues. Yet instead of focusing on enabling people to lead healthy lives, we concentrate downstream on those who are sick and extremely ill to the point of nonrecovery.</p>\n<p>To enable Americans to lead healthy lives, we should focus on three basic areas: 1) eating healthy, 2) physical fitness, and 3) stress reduction. How can innovation change life styles? Let’s look at some examples:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Eating healthy</strong>. Innovative food and beverage companies, such as Boulder Brands and Suja Juice are transforming eating and drinking habits along with products like Earth Balance all-natural spreads, Udi’s gluten-free cereals and baked goods, and organic juices.</li>\n<li><strong>Physical fitness</strong>. A relatively simple device like Fitbit has become transformative in changing people’s behavior by walking at least 10,000 steps per day or exercising in Lifetime Fitness clubs that focus on healthy living.</li>\n<li><strong>Stress reduction</strong>. The mindfulness movement is revolutionizing daily behaviors that reduce stress through myriad mindfulness practices. Don’t know how to meditate? Innovative on-line products like Headspace provide guided meditation sessions and mindfulness training.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Today, the usage of these products is heavily concentrated among the middle and upper social-economic classes. The key now is to get them as ubiquitous as mobile phones by offering them in local communities and at lower prices.</p>\n<p>For decades, American health-care systems have been mired in trying to become more efficient with essentially the same methods. What is needed to transform health care’s broken system is much more radical transformation that these innovations can bring. Rather than looking for political solutions to a broken system, the focus must shift to innovation to create more radical approaches that create entirely new systems.</p>\n<p><em>Commentary by Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School, former chairman and CEO of Medtronic, and the author of “Discover Your True North.” He is a CNBC contributor.

The practice often involves calming the mind by focusing on each breath.</p><p>Countless corporate leaders run, climb mountains or skydive in pursuit of optimal physical and mental fitness. Now, a growing number—including the chiefs of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/CRM\">Salesforce.com</a>&nbsp;Inc.,Whole Foods Market,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/AET\">Aetna</a>&nbsp;Inc.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/AET?mod=chiclets\">AET&nbsp;0.34%&nbsp;</a>and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/WSM\">Williams-Sonoma</a>&nbsp;Inc.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/WSM?mod=chiclets\">WSM&nbsp;-0.58%&nbsp;</a>—meditate to lower their stress and boost productivity.

With many more CEOs meditating than 10 years ago, the practice can be seen as self-indulgent, says David Brendel, a psychiatrist and executive coach. “Most employees don’t have time to do it.’’</p><p>Several top bosses encourage workers to take time for meditation on the job. Salesforce, a software company run by veteran meditator Marc Benioff, offers “mindfulness zones” in 14 of its office buildings world-wide. Staffers can “pause to invite calmness and balance’’ in the gadget-free spaces, says a Salesforce spokeswoman.</p><p><strong>Meditation makes CEOs more effective, “and CEOs set the standard for everyone else in the company,’’ says Bill George, who led medical-device maker&nbsp;<a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/MDT\">Medtronic</a>&nbsp;PLC between 1991 and 2001.</strong></p><strong>Meditation makes CEOs more effective, “and CEOs set the standard for everyone else in the company,’’ says Bill George, who led medical-device maker&nbsp;<a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/MDT\">Medtronic</a>&nbsp;PLC between 1991 and 2001.</strong><a href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/MDT\">Medtronic</a><p><strong>Mr. George has meditated since 1975. “Oftentimes, my most creative ideas come out of meditation,’’ he says.</strong></p><strong>Mr. George has meditated since 1975. “Oftentimes, my most creative ideas come out of meditation,’’ he says.</strong><p><strong>Yet Mr. George concealed his office meditation practice from colleagues for two decades. “It wasn’t seen as the normal thing to do,’’ he says.</strong></p><strong>Yet Mr. George concealed his office meditation practice from colleagues for two decades. “It wasn’t seen as the normal thing to do,’’ he says.</strong><p>At Ultimate Fitness Group LLC, a global chain of fitness studios, CEO David Long says his executive assistant unexpectedly walked into his corner office when he commenced a morning meditation there two years ago. “Leave me alone in the very beginning of the day,’’ he recalls chiding her.</p><p>Mr. Long now often joins associates in the company’s meditation room, which opened this summer at its Boca Raton, Fla., headquarters.</p><p>But he still finds it challenging to meditate during work. “Once I’m at the office, I’m bombarded with internal pressures,’’ Mr. Long says.</p><p>Tupperware’s Mr. Goings says he hardly ever skips his afternoon meditation because “I have to be in good shape so I don’t make bad decisions.’’</p><p>An unexpected mishap 15 years ago tested his commitment to on-the-job meditation. A private plane flying the CEO to a Tupperware event in Mexico suddenly filled with smoke. The aircraft lost altitude.</p><p>“Mayday!” the pilot cried repeatedly. The smoke finally cleared. Mr. Goings says the plane’s problems shook him up so much that “I didn’t meditate that afternoon.’’</p><p>Certain CEOs encounter resistance when they promote meditation in the workplace, however. That happened to Jim Barnett, leader and co-founder of Glint Inc. in Redwood City, Calif. The four-year-old technology company helps businesses react to its quick, confidential polls of employees, dubbed pulse surveys.</p><p>Mr. Barnett, who has meditated for nearly 28 years, often offers his deputies 10 minutes of guided meditation during their quarterly management-team meetings outside the office.</p><blockquote><p>‘<em>When you meditate together, there’s a sense of connection you have. We execute better as a team when we feel connected.</em>’</p>\n<p>—Jim Barnett, leader and co-founder of tech company Glint</p></blockquote><p>‘<em>When you meditate together, there’s a sense of connection you have. We execute better as a team when we feel connected.</em>’</p><em>When you meditate together, there’s a sense of connection you have.

Is it a test?” Mr. Bell remembers thinking at that time. “What happens if I peek?”</p><p>The marketing chief did participate. But “I was uncomfortable with it,’’ he says. “It feels weird to be in a room [meditating] with your colleagues.’’ Nevertheless, Mr. Bell recently started meditating on his own.</p><p>Mr. Barnett sought feedback from his lieutenants last month after guiding their meditation during the latest management-team meeting at a local country club.</p><p>“Six people really liked it,’’ he says. Though the remaining two reacted neutrally, they say “we should keep doing it,’’ he adds.</p><p>Dr. Brendel has seen ardent meditators cause other difficulties. A few years ago, he counseled a leader whose biotech business badly needed to upgrade its software systems. Staffers were frustrated by his inaction.</p><p>The CEO preferred that employees enroll in the corporate meditation program rather than invest “in changing the technology that was running the company,’’ Dr. Brendel says.</p><p>Meditation “is not for everybody,’’ the executive coach told his client. Improved software “would have the greatest benefit,’’ he continued.</p><p>The chief executive soon changed his mind about the upgrade and reduced spending on meditation training. Today, Dr. Brendel says, “the company is doing OK.’’</p><p><em>Appeared in the November 30, 2017, print edition as ‘Calm in the Corner Office.’</em></p><em>Appeared in the November 30, 2017, print edition as ‘Calm in the Corner Office.’</em><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/meditation-brings-calm-to-ceos-1511960400\">WSJ.com</a> on 11/30/17.</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/meditation-brings-calm-to-ceos-1511960400\">WSJ.com</a> on 11/30/17.</em><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/meditation-brings-calm-to-ceos-1511960400\">WSJ.com</a><div></div>"

It set the standards in leadership, organization, and effective management processes. The company delivered remarkable results over its storied history, evidenced by its stature as the only original component of the Dow Jones industrial average still on the list.</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/?symbol=GE\" data-gdsid=\"18425\" data-inline-quote-symbol=\"GE\">General Electric</a><p>Today GE is becoming a shadow of its former self.</p><p>On November 13, new CEO John Flannery announced the shrinking of GE’s holdings to three businesses – aviation, health care and energy and power – while shedding such legacy businesses as lighting and locomotives. Flannery also declared a 50 percent dividend cut, only the third in GE’s history – this one coming when the economy is strong. Even by spinning off $20 billion in assets, GE apparently can’t move fast enough to preserve the dividends that millions of retired Americans depend upon to maintain their standard of living.</p><p>In describing these dramatic cutbacks, Flannery failed to shed any light on the end of GE’s tunnel. Disappointed investors drove GE stock down an additional 13 percent in the two succeeding days, bringing the cumulative decline to 40 percent since Flannery was announced on June 12, 2017 as successor to former CEO Jeff Immelt. Credit activist investor Nelson Peltz and his partner Ed Garden (now a GE board member) for blowing the whistle earlier this year, accelerating the CEO transition from Immelt to Flannery.</p><p><strong><em>The legacy of Jack Welch</em></strong></p><strong><em>The legacy of Jack Welch</em></strong><em>The legacy of Jack Welch</em><p>The contrast of GE circa 2017 with “The House that Jack (Welch) Built” could not be greater. Since its peak in 2000, GE’s $410 billion market capitalization has shrunk to $156 billion, down $254 billion (62 percent). During his twenty years at the helm, Welch increased GE’s market value twenty-eight times, making GE America’s most valuable corporation. He expanded GE through internal growth and acquisitions, especially in GE Capital, as GE hit every quarter while investing for the long-term. For these results&nbsp;<em>Fortune</em>&nbsp;Magazine named him “Manager of the Century.”</p><em>Fortune</em><p>Welch followed a long line of fabled CEOs that includes Charles Coffin (1892-1922), Ralph Cordiner (1950-1963), and Reginald Jones (1972-1981). He moved aggressively as soon as he took over in 1981 to remake GE with his own imprint – even though it meant undoing predecessor Jones’s legacy. Recognizing GE needed to be much leaner and faster-moving to compete globally in the 21<sup>st</sup>&nbsp;Century, Welch slashed its bloated corporate staff, cut several layers of management, and radically changed GE’s cumbersome processes to accelerate decision making – enabling GE to move in front of major global competitors like Siemens, Phillips and Mitsubishi.</p><sup>st</sup><p>Under his leadership, GE was recognized for its disciplined execution, Six Sigma quality and cost control, and leadership excellence at all levels, built around its in-house training center at Crotonville. GE was known as a leadership factory that developed great leaders for its own ranks and beyond – training the CEOs of Honeywell, Boeing, ABB, Medtronic, and numerous other companies. Myriad business school cases were written to document the underlying reasons for GE’s success. Welch immortalized his accomplishments in his books,&nbsp;<em>Jack: Straight from the Gut</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Winning</em>.</p><em>Jack: Straight from the Gut</em><em>Winning</em><p>Welch is not without his critics, especially after the recent declines. Numerous observers correctly criticize the dependence he created on GE Capital, which accounted for nearly half of GE’s business by the end of his reign. But Welch left GE with a strong balance sheet and abundant cash flow to adapt to any difficulties encountered.</p><p><strong><em>The Immelt years</em></strong></p><strong><em>The Immelt years</em></strong><em>The Immelt years</em><p>The task to correct GE’s overreliance on GE Capital fell to Immelt. He understood the issues, but failed to act in his first seven years – violating Welch’s maxim that new CEOs are judged by their decisions in their first ninety days. When financial markets crashed in 2008, GE’s balance sheet and cash flow were so drained that Immelt had to phone President George W. Bush and ask for a line of credit to keep the company afloat.</p><p>Yet Immelt still hesitated, not completing the final sale of GE Capital to Wells Fargo until 2016, fifteen years after Welch retired. What other CEO gets fifteen years to make desperately needed changes? How did GE invest the proceeds? By buying back $50 billion in stock at high prices, thus diminishing its balance sheet just as its competitors were bulging with cash.</p><p>Where was the GE board during these long years of value destruction? Was it asleep, or did management fail to shed light on its difficulties? Now Flannery is remaking the GE board, cutting it from 18 to 12 members, and adding three new board members with industry expertise. The sighs of “finally,” are drowned out by the cries of, “what took so long?”</p><p><strong><em>What business is GE in?</em></strong></p><strong><em>What business is GE in?</em></strong><em>What business is GE in?</em><p>GE’s deep problem today is that it doesn’t know what business it is in. There is no central purpose that unites its disparate businesses, or enables them to be greater than the sum of its parts. Even GE’s three remaining businesses – aviation, health care, and energy and power – bear little relationship to each other. As CNBC’s Steve Liesmann noted after Flannery’s announcements, why not go all the way and split GE into three separate companies, thereby eliminating the corporate staff and associated corporate costs?</p><p>Barring a strategy for revitalization and dominance of its global markets, GE is destined to become an industrial holding company that buys and sells businesses during market cycles and whose only mission is making money. Surely that will not inspire its customers, employees or shareholders. Meanwhile, GE may fall further behind competitors with clarity of mission and strategy like Boeing, Honeywell, United Technologies, and Johnson &amp; Johnson.</p><p>If anyone ever needed convincing that leadership matters, GE’s example provides the proof. Welch was an exceptional leader whose track record is not diminished by the company’s steady decline after he retired. Immelt was a talented manager who erred by overly-emulating his predecessor’s style when he more appropriately needed to emulate his urgency. In Immelt’s early years he lacked the courage to make bold moves, and the discipline to achieve consistent execution.</p><p>In fairness to Flannery, the jury is still out as he gets started. Thus far, he has given every indication that he is a pure financial manager who lacks vision, strategy, and passion to rebuild GE as a mission-driven, values-centered company. While Flannery may achieve modest improvement in GE’s numbers, he has not demonstrated he can restore its soul.</p><p><em>Commentary by Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and the author of “Discover Your True North.” Follow him on Twitter&nbsp;<a class=\"inline_asset\" title=\"www.twitter.com/Bill_George\" href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Bill_George\" target=\"_self\">@Bill_George</a>.</em></p><em>Commentary by Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and the author of “Discover Your True North.” Follow him on Twitter&nbsp;<a class=\"inline_asset\" title=\"www.twitter.com/Bill_George\" href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Bill_George\" target=\"_self\">@Bill_George</a>.</em><a title=\"www.twitter.com/Bill_George\" href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Bill_George\" target=\"_self\">@Bill_George</a><p><i>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/17/ges-john-flannery-lacks-vision-strategy-and-passion-to-rebuild-company-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a> on 11/17/17.&nbsp;</i></p><i>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/17/ges-john-flannery-lacks-vision-strategy-and-passion-to-rebuild-company-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a> on 11/17/17.&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/11/17/ges-john-flannery-lacks-vision-strategy-and-passion-to-rebuild-company-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a><div></div>"

      "<p>Davy Crockett had it. George Washington had it. Most certainly, Dwight Eisenhower had it. The cowardly lion in The Wizard of Oz really wanted it. What is it?</p><p>Courage. According to Bill George, a Senior Fellow of the Harvard Business School and author of Discover Your True North , it is the one characteristic that separates winners from losers and leaders from key managers in a business organization. George has been doing leadership research for the last 10&nbsp;years, focusing on over 200&nbsp;Presidents and CEOs of large companies. In summary, George makes the case that “the defining characteristic of the best ones is courage to make bold moves that transform their businesses.”</p><p>Sometimes these leaders make hard decisions that result in significant changes throughout the organization. The courage to not only make the decision, even when the stakes are high, but to follow through with the courage that George says “inspires their teams, energizes customers, and positions their companies as leaders in societal change” create the significant potential for a complete upheaval in the marketplace.</p><p>John Wayne said it perfectly when he stated “courage is being scared to death, but saddling up anyway.” While the definition of the word courage is “the quality of mind or spirit that enables a person to face difficulty, danger or pain, without fear,” George goes on to say “courageous leaders lead with principles – their True North – that guide them when the pressure mounts. They don’t shirk bold actions because they fear failure. They don’t need external adulation, nor do they shrink from facing criticism.”</p><p>While many historical examples exist of courageous leaders, both in business and other facets of life, there are some very recent, yet very relevant stories that relate to business growth. In consumer pharmaceuticals, for example, the CEO of Unilever in 2009 was Paul Polman. As George reports, Polman did many good things. He established significant growth goals and began to motivate all the Unilever employees to support sustainability. His goals were not nebulous, but very well articulated. The good news was, as a result of his efforts, Unilever returned two hundred and fourteen percent in the first eight years. The bad news was, with a return like that, Unilever became a target for a hostile takeover by Kraft Heinz in 2017. Being the courageous leader that he was, Polman was able to thwart the hostile takeover and still continue to improve shareholder return.</p><p>The on-going battle between Pepsi and Coke is yet another example of courage in the business world. The CEO of Pepsi, Indra Nooyi, had the courage and tenacity to create their Performance with Purpose strategy in 2006. Overall the strategy recognized the millennial generation is shifting away from soft drinks like Pepsi and trending toward drinks that are healthier. It served as a true complement to their current approach. Seven years later, she was approached by activist investor Nelson Peltz. He wanted to break up the company. She successfully thwarted his attempts and maintained the courage to continue to produce short and intermediate results while still focusing on their long term Performance with Purpose innovative strategy.</p><p>Meanwhile, the CEO of Coca-Cola, Muhtar Kent focused on, in effect, doubling down on the soft drink market, ignoring the trends away from sugary drinks. According to George, the overall performance of Coke has lagged that of Pepsi. From 2011, Coke stock has gone up fifteen percent. Pepsi share prices have increased seventy percent.</p><p>While these are just some examples of courage or lack of courage in the line of fire, many leaders of organizations are too focused on making their immediate or intermediate numbers. They can get too caught up in the present and near term performance of their company, instead of also looking to that long term risk prone decision that might cause them to fail. While ignoring the future by concentrating on the present might be a safer strategy, it is highly likely there will not be substantial growth in your company over time. The key success formula becomes that of having the courage to develop that long range risk strategy while still concentrating and working on the near term issues being faced.</p><p>If you are looking to grow your business regardless of whether you are facing obstacles or not, courage in your leadership should carry the day. William Faulkner said it very well, “you cannot swim for new horizons until you have courage to lose sight of the shore.”</p><p><em>Dan Arens is an Indiana-based business growth advisor.</em></p><em>Dan Arens is an Indiana-based business growth advisor.</em><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/story/36731269/the-characteristic-which-defines-leadership\">InsideIndianaBusiness.com</a> on 11/3/17.</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/story/36731269/the-characteristic-which-defines-leadership\">InsideIndianaBusiness.com</a> on 11/3/17.</em><a href=\"http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/story/36731269/the-characteristic-which-defines-leadership\">InsideIndianaBusiness.com</a><div></div>"

      "<p><strong>By Lisa Hefter</strong><br>\n<em>For The Bellingham Business Journal</em></p><strong>By Lisa Hefter</strong><br><em>For The Bellingham Business Journal</em><p>I’ve been hearing and reading more and more about the concept of “authentic leadership” lately.</p><p>I view this as a good sign, because it suggests that leaders are being held to more constructive and effective standards of leadership, and that the criteria for how leaders are evaluated is evolving.</p><p>I’m fortunate to say that I’ve been surrounded by authentic leaders for much of my life, starting with my dad and continuing through my 24-year career at Peoples Bank — where the leadership team has allowed me to thrive as I worked my way up from a bank teller to my current role as executive vice president and chief financial officer</p><p>Now that I’m in a leadership position, it’s more important to me than ever to be a positive model for others.</p><p>So what does authentic leadership mean to me?</p><p>My role models have consistently embodied the five following traits, and have cultivated these qualities in me.</p><p>• Empathy: Sure, in any business you are there primarily to get a job done. But authentic leaders have empathy.&nbsp;They understand that personal issues may come up and employees need to put themselves or their families first.&nbsp;Throughout my career, I’ve seen it over and over again, that whenever an employee has a personal crisis, the immediate reaction is always “go, take care of yourself, we got this.”&nbsp;It’s a culture I’m proud of, because it creates dedicated employees and builds long-term loyalty.&nbsp;Empathy also extends to supporting employees’ passions and causes in the community at large — whether that’s providing paid time off for volunteer work, participating in local events, or contributing sponsorships and grants to the organizations your employees care passionately about.</p><p>• Self-awareness: This trait is essential for leaders, but is probably the hardest to attain, because you truly have to learn it from experience.&nbsp;Early in my career, I would often seek my dad’s advice for workplace issues.&nbsp;He taught me how to see both sides of every story, and how to focus on controlling what I could, and letting the rest go.&nbsp;He’d remind me to ask myself: What part did I play and how can I make it better?&nbsp;Learning this became incredibly beneficial for me as I took on more responsibility, because it’s vital to understand how you come across to others and to see all sides of a situation.</p><p>• <strong>Consistency: I think it is very important to provide dependable expectations and a consistent work environment that your team can count on.&nbsp;Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School, described this as the ability “to stay consistent with [your] inner compass,” or what he calls one’s “true north.”&nbsp;Not knowing what is expected of you, or what mood your boss is going to be in on any given day, can really take its toll on morale.&nbsp;I always try to tap into my “inner compass” to lead consistently, and with high ethical and moral standards.</strong></p><strong>Consistency: I think it is very important to provide dependable expectations and a consistent work environment that your team can count on.&nbsp;Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School, described this as the ability “to stay consistent with [your] inner compass,” or what he calls one’s “true north.”&nbsp;Not knowing what is expected of you, or what mood your boss is going to be in on any given day, can really take its toll on morale.&nbsp;I always try to tap into my “inner compass” to lead consistently, and with high ethical and moral standards.</strong><p>• Resiliency: An authentic leader acknowledges, learns from and moves on from their mistakes.&nbsp;I’ve learned a lot from my boss, whose policy is that if you make a mistake and understand how you’re going to fix it, then you need to address it and move on.&nbsp;Sometimes my employees will use me as a sounding board to think through how to solve an issue. I’ve learned that often, if I simply listen, my employees and peers will arrive at their own answers and path forward.&nbsp;They walk away feeling better because I didn’t tell them what to do. This also helps build empowered and accountable leaders.</p><p>• Transparency: An authentic leader, in my opinion, not only provides clear direction, but also communicates his or her vision openly and effectively, so everyone feels like they are working toward a common goal.&nbsp;I love this quote: “Transparency, honesty, kindness, good stewardship, even humor, work in businesses at all times.” It’s attributed to John Gerzema, author of The Athena Doctrine, which looks at the correlation between so-called feminine leadership traits and business/organizational success.&nbsp;It sums up my leadership approach, and is how I try to show up to work every day.</p><p>Leading effectively isn’t just about hitting your numbers or running the show.&nbsp;Gone too are the days when leading with an iron fist is rewarded.&nbsp;Authentic leadership is much more about the soft skills.&nbsp;It’s about putting yourself in your employees’ shoes, understanding their personal and professional goals, providing an environment where they can do their best work, and supporting their contributions to the greater community.</p><p>I’m thrilled to see the concept gain greater awareness and serve as a model and hallmark for the next generation of leaders.</p><p><em>Lisa Hefter, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Peoples Bank, was named the Puget Sound Business Journal 2017 Chief Financial Officer of the Year for small private companies.</em></p><em>Lisa Hefter, executive vice president and chief financial officer at Peoples Bank, was named the Puget Sound Business Journal 2017 Chief Financial Officer of the Year for small private companies.</em><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://bbjtoday.com/blog/tips-on-leading-effectively-authentically/35427/\">BBJToday.com</a> on 11/1/17.</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://bbjtoday.com/blog/tips-on-leading-effectively-authentically/35427/\">BBJToday.com</a> on 11/1/17.</em><a href=\"http://bbjtoday.com/blog/tips-on-leading-effectively-authentically/35427/\">BBJToday.com</a><div></div>"

Now, the same can be done to address obesity, inactivity, and excessive stress, which are the major causes of cancer, cardiovascular disease, Type 2 diabetes, joint and spinal surgery, and many other chronic diseases.</p><p>Efforts for healthy living are accelerating across the country, but are disproportionately concentrated among those who can afford them. People in lower social-economic categories are more likely to live in “food deserts,” areas that lack access to healthy foods. They have more limited opportunities for exercise. In addition, they are often beleaguered by toxic stress and trauma – serious problems that are better handled outside institutional health care.</p><p>There are no easy or immediate solutions to such intractable problems. Achieving success will require sustained commitment across the country from government programs working in public-private partnerships with health care institutions, corporations, and non-profit organizations.</p><p>A comprehensive plan should include these elements:</p><ol>\n<li>Develop a nationwide public awareness program to encourage healthy eating, exercise and stress reduction programs through electronic and print media and social media.</li>\n<li>Broaden reimbursement for complementary procedures such as acupuncture, therapeutic massage, physical therapy, and weight reduction programs that have been verified by research.</li>\n<li>Establish local community health centers concentrated in economically-disadvantaged areas, supported by local, state and federal resources, with an emphasis on group classes for healthy eating and nutrition, exercise, and healing from trauma and toxic stress.</li>\n<li>Introduce mindfulness programs for stress reduction in schools and communities.</li>\n<li>Address the growing opioid crisis with drug addiction programs offered locally.</li>\n</ol><li>Develop a nationwide public awareness program to encourage healthy eating, exercise and stress reduction programs through electronic and print media and social media.</li><li>Broaden reimbursement for complementary procedures such as acupuncture, therapeutic massage, physical therapy, and weight reduction programs that have been verified by research.</li><li>Establish local community health centers concentrated in economically-disadvantaged areas, supported by local, state and federal resources, with an emphasis on group classes for healthy eating and nutrition, exercise, and healing from trauma and toxic stress.</li><li>Introduce mindfulness programs for stress reduction in schools and communities.</li><li>Address the growing opioid crisis with drug addiction programs offered locally.</li><p>The resolution of our nation’s health care problems won’t happen overnight. Steady progress can only be achieved by a sustained national effort, just as it was with smoking. If instrumented correctly, this type of comprehensive program will prevent expensive medical treatments, and population health cost will fall. Such proof points will provide a model for more expansive government programs.</p><p>Unless we have the will to address these root causes of America’s health care problems, costs will continue to rise rapidly as health declines further, regardless of what politicians in Washington decide.</p><p><em>Commentary by Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and the author of “Discover Your True North.” Follow him on Twitter&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Bill_George\">@Bill_George</a>.</em></p><em>Commentary by Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and the author of “Discover Your True North.” Follow him on Twitter&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Bill_George\">@Bill_George</a>.</em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Bill_George\">@Bill_George</a><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/23/obamacare-reform-must-address-unhealthy-lifestyles-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a> on 10/23/17.</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/23/obamacare-reform-must-address-unhealthy-lifestyles-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a> on 10/23/17.</em><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/23/obamacare-reform-must-address-unhealthy-lifestyles-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a><div></div>"

site’s founder Reid Hoffman, Thrive Global’s Arianna Huffington, CEO of Medtronic and Harvard professor Bill George and Hootsuite CEO and entrepreneur Ryan Holmes shared the essential skills candidates should have in the modern workplace.</p><a href=\"https://learning.linkedin.com/blog/future-skills/want-to-be-a-great-business-leader-in-5-years--master-these-4-sk\" target=\"_blank\"

succeed – purpose, the ability to empower employees, a bias towards learning and use of social media.</p><p>So whether you’re applying for a promotion at work or submitting your CV for a new role, you need to make sure your resume proves you tick all four boxes.</p><h4><span class=\"mol-style-bold\"><span class=\"femail-ccox\">PURPOSE&nbsp;</span></span></h4><span><span class=\"femail-ccox\">PURPOSE&nbsp;</span></span><span>PURPOSE&nbsp;</span><p>According to Arianna Huffington, one of the most important skills of a future leader is finding and maintaining a sense of what the purpose of the company stands for beyond profits and growth.</p><p>Companies that strive to make a difference or have a vision greater than simply making money tend to outperform those who don’t and tend to attract more talent.</p><p>And it seems to be down to desire of millennials and Generation Xers looking for companies that sit with their own values.</p><p><strong>Bill George added: ‘They only want to work for leaders who are authentic: open, sharing, true-to-their-values, compassionate, committed to a clear sense of purpose and, most importantly, possessed with courage to make bold decisions.’</strong></p><strong>Bill George added: ‘They only want to work for leaders who are authentic: open, sharing, true-to-their-values, compassionate, committed to a clear sense of purpose and, most importantly, possessed with courage to make bold decisions.’</strong><p>So rather than boasting about how much money you can make for a company, thinkin about how you can contribute to its overarching purpose and make sure to mention it on your CV.</p><h4><span class=\"mol-style-bold\"><span class=\"femail-ccox\">EMPOWERING EMPLOYEES</span></span></h4><span><span class=\"femail-ccox\">EMPOWERING EMPLOYEES</span></span><span>EMPOWERING EMPLOYEES</span><p>In today’s workplace, hitting targets and getting certain results is not necessarily the holy grail.</p><p>Business are looking for candidates with critical thinking skills who are constantly learning, while employees are looking for&nbsp;ownership over their roles, purpose in their work and learning opportunities to advance their career.</p><p>So when you’re applying for a management role, rather than stating that you will lead a team to hitting their targets, suggest that you’ll empower employees by giving them learning opportunities and a sense of purpose.</p><h4><span class=\"mol-style-bold\"><span id=\"ext-gen120\" class=\"femail-ccox\">SHOW A BIAS FOR

constantly changing, thanks to evolving technology.</p><p>And Reid Hoffman says that leaders need to prioritise constant learning, giving Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky as two examples of people who excel.</p><p>‘As a CEO, you need to become an infinite learner to make yourself more adaptable,’ he said.</p><p>‘The world of business is changing, and you can’t rely solely on your previous expertise, no matter effective it has been until now.’</p><p>Of course, it’s important to include the academic achievements in the past and cite what you’ve learned in your career so far, but you’ll impress an employer if you express a desire to keep updating your knowledge.</p><h4><span class=\"mol-style-bold\"><span id=\"ext-gen123\" class=\"femail-ccox\">PROVE YOU USE SOCIAL MEDIA&nbsp;</span></span></h4><span><span id=\"ext-gen123\" class=\"femail-ccox\">PROVE YOU USE SOCIAL MEDIA&nbsp;</span></span><span>PROVE YOU USE SOCIAL MEDIA&nbsp;</span><p>While a profile littered with swear words and drunken selfies is not going to land you the dream job, considered used of Twitter and Instagram can be seen as a major plus point.</p><p>Ryan Holmes pointed out that your employees,&nbsp;customers, competitors, investors, partners and stakeholders are all likely to spend time on social media, so you could be missing out on crucial information if you’re not active too.</p><p>It can also help you establish that key sense of purpose, by using it to highlight your brand values and how the organisation delivers.</p><p>And in turn, this will help your organisation to attract the best talen.</p><p>‘For CEOs, social media is, in no uncertain terms, a core competency,’ Holmes said. ‘Those who are able to master it tap into the most dominant communication platform today. Those who ignore it risk having the competition eat their lunch.’</p><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4926590/CEOs-reveal-four-qualities-highlight-CV.html\">DailyMail.com</a> on 9/29/17.&nbsp;</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4926590/CEOs-reveal-four-qualities-highlight-CV.html\">DailyMail.com</a> on 9/29/17.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-4926590/CEOs-reveal-four-qualities-highlight-CV.html\">DailyMail.com</a><div></div>"

      "<p>Was Google CEO&nbsp;Sundar Pichai&nbsp;right to fire engineer James Damore after his condemnation of the company’s diversitry initiatives? Of course, answers Bill George; treating colleagues as gender stereotypes rather than as individuals poisons the workplace.</p><p>Google software engineer James Damore’s ten-page manifesto excoriating his employer for its diversity initiatives incited a major controversy in August about affirmative action and free speech. Damore’s text went viral to 40,000 people at Google and millions more around the world before Google CEO Sundar Pichai terminated him. The ensuing debate expanded far beyond the Google campus, during which many people sided with Damore as being treated unfairly for expressing his opinions.</p><p>The central issue here is not political correctness, free speech, or affirmative action. It is relating to people as authentic human beings, not as representatives of a group or class. Great harm is done when groups of people are stereotyped as having certain characteristics, rather than looking deeper at the individual person.</p><p>Pichai correctly analyzed this as the issue, noting that Damore’s document “crosses the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace.” This violated Google’s code of conduct, thereby triggering his termination.</p><p>In his manifesto, Damore asserted that women have more “openness directed toward feelings and aesthetics rather than ideas, a stronger interest in people rather than things, prefer jobs in social or artistic areas, extraversion expressed as gregariousness rather than assertiveness, and neuroticism, characterized by high anxiety and lower stress tolerance.” As the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://econ.st/2vMFoAP\">Economist magazine</a>&nbsp;pointed out, he justified his assertions by cherry-picking research on gender differences.</p><a href=\"http://econ.st/2vMFoAP\">Economist magazine</a><p>The real risk of Damore’s generalizations, expressed in a business context, is that they give license to people to behave as if those beliefs are true. This can lead to hidden or overt discrimination against women in the workplace. Such stereotypes have been used for decades by majority groups to hold people back and put&nbsp;them down for their race, ethnic origins, sexual preferences, and religion, as well as their gender. The aftermath of the Charlottesville demonstrations by neo-Nazis, KKK, and white supremacists brought these once-hidden issues back to the forefront of social consciousness.</p><p>Stereotyping contributes directly to unconscious bias, a subject about which Mahzarin Banaji, chair of Harvard’s psychology department, has written extensively. In male-dominated environments, these biases keep women from advancing and make their work lives uncomfortable.</p><p>In my experience, Damore’s assertions don’t match the reality in today’s corporate environment. Having worked with female CEOs under enormous pressure, such as General Motors’ Mary Barra, PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi, DuPont’s Ellen Kullman, and Xerox’s Anne Mulcahy and Ursula Burns, I have witnessed firsthand just how well they handle extremely stressful situations. For Damore to say women are more neurotic, anxious, and lack tolerance for stress implies that women cannot handle top leadership jobs.</p><p>Irresponsible generalizations about groups of people lead to individuals being judged by external characteristics such as gender, race, and national origin rather than the authentic person within. As with many complex issues, business leaders must explore these foundational issues of identity with compassion, humility, and sensitivity.</p><p><strong>The real danger from stereotyping</strong></p><strong>The real danger from stereotyping</strong><p>In my classes at Harvard Business School (HBS) many executives express concerns about experiencing these biases in their workplaces. However, we have learned through our executive leadership classes, which put people in diverse groups of six people, that encouraging them to open up and share their authentic selves, life stories, crucibles, and their hopes and dreams enable them to flourish and grow as leaders by feeling fully accepted.</p><p>The real danger of labeling people by their external characteristics is that it robs them of their uniqueness and even their humanity. As employers like Google attempt to create authentic cultures that enable people to be themselves, categorizing them according to their gender, race, or national origin inhibits people from expressing their true feelings and may even cause them to wear masks for fear of being stereotyped.</p><p>As a white American male, I recognize that throughout my life I have been the beneficiary of positive assumptions about my abilities and my potential—assumptions that did not benefit most of my female colleagues. I have not had to overcome discrimination based on my gender or race that many others have faced. Yet, I find Damore’s blanket statements that men prefer things to people; are less open, less extroverted, and less cooperative; have less empathy; and are less interested in work-life balance than women are not necessarily true among today’s corporate leaders. These are the very traits that the authentic leaders in my research —both male and female—strive to achieve.</p><p>It is regrettable that such important issues as workplace culture, creating environments that do not discriminate or stereotype groups of people, or ensuring that all employees have equal opportunities to succeed are being consumed by the larger political debate in our country. The challenges of building healthy workplaces have been with us for many decades. Google is at the forefront of progress in this area, as Laszlo Bock, its human resource head, captured so well in his book,&nbsp;Work Rules. If the controversies stirred up by Damore’s manifesto lead to healthy, open discussions at companies determined to make progress in this complex area, the Google affair will have had a salutary benefit.</p><p>Only by eliminating stereotyping in the workplace—both explicit and implicit—can companies enable employees to be themselves and behave authentically. Add to that the need to judge all individuals on their merits and their performance, not making assumptions about them based on flawed stereotypes. Then companies can create true meritocracies where men and women perform to their full potential.</p><p><em>Bill George&nbsp;is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of&nbsp;Discover Your True North.</em></p><em>Bill George&nbsp;is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of&nbsp;Discover Your True North.</em><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/op-ed-why-google-engineer-deserved-to-be-fired-by-the-ceo\">HBSWK.hbs.edu</a> on 9/14/17.</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/op-ed-why-google-engineer-deserved-to-be-fired-by-the-ceo\">HBSWK.hbs.edu</a> on 9/14/17.</em><a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/op-ed-why-google-engineer-deserved-to-be-fired-by-the-ceo\">HBSWK.hbs.edu</a><div></div>"

      "<p><em>By Bradbury H. Anderson , Richard K. Davis , Michael Dougherty , Bill George and Marilyn Carlson Nelson</em></p><em>By Bradbury H. Anderson , Richard K. Davis , Michael Dougherty , Bill George and Marilyn Carlson Nelson</em><p>Instead of hospitals in neighboring communities like those in Albert Lea and Austin competing, they must collaborate and share certain services. We’re still investing in Albert Lea, and we’ve identified a way to keep 95 percent of the services patients use most at both campuses.</p><p>As current and former public trustees of the Mayo Clinic, we and the Mayo leadership are 100 percent committed to putting the health of patients first throughout southern Minnesota (“Is Mayo living up to Minnesota mission?” editorial, Aug. 26).</p><p>We believe the recent decisions to move overnight hospitalizations, ICU and childbirth services from the Mayo Clinic Health System campus in Albert Lea to the campus in Austin and behavioral health services from Austin to Albert Lea will ensure that Mayo can continue to fulfill that commitment.</p><p>Access to high-quality, affordable health care as close to home as possible is a belief we share with Albert Lea, Austin and all the communities we serve. In shifting select procedures to the nearby hospital in Austin, we are committed to preserving high-quality care in both communities, taking these steps proactively to address some of the many challenges facing rural hospitals nationwide. To accomplish this goal, Mayo is investing $5 million to strengthen the Mayo hospital in Albert Lea in order to make this community a regional hub for in-demand services, including: $720,000 in improvements to the Cancer Center; $600,000 in a new CT scanner; $2.75 million in a new hospital cooling system; an integrated environment for behavioral health care and addiction services; and the building of short-stay observation beds adjacent to the emergency department to reduce transfers to other facilities.</p><p>These were difficult decisions that were made after careful study and analysis, and collaboration with community leaders in order to minimize their impact. The traditional model of duplicate hospitals operating in isolation from nearby locations is unsustainable. Instead of neighboring hospitals competing, they must collaborate and share certain services, not duplicate them. Organizations that fail to respond to similar market conditions often end up closing entire facilities: More than 80 rural hospitals across the country have closed since 2010, with another 670 on the brink. To put Albert Lea and Austin in that position would be irresponsible, especially when we have identified a way to keep 95 percent of the services patients use most at both campuses. These changes will ensure patients’ health and safety, and will provide both communities access to quality care for the long term.</p><p>After careful study and review of the current state as well as future trends of health care in Albert Lea and Austin, the board fully supports these changes on behalf of patients throughout the region. We support local leaders as they work with their communities to manage these changes in ways that minimize their impact and provide for a better health care future for all.</p><p><em>Bradbury H.

      "<p>By Bess Levin</p><p>Last week, in the wake of Donald Trump’s decision not to disavow white nationalists (and assorted Hitlerian fellow travelers), dozens of C.E.O.s who had signed on to the president’s two business councils resigned in protest, with many of them condemning the response from the White House. Not everyone thought that was the right decision though, and on CNBC Tuesday morning, former Office Depot C.E.O. Steve Odland explained why.</p><p>“C.E.O.s have many constituents: customers, employees, owners. And we as a country are split politically, and those constituents are split politically,” Odland said on Squawk Alley. “So, by supporting one aspect of politics you’re by definition going against some of your other constituents. You have to be very careful as a C.E.O.” His fellow guest on the panel, however, didn’t think the c-suite should be so magnanimous. <strong>Former Medtronic C.E.O. Bill George, who was also on the program, disagreed, arguing that groups like the K.K.K. and neo-Nazis should actually be everyone’s line in the sand. “No one should associate with the K.K.K., white supremacists, neo-Nazis,” George said. “These things are not a part of American society you want to ever encourage.”</strong></p><strong>Former Medtronic C.E.O. Bill George, who was also on the program, disagreed, arguing that groups like the K.K.K. and neo-Nazis should actually be everyone’s line in the sand. “No one should associate with the K.K.K., white supremacists, neo-Nazis,” George said. “These things are not a part of American society you want to ever encourage.”</strong><h4>Tax cut-hungry G.O.P. stops pretending to care about deficits</h4><p>Steven Mnuchin’s Hermès-obsessed wife, the physical manifestation of the case for higher taxes, isn’t the only thing standing in the way of Donald Trump’s plan to overhaul the tax code for the first time in 30 years. There is also the small matter of the math involved, which is daunting. Trillions in tax cuts, contra Stephen Moore, do not pay for themselves. In fact, they are almost certain to add a nice chunk of change to the national debt, an issue that, in another day and age, was ostensibly the reason we needed to gut the social safety net. Now, though, with a Republican in office and tax cuts so close corporations can practically taste the savings, Republicans may be willing to be slightly more flexible. What’s an extra 12-figures worth of debt between friends?</p><p>Bloomberg reports that “a growing number of key congressional Republicans are considering a controversial maneuver that would allow for about $450 billion of tax cuts without offsets,” according to congressional staffers familiar with the discussions. Under the proposed plan, things like expiring tax breaks would not have to be accounted for when gauging the impact of the legislation, which recent estimates suggest will cost $7.8 trillion over 10 years. This would give tax writers extra wiggle room, an approach that the House‘s chief tax writer, Kevin Brady, reportedly “signaled openness to” last month as it would “lead to deeper tax cuts.”</p><p>Those less enthused by the proposal are deficit hawks and Democrats, who remember a time when Republicans didn’t want to pay for things like the Children’s Health Insurance Program because they cost too much. In a letter to the Senate Budget Committee’s chairman sent earlier this month, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, having caught wind of the idea, wrote, “We are troubled by reports that the Budget Committee is considering using a so-called ‘current policy’ baseline for tax reform legislation. This decision would represent a huge break in precedent, would weaken budget discipline to allow Congress to add over half a trillion dollars to the debt.”</p><h4>Ray Dalio is afraid</h4><p>Time was, billionaire hedge-fund manager Ray Dalio was thrilled about the prospect of Donald Trump moving into the White House. “Regarding igniting animal spirits, if this administration can spark a virtuous cycle in which people can make money, the move out of cash (that pays them virtually nothing) to risk-on investments could be huge,” the Bridgewater Associates founder wrote excitedly in December. “Regarding attracting capital, Trump’s policies can also have a big impact because businessmen and investors move very quickly away from inhospitable environments to hospitable environments.” Eight months later, though, Dalio is decidedly less enthused. In fact, he’s downright frightened about the direction things are headed, in the era of Donald Trump. How bad does Dalio think things will get? He’s not sure, but at best, he thinks we’ll see four years without any legislative accomplishments. At worst, we get World War III.</p><p>“I believe that a) most realities happen over and over again in slightly different forms, b) good principles are effective ways of dealing with one’s realities, and c) politics will probably play a greater role in affecting markets than we have experienced any time before in our lifetimes but in a manner that is broadly similar to 1937,” Dalio wrote Monday in a blog post published on LinkedIn. “I’m essentially an economic mechanic who focuses on how reality works by studying the cause:effect relations and how they played out in history to help me bet on what’s likely to occur. For reasons previously explained in ‘Populism . . .’ it seems to me that we are now economically and socially divided and burdened in ways that are broadly analogous to 1937. During such times conflicts (both internal and external) increase, populism emerges, democracies are threatened and wars can occur. I can’t say how bad this time around will get. I’m watching how conflict is being handled as a guide, and I’m not encouraged.” Then he casually tossed off the prediction that “conflicts have now intensified to the point that fighting to the death is probably more likely than reconciliation.”</p><p>Still, Dalio says, he sees “no important economic risks on the horizon” and is optimistically hoping “the principles that bind us together are stronger than the ones that divide us.” On the other hand, he’s “tacitly reducing” Bridgewater’s risk on the assumption things will “not [be] handled well.”</p><h4>Wells Fargo C.E.O. tells employees to expect more not-great headlines</h4><p>This September will mark the first anniversary of the revelation that Wells Fargo brokers created millions of unauthorized accounts in their customers’ names. To mark the occasion, the bank told its staff in a memo on Tuesday that in the coming months, they can expect the scandal to grow. That disclosure appeared in a quaint little Q&amp;A section, in response to the question, “I saw that we believe the number of customers with potentially unauthorized accounts may increase significantly. Can you tell me more about why this number may grow?” To which C.E.O. Tim Sloan answered: “Initially, our analysis focused on accounts that were opened during the timeframe of May 2011 to mid-2015. Now we’re completing an expanded retail account analysis for 2009 through 2016, including additional analysis of the original review period. So as our timeframe almost doubles to an eight-year review period, we can expect our totals for accounts and dollars remediated to grow.” (As an internal report commissioned by the bank showed, the fake-account issue may have gone back as far as 2004.)</p><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/ceos-agree-to-disagree-on-giving-racists-a-free-pass\">Vanity Fair</a> on 8/23/17.&nbsp;</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/ceos-agree-to-disagree-on-giving-racists-a-free-pass\">Vanity Fair</a> on 8/23/17.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/08/ceos-agree-to-disagree-on-giving-racists-a-free-pass\">Vanity Fair</a><div></div>"

He was quickly followed by the heads of Under Armour and Intel, and by Wednesday morning the Strategic and Policy Forum agreed to disband after a 45-minute conference call.</p><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2017/08/14/investing/merck-ceo-trump-charlottesville/\">quit</a><p>What exactly does this mean for the president?</p><p>First, the development isn’t likely to change the opinions of Trump’s core base.</p><p>One of his&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-populism-corporatoins-donors-media-228995\">talking points</a>&nbsp;as a candidate was against large corporations outsourcing American jobs, an appeal to working class voters. Corporate donors and media executives were “all part of the same corrupt political establishment,” Trump said.</p><a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-populism-corporatoins-donors-media-228995\">talking points</a><p>Outside of his base however, there could be repercussions where the business world is concerned.</p><p>Trump’s decision to load advisory councils with CEOs was as much an act for symbolism as it was for function. While their influence on policy was dubious, the panels were still good for Trump as far as giving him the appearance of supporting business interests and corporate America.</p><p>Business leaders behind Trump support him for his promises to cut down on regulations and institute meaningful tax reform. This would mean a stronger economy, which for them means a profitable atmosphere for themselves and their shareholders.</p><p>This support came in spite of Trump’s more unpopular policies. Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan put it bluntly in a BBC&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/business-40955784\">report</a>.</p><a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/business-40955784\">report</a><p>“Do I agree with every policy or everything he says? No,” Dimon said. “But he is steering the plane we are on and I’m going to support him.”</p><p>But after Charlottesville, CEOs are finding themselves under more&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-and-the-ceos-1502838617?mod=e2fb\">pressure&nbsp;</a>to publicly renounce the president.</p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trump-and-the-ceos-1502838617?mod=e2fb\">pressure&nbsp;</a><p><strong>Their first duty is to create profit for their companies with as little risk as possible.

But the risk that perception creates is all too real for the former council members, and it didn’t take long for most to jump ship once Mr. Frazier decided he wanted out.</p><p>Trump is already being openly defied in Congress by members of his own party, and his major legislative endeavors have stalled. However, lacking the full support of one’s party is nothing new in politics.</p><p>But losing the backing of business leaders means fewer friends in the private sector for Trump, and the mutiny only further isolates the president and his agenda. If Trump lacks representatives from the business community, his economic policies have less clout with business leaders outside of his personal sphere, which in turn makes it harder for CEOs and other business leaders to accept those policies.</p><p>This, plus the aforementioned defiance from Hill Republicans, only adds to the perception of an administration unable to make any significant headway in Washington. It isn’t likely to help Trump’s low approval&nbsp;<a href=\"http://maristpoll.marist.edu/816-trump-at-lowest-point-with-35-job-approval-rating-crack-at-the-base\">rating</a>&nbsp;either.</p><a href=\"http://maristpoll.marist.edu/816-trump-at-lowest-point-with-35-job-approval-rating-crack-at-the-base\">rating</a><p>All of this is to say the president’s uphill battle for public support now faces yet another obstacle.</p><p>Trump surpassed all expectations in last year’s election. Time will tell if he can weather this latest storm from the business world.</p><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://politicsay.com/2017/08/20/trump-business-advisory-councils-disband/\">politicsay.com</a> on 8/21/17.&nbsp;</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://politicsay.com/2017/08/20/trump-business-advisory-councils-disband/\">politicsay.com</a> on 8/21/17.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://politicsay.com/2017/08/20/trump-business-advisory-councils-disband/\">politicsay.com</a><div></div>"

When these values are violated, even by the president of the United States, they are obliged to take a clear stand.</strong><p>Nothing like this has happened in 50 years.</p><p>Forty-three CEOs of major American corporations revolted against&nbsp;President&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;this week,&nbsp;which led to the shutdown of two presidential advisory councils. In so doing, these&nbsp;leaders&nbsp;may have created an unprecedented gulf between the White House and the business community.</p><p>It all came down to moral leadership. When the president refused to take the lead in speaking out against the demonstration in Charlottesville by neo-Nazis, Ku Klux Klan, and white supremacist groups, America’s CEOs decided this was morally unacceptable. The revolt was led by one of America’s leading CEOs, Merck’s Ken Frazier, who grew up in inner-city Philadelphia and whose grandfather was a South Carolina slave born before the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation.</p><p>Frazier was deeply troubled last Saturday after the events in Charlottesville highlighted the emergence from the shadows of white nationalists. President Trump’s comments striking moral equivalence between these extreme groups and people who opposed them only deepened Frazier’s angst.</p><p>By Sunday Frazier had decided to resign from President Trump’s American Manufacturing Council, and to make a clear statement opposing “hatred, bigotry and group supremacy.” He reviewed his resignation with his corporate team and shared it Sunday night with members of his board of directors, who were fully supportive.</p><p>His announcement Monday morning set off a firestorm, heightened by President Trump’s Twitter post less than one hour later attacking him and Merck.</p><p>By late Monday there were further resignations from the manufacturing group by Under Armour’s Kevin Plank, Intel’s Brian Krzanich, and Alliance for American Manufacturing’s Scott Paul, followed by the AFL-CIO’s Richard Trumka and Thea Lee on Tuesday morning. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon also issued a statement to his company’s 1.5 million American employees sharply criticizing the president for not taking a clear stand against the demonstrators in Charlottesville.</p><p>On Tuesday President Trump again attacked these CEOs on Twitter. But the breaking point came during his Tuesday press conference, when he reverted to his Saturday language, creating a moral equivalence between the alt-right demonstrators and those that opposed them.</p><p>By Tuesday evening, Blackstone’s Steve Schwarzman, chair of the President’s Strategy and Policy Forum, recognized the deep unrest among his members after multiple conversations with them, and decided to call a telephone meeting of the forum members for late Wednesday morning.</p><p>In addition to those who indicated they planned to resign, several members wanted to disband the forum. Soon, the entire group agreed to shut down the forum, effectively resigning en masse. Meanwhile, more members of the manufacturing council resigned, including 3M’s Inge Thulin, Campbell’s Denise Morrison, and GE’s Jeff Immelt. Schwarzman called the White House late Wednesday morning to notify Jared Kushner what was happening. This triggered Trump’s Twitter post that he was ending both councils, “rather than putting pressure on the businesspeople.”</p><p>Taking such public actions was not without risk for the CEOs and their companies. None of them wanted Twitter posts directed at their companies like Frazier and Merck got from the President. Their companies have products dependent on government approvals and major regulatory issues before Congress and the administration.</p><p>Given these issues, what does it take for CEO to speak out against the president? Moral courage.</p><blockquote><p>“TAKING SUCH PUBLIC ACTIONS WAS NOT WITHOUT RISK FOR THE CEOS AND THEIR COMPANIES”</p></blockquote><p>“TAKING SUCH PUBLIC ACTIONS WAS NOT WITHOUT RISK FOR THE CEOS AND THEIR COMPANIES”</p><p>While many CEOs prefer to stay under the radar and avoid public scrutiny, Ken Frazier led the way with his example. As the chair of PhRMA, the pharmaceutical manufacturers association, Frazier has led the initiative for restraint in drug price increases and transparency about prices. He initiated a 32 percent price reduction on one of Merck’s most promising new drugs for Hepatitis C, Zepatier. In addition, he called out industry miscreants like Turing’s Martin Shkreli and Valeant’s Mike Pearson for excessive price increases.</p><p>In today’s era of pragmatic CEOs, moral courage in the form of public statements is rare indeed. With such sharp divisions in the country, any statement at all is certain to incur the wrath of one side or the other. That’s why Frazier’s actions and the subsequent CEO revolt are so significant.</p><p>Today’s CEOs are public figures, with responsibility to uphold their company’s mission and values. When these values are violated, even by someone as powerful as the president of the United States, they are obliged to take a clear stand. In this era of instant global communications and social media, it is no longer possible to hide in the shadows.</p><p>Ken Frazier’s example now resounds. Leaders of all five military branches have made public statements against racism. Republican Congressional leaders are questioning President Trump’s statements on race.</p><p>The ripple effects of Frazier’s courageous stand could change the nation.</p><p><em><strong>Bill George</strong>&nbsp;is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of&nbsp;</em>Discover Your True North.</p><em><strong>Bill George</strong>&nbsp;is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of&nbsp;</em><strong>Bill George</strong><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/op-ed-a-courageous-leader-triggers-a-moral-revolt-of-ceos-against-trump\">HBSWK.com</a> on 8/18/17.&nbsp;</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/op-ed-a-courageous-leader-triggers-a-moral-revolt-of-ceos-against-trump\">HBSWK.com</a> on 8/18/17.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/op-ed-a-courageous-leader-triggers-a-moral-revolt-of-ceos-against-trump\">HBSWK.com</a><div></div>"

He said he felt compelled to speak out on the events, which he found personally troubling, in part because he heard from many people at Apple “who are saddened, outraged or confused.”</p><p>“What occurred in Charlottesville has no place in our country,” he wrote. “We must not witness or permit such hate and bigotry in our country, and we must be unequivocal about it. This is not about the left or the right, conservative or liberal. It is about human decency and morality.”</p><p>Mr. Cook’s memo echoed sentiment expressed in staff memos penned this week by&nbsp;<a class=\"\" href=\"http://quotes.wsj.com/WMT\">Wal-Mart Stores</a>&nbsp;<span class=\"company-name-type\">Inc.</span>&nbsp;CEO Doug McMillon, J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. chief James Dimon and Ernst &amp; Young Global Chairman and CEO Mark Weinberger.

The executives’ overarching message was that they couldn’t remain silent as the president appeared to equate white supremacists and Nazis with counterprotesters standing against racism.</p><p><strong>William W.

Tech executives and workers, many of whom were born abroad, were especially angered by Mr. Trump’s initial immigration order that banned entry to the U.S. of nationals from seven majority-Muslim nations.</p><p>Mr. Cook sent memos to employees about the immigration ban and about Mr. Trump’s June withdrawal from the Paris climate accord, but those emails focused on the company’s support of immigration and the belief that climate change is real. They stopped short of directly criticizing the president as Mr. Cook did in his email this week.</p><p>Mr. Cook’s latest memo also said Apple will contribute $1 million each to the Southern Poverty Law Center and the Anti-Defamation League. The company also plans to match employee contributions 2-for-1 to those organizations and other human-rights groups through next month, and to enable iTunes customers to join in contributing to the Southern Poverty Law Center.</p><p>“These have been dark days, but I remain as optimistic as ever that the future is bright,” Mr. Cook said.</p><p><em>This article was originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/apples-cook-joins-business-leaders-criticizing-trumps-remarks-1502950311\">WSJ.com</a> on 8/18/17.&nbsp;</em></p><em>This article was originally posted on <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/apples-cook-joins-business-leaders-criticizing-trumps-remarks-1502950311\">WSJ.com</a> on 8/18/17.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/apples-cook-joins-business-leaders-criticizing-trumps-remarks-1502950311\">WSJ.com</a><div></div>"

While the media immediately highlighted the significance of Frazier’s statement, the initial reaction from American CEOs was quiet. Only Goldman Sachs’s Lloyd Blankfein and U.K.-based Unilever’s Paul Polman publicly supported him. Blankfein’s Twitter response was especially pointed, quoting Lincoln, “A house divided against itself cannot stand” and adding, “Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence w/ those who bring us together.”</p><p>Behind the scene, the 43 CEOs on the two councils were deeply troubled. During telephone calls between the three female CEOs on the Strategy and Policy Forum – PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi, IBM’s Virginia Rometty and General Motors’ Mary Barra – consideration was given to resigning immediately and encouraging others to do so.

Their companies have products dependent on government approvals and major regulatory issues before Congress and the administration.</p><p>Given these issues, what does it take for CEO to speak out against the president? Moral courage.</p><p>While many CEOs prefer to stay under the radar and avoid public scrutiny, Ken Frazier led the way with his example. As the chair of PhRMA, the pharmaceutical manufacturers association, Frazier has led the initiative for restraint in drug price increases and transparency about prices. He initiated a 32% price reduction on one of Merck’s most promising new drugs for Hepatitis C, Zepatier. In addition, he called out industry miscreants like Turing’s Martin Shkreli and Valeant’s Mike Pearson for excessive price increases.</p><p>In today’s era of pragmatic CEOs, moral courage in the form of public statements is rare indeed. With such sharp divisions in the country, any statement at all is certain to incur the wrath of one side or the other. That’s why Frazier’s actions and the subsequent CEO revolt are so significant.</p><p>Today’s CEOs are public figures, with responsibility to uphold their company’s mission and values. When these values are violated, even by someone as powerful as the president of the United States, they are obliged to take a clear stand. In this era of instant global communications and social media, it is no longer possible to hide in the shadows.</p><p>Ken Frazier’s example now resounds.&nbsp; Leaders of all five military branches have made public statements against racism.&nbsp; Republican Congressional leaders are questioning President Trump’s statements on race.</p><p>The ripple effects of Frazier’s courageous stand could change the nation.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>By Jena McGregor</p><p><em>Read on for Bill’s contribution to McGregor’s piece. </em></p><em>Read on for Bill’s contribution to McGregor’s piece. </em><p>President Trump had a message Tuesday for any chief executive who may be deliberating whether to stay on his advisory councils in the wake of a public outcry about his response to the violence in Charlottesville: If you leave, there are others who can replace you.</p><p>“For every CEO that drops out of the Manufacturing Council,” Trump tweeted. “I have many to take their place. Grandstanders should not have gone on. JOBS!</p><p>The tweet highlights the conundrum CEOs who are members of Trump’s advisory councils have found themselves facing in recent days as they balance the rewards — and growing risks — of being associated with an unpredictable president. Should they remain, keeping their seat at a table that could help them influence policy decisions, rather than possibly passing it up to a competitor? Or should they leave, responding to the online furor of customers, the distraction of political debates or their own feelings about Trump’s response to Charlottesville?</p><p><strong>“A lot of them went onto them thinking this is a pro-business president and we have an opportunity to influence what’s going on,” said Bill George, the former CEO of Medtronic and a professor at Harvard Business School. “Now, for many of them, the actions Trump is taking violate core principles that not only their companies, but they themselves, have.”</strong></p><strong>“A lot of them went onto them thinking this is a pro-business president and we have an opportunity to influence what’s going on,” said Bill George, the former CEO of Medtronic and a professor at Harvard Business School. “Now, for many of them, the actions Trump is taking violate core principles that not only their companies, but they themselves, have.”</strong><p>In other words, CEOs find themselves in the unusual situation of deciding whether remaining on a White House advisory panel — a plum appointment that offers a direct line to the president — is worth what has also become a reputation risk. “For a Republican president to be in dispute with the news media is one thing,” said Bruce Haynes, a founder of the bipartisan corporate reputation firm Purple Strategies who has a background in GOP consulting. “For a Republican president to be in dispute with the business community is not a happy place to be.”</p><p>The furor over the CEOs’ decisions began after Merck CEO Kenneth C. Frazier said in a tweet that he would be resigning from Trump’s manufacturing council. “America’s leaders must honor our fundamental values by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal,” he said.</p><p>Frazier’s announcement followed a weekend when Trump came under fire for not explicitly calling out white supremacy groups for the violent protests in Charlottesville. Trump later made specific mention of the groups Monday, then Tuesday doubled down on his earlier remarks, telling reporters at Trump Tower in New York “there is blame on both sides.”</p><p>During the news conference, he was also asked why he thought CEOs were leaving his manufacturing council. “Because they’re not taking their job seriously as it pertains to this country,” he said. He added that “some of the folks that will leave, they’re leaving out of embarrassment because they make their products outside [the U.S.]. And I’ve been lecturing them, including the gentleman that you’re referring to, about you have to bring it back to this country.”</p><p>Frazier’s move prompted a flurry of questions about whether other CEOs, too, would depart Trump’s manufacturing council, which included 27 members when it was announced in January. Many did not, condemning violence and racism in carefully crafted statements but saying they would stay on to advocate for their workers or represent their industries.</p><p>“I have concluded that Johnson &amp; Johnson has a responsibility to remain engaged, not as a way to support any specific political agenda, but as a way to represent the values of Our Credo as crucial public policy is discussed and developed,” wrote Johnson &amp; Johnson chief executive Alex Gorsky.</p><p>Others went further, critiquing Trump’s response even as their companies said they would remain engaged on a council. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said in an email to employees Monday that Trump “missed a critical opportunity to help bring our country together by unequivocally rejecting the appalling actions of white supremacists.”</p><p>McMillon, though, plans to remain part of the White House’s Strategy and Policy Forum. Others joined Frazier: Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank, Intel CEO Brian Krzanich and Scott Paul, president of the nonprofit group Alliance for American Manufacturing, each resigned from a manufacturing council, citing different reasons. Intel’s Krzanich, for instance, wrote that “I resigned to call attention to the serious harm our divided political climate is causing to critical issues,” while Paul simply said he was resigning “because it is the right thing for me to do.”</p><p>Soon after that press conference on Tuesday, the AFL-CIO released a statement saying its representatives on the council, Richard Trumka and Thea Lee, had also resigned. “We cannot sit on a council for a president who tolerates bigotry and domestic terrorism,” the statement read. “President Trump’s remarks today repudiate his forced remarks yesterday about the KKK and neo-Nazis.” (In a statement, Reed Cornish, assistant to the president, said “under this president, we’ve seen 70,000 new manufacturing jobs, record optimism among manufacturers and unemployment hit a 16-year low.”)</p><p>One former presidential adviser asked Tuesday why more didn’t go along with them. Lawrence H. Summers, who served as treasury secretary to President Bill Clinton and an economic adviser to President Barack Obama, wrote in an op-ed Tuesday that “every member of Mr. Trump’s advisory councils should wrestle with his or her conscience” and that “after this weekend, I am not sure what it would take to get the CEOs to resign. Demonizing ethnic groups? That has happened. Renouncing international agreements that have supported business interests? That has happened.”</p><p>Some management experts thought more could still resign, but they may go more quietly, whether to avoid being accused as “grandstanding” by the president or to keep from drawing attention. “For a lot of CEOs, it’s got to seem inevitable that this is going to keep happening,” said Aaron Chatterji, a professor at Duke’s Fuqua School of Business who worked with CEOs as part of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers.</p><p><strong>Those who decide to remain could be weighing how much of their business is exposed to regulatory changes or government contracting decisions. With a president who likes to pride himself on personal dealmaking and appears to operate under “the theory of whoever’s the last person to speak with him influences the decision,” said George, staying on may be worth it, particularly with key agenda items like tax revision and infrastructure still on the horizon.</strong></p><strong>Those who decide to remain could be weighing how much of their business is exposed to regulatory changes or government contracting decisions. With a president who likes to pride himself on personal dealmaking and appears to operate under “the theory of whoever’s the last person to speak with him influences the decision,” said George, staying on may be worth it, particularly with key agenda items like tax revision and infrastructure still on the horizon.</strong><p>But those potential benefits must be balanced by a growing expectation of companies to take a stand on social issues. The debate about CEOs and Trump’s councils flared online in recent days as some tweeted lists of which CEOs had departed, directly appealed to corporate Twitter accounts for their CEOs to leave, or shared the hashtag #QuittheCouncil, a campaign by the online civil rights organization Color for Change. That hashtag accrued more than 28 million impressions over the past two days, according to data from the analytics firm Brandwatch.</p><p>Julie Hootkin, a partner at the communications firm Global Strategy Group, said their surveys have found that 84 percent of Americans say businesses have a responsibility to work for change on societal issues. Millennial employees have also been shown to value “activist” CEOs. “What many companies are grappling with is there are things that are important to their employees that may be different than what’s important to the bottom line,” she said.</p><p>In the end, the CEOs — and their boards — will have to believe Trump’s councils are worth their time. Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean for leadership studies at the Yale School of Management, said “too many of them are sitting there like potted plants, being used for P.R. photo opps and insisting afterward their presence is not an implied endorsement.”</p><p>CEOs complain a lot about the distractions that activist investors bring, he said, “but that pales in comparison to the time that’s going into Washington these days. If they don’t feel they get much in return, then is it worth it?”</p><p><em>This content was originally posted a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2017/08/15/in-trumps-white-house-a-plum-appointment-for-ceos-has-become-a-reputation-risk/?utm_term=.8c79e330d85c\">WashingtonPost.com</a> on 8/16/17. </em></p><em>This content was originally posted a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2017/08/15/in-trumps-white-house-a-plum-appointment-for-ceos-has-become-a-reputation-risk/?utm_term=.8c79e330d85c\">WashingtonPost.com</a> on 8/16/17. </em><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/on-leadership/wp/2017/08/15/in-trumps-white-house-a-plum-appointment-for-ceos-has-become-a-reputation-risk/?utm_term=.8c79e330d85c\">WashingtonPost.com</a><div></div>"

What about the alt-left that came charging at the alt-right — do they have any semblance of guilt?”</p><p>Less than one hour after Frazier posted his resignation on Merck’s website, President Trump attacked Frazier in a tweet, saying, “He will have more time to LOWER RIPOFF DRUG PRICES!”</p><p>Ironically, as chairman of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, Frazier has been the leader in urging restraint in pharmaceutical prices, being the first company to offer <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/01/29/merck-drug-price-hikes/\">transparency on its prices</a> from 2010 to 2016, and calling out miscreants like Turing Pharmaceuticals’ Martin Shkreli and Valeant’s Mike Pearson. Commenting on President Trump’s tweet, CNBC’s Jim Cramer suggested that the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/08/14/jim-cramer-on-tweet-attacking-merck-ceo-ken-frazier-deserves-better-trump-should-apologize.html\">president owed Frazier an apology</a>.</p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/01/29/merck-drug-price-hikes/\">transparency on its prices</a><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2017/08/14/jim-cramer-on-tweet-attacking-merck-ceo-ken-frazier-deserves-better-trump-should-apologize.html\">president owed Frazier an apology</a><p>The courageous stand these CEOs took raises the question: When should corporate leaders speak out on vital issues? What risks do they take, such as incurring the wrath of the president?</p><p>In recent months, we have been witnessing more and more leaders taking public stands on important issues. When President Trump withdrew America from the Paris Climate Agreement in June, Jeff Immelt, then the CEO of General Electric (now chairman), tweeted, “Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on the government.” CEOs Bob Iger of Disney and Elon Musk of Tesla <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/disney-ceo-iger-quits-trump-council-over-climate-decision.html\">immediately resigned from the President’s Strategy and Policy Forum</a> following that decision.</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/06/01/disney-ceo-iger-quits-trump-council-over-climate-decision.html\">immediately resigned from the President’s Strategy and Policy Forum</a><p>These CEOs are walking a fine line between staying engaged by serving on presidential councils and resigning as a statement of principle over actions by public officials that run counter to their company’s values and principles. In today’s complex world, CEOs are looked to as standard bearers on important policy issues for their companies, while also representing multiple constituencies, often with conflicting views. It is in the nuance of making these tradeoffs that their true leadership is determined.</p><p>Given the importance of issues like health care, global trade, climate change, and corporate taxes, CEOs and their teams need to have access to the policy makers in Congress and the White House in order explain how these issues impact their businesses. At the same time they are charged with upholding the company’s principles.</p><p>In Merck’s case, Frazier must reflect the needs of millions of Merck’s global patients and customers, as well as the interests of 55,000 employees around the world. These constituencies are highly diverse, reflecting every race, religion, and nationality, as well as gender, sexual orientation and political beliefs — all of which were cited by Frazier in his statement of resignation. Meanwhile, shareholders have their stake in the company and its financial well-being, as do many health care groups. How can CEOs like Frazier navigate these complexities?</p><p>I believe business leaders should base their stands on the company’s mission and its values. If these are violated, then they have an obligation to speak publicly. Frazier felt the offense of extremists in Charlottesville this past weekend required a strong stand from the president against white supremacists and neo-Nazis, one that was not forthcoming. So did <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes?symbol=GS\">Goldman Sachs</a> CEO Lloyd Blankfein.</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes?symbol=GS\">Goldman Sachs</a><p>Minutes after Frazier’s statement and Trump’s rejoinder, Blankfein posted his own tweet, quoting Lincoln, “‘A house divided against itself cannot stand.’ Isolate those who try to separate us. No equivalence with those who bring us together.”</p><p>If their positions are based on their company’s principles, not just self-interest, then these leaders are on solid ground, even if they incur the wrath of some policy makers and constituents.</p><p>Apple’s Tim Cook and Salesforce’s Marc Benioff have repeatedly spoken out against discrimination against gays and anti-LGBT policies in North Carolina and Indiana. Last week, Google CEO Sundar Pichai t<a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/10/how-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-decided-to-fire-james-damore.html\">erminated employee James Damore for his 10-page manifesto</a> that Pichai said “crosses the line by advancing harmful gender stereotypes in our workplace,” such as suggesting that women are neurotic, characterized by high anxiety and lower stress tolerance.</p><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/10/how-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-decided-to-fire-james-damore.html\">erminated employee James Damore for his 10-page manifesto</a><p>As the public dialogue becomes more divisive, I anticipate that more business leaders will be taking public stands on behalf of the people and organizations they represent. I admire their courage and willingness to do so. Even when we disagree with them, we should be respectful of their bravery to stand up and be counted when the issues matter the most.</p><p><em>This content originally appeared on <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/15/expect-more-ceos-to-speak-out-on-vital-issues-risking-the-wrath-of-the-trump-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a> on 8/15/17.</em></p><em>This content originally appeared on <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/15/expect-more-ceos-to-speak-out-on-vital-issues-risking-the-wrath-of-the-trump-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a> on 8/15/17.</em><a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2017/08/15/expect-more-ceos-to-speak-out-on-vital-issues-risking-the-wrath-of-the-trump-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a><div></div>"

      "<p>In his last earnings call as CEO, Jeff Immelt announced yet another disappointing quarter for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/quotes?symbol=GE\">General Electric</a>. The pressure now mounts on Immelt’s successor, John Flannery, to put the company back on track. GE’s market capitalization tumbled $170 billion during Immelt’s tenure. This year alone, GE stock is down some 18 percent, while the S&amp;P index is up almost 10 percent.</p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/quotes?symbol=GE\">General Electric</a><p>When GE surprised its investors in May by announcing its CEO transition, Flannery promised an immediate review of GE’s portfolio by November, noting, “Focus on the cost, and margin and cash, and then where do you focus the company.” Such a financially-oriented approach may please GE’s investors in the near-term, but it begs the vastly more important question: What business&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;GE in? Does GE have a unifying purpose other than making money?</p><em>is</em><p>GE did not become the most iconic American company through financial engineering or margin analysis. While Flannery can create near-term value by focusing GE’s business, he must look beyond immediate financial returns to build an enduring enterprise. Otherwise, GE risks becoming a holding company that buys and sells businesses opportunistically with no dominant strengths. If Flannery’s mission for GE is simply a set of financial metrics, he will put the company on the opposite side of great, enduring companies like PepsiCo, ExxonMobil, Goldman Sachs, Mayo Clinic, and Merck.</p><p>For GE to lead American industry for the next century, Flannery needs to determine an over-arching corporate strategy that leverages GE’s global strengths to create sustainable competitive advantage. Then he needs to determine how to translate those strengths into leading market positions for each of its businesses through innovation and operational excellence. That’s the only way GE can achieve superior long-term financial results.</p><p>For decades GE has set the standard for the business community through the direction of the company. When Jack Welch took over leadership in 1981, he immediately undid the work of his predecessor, Reginald Jones, declaring that all GE businesses had to be No. 1 or No. 2 in their respective industries or risk being sold off. Welch quickly disposed of Utah International, Jones’s largest acquisition. Then he streamlined the organization, taking out multiple layers of line and staff managers. Welch proceeded to build the most successful conglomerate of the 20<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;Century, with high-performing industrial businesses ranging from appliances to jet engines, balanced by high growth, high return financial businesses in GE Capital.</p><sup>th</sup><p>“Such a financially-oriented approach may please GE’s investors in the near-term, but it begs the vastly more important question: What business is GE in? Does GE have a unifying purpose other than making money?”</p><p>Perhaps only a remarkable leader like Welch, with his incredible mastery of the details of every GE business, could run such a complex enterprise. Welch drove the businesses not only with a clear eye on near-term performance but through focused corporate initiatives like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ge.com/en/company/companyinfo/quality/whatis.htm\">Six Sigma</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ge.com/pdf/company/governance/ge_comp_gov_ovrvw08.pdf\">Session C</a>&nbsp;that built management and leadership capabilities deep into the GE organization. Part of Welch’s legacy is seen in the successful careers of GE alumni such as Dave Cote (Honeywell), Kevin Sharer (Amgen), Jim McNerny (Boeing), and Omar Ishrak (Medtronic).</p><a href=\"http://www.ge.com/en/company/companyinfo/quality/whatis.htm\">Six Sigma</a><a href=\"http://www.ge.com/pdf/company/governance/ge_comp_gov_ovrvw08.pdf\">Session C</a><p>By the end of Welch’s 20-year tenure, GE Capital accounted for 52 percent of GE’s earnings. Security analysts loved GE’s consistently strong results and earnings flexibility, but also began referring derisively to GE as “a bank.” As Welch’s successor, Jeff Immelt knew he needed to lessen GE’s dependence on its financial arm and return it to its manufacturing roots, but he was reluctant to undo Welch’s legacy.</p><p>Immelt’s hesitancy led to the liquidity crisis GE faced in 2008, triggered by the banking collapse. Immelt had to ask President George Bush to bail out what was once the world’s most valuable company. Bush stepped up with a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/businesspro-us-ge-idUSTRE4AC0JJ20081113\">$139 billion</a>&nbsp;lifeline, putting GE into the same category as AIG, Merrill Lynch, and Citigroup – not a club in which GE intended to be.</p><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/businesspro-us-ge-idUSTRE4AC0JJ20081113\">$139 billion</a><p>Immelt may have moved too slowly, but he largely dismantled “the house that Jack built,” selling off most of GE Capital, divesting NBC, and spinning off legacy businesses like appliances, plastics and lighting. In recent years Immelt has remade GE as a high-tech, large systems company, building GE’s expertise in energy systems, jet engines, and health systems. Yet it has been anything but a smooth ride, as volatility in oil prices has dragged down GE’s energy business.</p><p>Meanwhile, GE is running well behind industrial competitors like Honeywell, United Technologies, and Danaher. Their revenue growth, earnings, and stock prices have easily outpaced GE because they are committed to their core markets, never vacillating about their high-tech, market-leading businesses.</p><p>While Immelt’s strategy was directionally correct, impatient investors, frustrated after 16 years of lagging results, thought it was too little, too late. The GE board decided it was time for a change and chose Flannery to refocus GE on near-term results and immediate cash flow.</p><p>Now Flannery must decide what GE’s core business is. Is Flannery willing to invest heavily in the high-tech future Immelt envisioned? Or will he continue to dismantle the company, turning GE into a typical industrial company that grows at the rate of the economy and delivers a high proportion of its free cash flow to short-term investors? The answer will determine whether GE can sustain itself through economic crises and still lead American industry for the next 100 years.</p><p>Flannery may be tempted to take this near-term view advocated by many GE investors, looking at each business purely through a financial lens. But too much surgery could kill the patient. Without a compelling purpose that inspires customers, employees, and shareholders, GE will lose its leadership position in American industry – an enormous loss for America’s most iconic global business.</p><p><em>Commentary by Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and the author of “Discover Your True North.” Follow him on Twitter&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Bill_George\">@Bill_George</a>.</em></p><em>Commentary by Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and the author of “Discover Your True North.” Follow him on Twitter&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Bill_George\">@Bill_George</a>.</em><a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Bill_George\">@Bill_George</a><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/24/heres-the-dilemma-for-ges-new-ceo-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a> on 7/24/17. </em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/24/heres-the-dilemma-for-ges-new-ceo-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a> on 7/24/17. </em><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/24/heres-the-dilemma-for-ges-new-ceo-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a><div></div>"

    "post_date": "July 19, 2017",
    "post_content": [
      "<p>As America recedes from global leadership under President Donald Trump’s “America First” policies, a new generation of business statesmen is stepping up to take on global issues of monumental importance: global trade, climate change, job creation, and healthy living.</p><p>At the G20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, earlier this month, President Trump was “odd man out” on both global trade and climate change. China, Russia, and India joined the European nations in fostering global trading commitments and climate change. As Trump pulled the United States back, cynics started referring to the G20 as the G19 + 1.</p><p>For business leaders, the early optimism following Trump’s election that corporate taxes would be reduced, America’s infrastructure would be improved, and an improved healthcare system would be created has faded away. Many business leaders find President Trump’s statements on trade, climate change, NATO, immigration, and energy in direct opposition to what they need to build their companies. As a result, they are stepping up to take the lead on vital global issues.</p><p><strong>Business leaders have a history of stepping in</strong></p><strong>Business leaders have a history of stepping in</strong><p>This is the fourth time in my lifetime that CEOs have rallied to take on important causes. The first came during World War II and its aftermath when the future of the world hung in the balance and depended heavily on the capabilities of American business. The second came in the late 1960s when riots in major cities like Los Angeles, Detroit, and Washington, DC, woke CEOs to the reality that race issues in major metropolitan cities had to be addressed. The third instance came in the 1990s when global opportunities arose for US-based companies to lead their respective industries through a sustained period of growth.</p><p>This latest awakening, characterized by the outspokenness of business leaders, marks a sharp break with the past 15 years when CEOs kept their heads down to concentrate on running their own businesses. In part, they were reacting to the challenges of the Great Recession as well as the meltdowns of Enron, Arthur Andersen, and WorldCom. Those tumultuous times forced CEOs to focus on cost-cutting and strategic reorientation. As corporate earnings recovered following the recession, CEOs have maintained very disciplined spending levels and shared their growing cash flows with investors in the form of share buybacks.</p><p>However, these leaders are wise enough to know they cannot simply cut their way to prosperity. To sustain earnings growth, global companies need US government policies that support global growth. That’s why they are focusing now on issues like job creation, favorable trade relations, economic growth, and corporate tax reform that are essential for sustaining earnings growth and shareholder returns.</p><p>Concerned about the future of their global businesses, many of them are determined to go their own way. As GE CEO Jeff Immelt wrote when the president announced the US withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement, “Climate change is real. Industry must now lead and not depend on government.”</p><p>Immelt is not alone. Never before in modern history has the business community so uniformly opposed an action by any president, Democrat or Republican. CEOs speaking out against Trump’s climate decision ranged from energy executives like Exxon’s Darren Woods, Dow’s Andrew Liveris, and Tesla’s Elon Musk to Disney’s Bob Iger and JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon. Iger and Musk immediately resigned from the group of powerful CEOs making up Trump’s Strategy and Policy Forum. Goldman’s Lloyd Blankfein even created a Twitter account in order to issue his first tweet objecting to the President’s decision.</p><p><strong>A responsibility to be heard</strong></p><strong>A responsibility to be heard</strong><p>Immelt’s statement is a clarion call to all CEOs to engage personally in public policy issues. The climate agreement is only one of their many concerns. Many CEOs are assuming leadership for global issues essential to their business strategies. For example, PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi is advocating for healthier foods, and Unilever’s Paul Polman continues to champion greater sustainability. Health care executives are voicing vigorous public opposition to the Republican health care bill pending in the Senate.</p><p>In late June, 17 high-tech CEOs, including Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Microsoft’s Satya Nadella, and IBM’s Ginni Rometty, met with President Trump to talk about modernizing government technology. For these CEOs, hiring skilled workers, global trade, and H1B visas were also high on their agendas.</p><p>Technology executives such as Apple’s Tim Cook and Salesforce’s Marc Benioff have voiced their concerns about the impact Trump’s immigration policies are having on hiring skilled workers, as well as chastising former Republican governors Indiana’s Mike Pence (now vice president) and North Carolina’s Pat McCrory for enacting anti-LGBT policies in their states.</p><p>In the last four months, US hiring has dropped to a meager 150,000 new hires per month, 17% lower than the 2016 monthly average of 180,000, in spite of the president’s vocal support for hiring in America. At the end of May, the number of unfilled jobs (6.04 million) nearly equaled the number of unemployed Americans (6.45 million).</p><p>There is a “skills mismatch” between what workers can contribute and what companies need from their employees. To address this, the president recently announced his backing of job training and apprenticeship programs, although no specifics have been announced. Benioff has taken up the apprenticeship cause with the goal of creating five million training jobs. In June, a group of 82 CEOs on the Business Roundtable took out full-page advertisements in the Wall Street Journal and New York Times supporting Trump’s proposed apprenticeship programs.</p><p>Will this upsurge in CEO engagement last, or is it merely a passing thing? From talking regularly with myriad CEOs, I am convinced it is here to stay. America’s CEOs know what is at stake: nothing less than America’s leadership in the global world. America is blessed with corporate leaders whose companies dominate their global markets and who know the imperative of global industry leadership.</p><p>They also know a leadership vacuum when they see one, and they recognize how important their voices are at this vital turning point in US history. That’s why they are stepping up now to address these complex global issues.</p><p>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of “Discover Your True North.”</p><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/as-america-recedes-from-global-leadership-its-ceos-are-stepping-up\">HBSWK.hbs.edu</a> on 7/19/17. </em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/as-america-recedes-from-global-leadership-its-ceos-are-stepping-up\">HBSWK.hbs.edu</a> on 7/19/17. </em><a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/as-america-recedes-from-global-leadership-its-ceos-are-stepping-up\">HBSWK.hbs.edu</a><div></div>"

      "<p>This May my wife Penny and I and friends trekked 100 miles in nine days across Portugal and Spain on the famous Camino de Santiago de Compostela, also known as “The Way.” Along with thousands of others, we were pilgrims on a journey through life. Some were there for religious purposes, some for a spiritual experience, and some were just seeking solitude or a physical challenge.</p><p>Our journey began in Porto, from which we headed due north in search of our True North. We followed the yellow arrows pointing north, and observed the direction of the scallop shells that ancient pilgrims have followed for centuries to the Cathedral of Santiago (St. James in English, St. Jacques in French).</p><p>In our van to the starting point south of Ponte de Lima we passed the monastery of Bragga, site of David Whyte’s poem “The Faces of Bragga,” that proposes we accept all our flaws as an integral part of who we are so that we can live authentically. That night we stayed in a beautiful manor house owned by a count whose family name is that of the town. The count gave us a personal tour of his 14 C. home.</p><p>The next day we started the countdown from south of Valencia, Portugal and KM marker 112. &nbsp;On the Camino we walked through beautiful vineyards, smelled gorgeous roses, wisteria, and honeysuckle plants, visited and prayed in chapels and churches on the path, climbed to the top of a Celtic village, and walked along beautiful streams and rivers, through forests and fields, and many villages and towns.</p><p>For my part this pilgrimage was metaphor for life: each of us is on our own separate journeys through life. We each had our own unique experience as we continually intersected with fellow pilgrims on their journeys. Just as we encounter obstacles in our journey through life, on our path we faced many obstacles from climbing hills to the dangers of walking alongside highways with fast-moving vehicles, crossing rapid-flowing rivers, and baking in 90+ sun, along with tired legs and bodies.</p><p>At one point I walking alone and lost track of my fellow pilgrims and the scallop shells guiding us. I had to find my way back to the route with no map or ability to ask for help in Spanish until a nice man pointed to a little used path through the woods. This also is a metaphor for the times in life when we lose our way, and look to others for help to get back on track.</p><p>One of the people in our group courageously walked the entire way with the difficulties of Parkinson’s disease, while another suffered from advanced rheumatoid arthritis. One man in his 80<sup>th</sup> year kept the pace the entire journey with the younger pilgrims. No one ever complained about the challenges.</p><sup>th</sup><p>Each of us had our own special purpose for being there. One man said he was praying for a miracle for a friend. Another for healing. Some to honor the death of a loved one. Or help for a friend in need. I cannot honestly say that I had any great awakening or transformation on my pilgrimage. Rather my pilgrimage served as a deepening of my faith, reinforcing my desire to live an authentic life, and renewing my commitment to make a difference in the lives of others.</p><p>Our arrival at the Cathedral of Santiago de Compostela was not the end point of our journey but an essential waystation that enabled us to reflect on its meaning. At the cathedral are the remains of St. James the Great, whose body was discovered in the 9<sup>th</sup> century. There we were constantly reminded of the scallop shell as the symbol of St. James and of our journeys.</p><sup>th</sup><p>At the Pilgrim’s Museum next to the Cathedral, the pilgrimage was described as: “an allegory to express the similarity between a journey to a holy place and human life itself. The physical effort to reach the pilgrim’s goal is a metaphor for the human spiritual journey, full of sacrifices, abnegation and heartache. Depending on one’s particular belief system, its objective is to reach the highest level of knowledge, spiritual renewal, glory, paradise or eternal salvation.”</p><p>Pilgrimages like the one we took are described in most major religions. Members of the Jewish faith make pilgrimages to Jerusalem, Muslims to Mecca, and Christians to Jerusalem, Rome and Santiago. Buddhism describes the inner journey to reach “nirvana,” and Taoism is defined as the “way to perfection.”</p><p>So I ask you, where are you in your journey through life? How are you approaching the obstacles you are encountering in your life? What fellow pilgrims are you helping on their journeys? Who is there to help you on yours?</p><p>In the deeper answers we seek to these questions we will find the meaning and purpose of our lives. After all, life’s greatest tragedy would be to sleepwalk through life, not take time to search for its meaning, engage fellow travelers, or stop and smell the flowers along the way.</p><div></div>"

    "post_content": [
      "<p>Prince Harry recently shared the poignant story of his near-breakdown over his mother Diana’s death. For 20 years he attempted to bury his grief, using honorable military service and wild partying to avoid thinking about his loss. But that only led him astray. While the public tried to escape the searing memories, Prince Harry enlisted in the British Army, where he served for 10 years, including two tours in Afghanistan. But he also embarrassed the royal family with well-publicized drinking, partying, and a viral Las Vegas binger that included nude photos of the prince.</p><p>Thanks to advice from Prince William, he sought professional counseling and is now on the road to recovery. Like others who experience crucibles, Prince Harry tried to avoid thinking about his loss – but his active mind kept bringing it back all the time. His story reminds us all to cope with our crucibles, fully process grief to make sense of it before turning it into personal growth and flourishing.</p><p>Needless to say, Prince Harry is not alone. After the publication of True North in 2007, I received a moving letter from Pedro Algorta, one of 16 survivors of the airplane crash in the Andes Mountains chronicled by Piers Paul Read in his book and movie, Alive. Pedro and his colleagues spent 70 days in the mountains struggling to stay alive without food or water. For 35 years, Pedro buried his crucible. At Stanford Business School, he didn’t tell anyone about his ordeal. But the experiences kept coming back. By processing them, he discovered his True North and embarked on a new career of sharing his story and helping others grow from their crucibles.</p><p>Pedro cites three ways to deal with his severe trials, of which I recommend the last one:</p><ul>\n<li>Be the victim by living your life looking backward, with anger and blame about what happened to you.</li>\n<li>Live your life as if nothing happened, while the memories and pain remain buried inside you.</li>\n<li>Use the event to transform your wound into a pearl.</li>\n</ul><li>Be the victim by living your life looking backward, with anger and blame about what happened to you.</li><li>Live your life as if nothing happened, while the memories and pain remain buried inside you.</li><li>Use the event to transform your wound into a pearl.</li><p>The sad thing about being the victim is you never feel you can trust others and lead a normal life. Burying your crucible doesn’t work either, as it will constantly resurface, often in the least appropriate ways. Reframing the event to turn its pain into a growth experience can show you the way to your life’s purpose, and enable you to use your hardships to help others.</p><p>Take Harvard student Taylor Carol who was diagnosed with terminal cancer at age 11 and was told he had only two weeks to live. He survived a horrendous series of treatments, and missed four years of education. Told by a guidance counselor he should skip high school and instead gain a graduate equivalent degree, he insisted he wanted to attend Harvard. Now 21 years old, he graduates from Harvard this month. Asked how his battle with terminal cancer affected him, he said, “After beating cancer, I resolved to use my singing, my words, and every ounce of my life force to glorify God. I aspire to change the world with my words and voice by pursing my career as a singer/songwriter.”</p><p>It doesn’t take a crucible as extreme as Taylor’s or Prince Harry’s or Pedro’s to have a dramatic impact on your life. We all have our crucibles – at least one struggle in life illustrated by the metaphor of a hot container. In reality, the severe trials in our lives may emanate from what seems to be rather trivial experiences. Years ago, one of my students shared in her paper how a seemingly minor moment had haunted her. In 9th grade, a boy looked at her, rolled his eyes and sneered, making her feel like a loser.</p><p>She described how she tried to seduce people by trading her authenticity for a cheerful veneer in order to gain others’ approval. She became increasingly depressed. One day she put a gun in her mouth and was ready to pull the trigger when her mother walked into her bedroom and saw to her horror what was happening. Years of therapy enabled her to grow from this experience and ultimately led to a sense of well-being.</p><p>Another student, who was from Europe, shared with me that being sexually abused by a priest as a young teen cost him 15 years of his life. He got involved with drugs and alcohol to bury his shame. By joining Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), he was able to give up both alcohol and drugs and recognize he wasn’t at fault for what had happened. This led to a productive career track and a fulfilling marriage.</p><p>My own early crucible was less dramatic, but it played a formative role in my life. When I was 10, my father told me he wanted me to become the leader he had failed to be. I bought into this expectation and joined numerous organizations. I ran for office seven times in high school and college, and lost all seven. Seeing myself as a loser, I was crushed when some seniors at Georgia Tech told me, “Bill, no one is ever going to want to work with you, much less be led by you, because you are moving so fast you never take time for other people.”</p><p>Their feedback enabled me to realize I was seeking titles to gain people’s esteem rather than helping other people. After taking time for self-reflection and gaining honest feedback, I was able to change my relationships and help other people and later was selected for many leadership roles in college and graduate school.</p><p>Understanding yourself at a deeper level requires the courage to face life’s difficulties and discover your True North. Knowing that gives you the courage to navigate successfully life’s greatest challenges.</p><p>Don’t bury your crucible. Face it head on. See what you can learn from it and let it guide you to a more fulfilling life.</p><hr><p>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of the book, Discover Your True North.</p><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/05/09/advice-on-grief-prince-harry/\">Fortune.com</a> on 3/9/17.&nbsp;</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/05/09/advice-on-grief-prince-harry/\">Fortune.com</a> on 3/9/17.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/05/09/advice-on-grief-prince-harry/\">Fortune.com</a><div></div>"

      "<p>Thursday’s 217-213 <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/04/republican-obamacare-replacement-bill-wins-enough-votes-to-pass-house.html\">vote in the House</a> to repeal Obamacare and replace it with the Republicans’ new health-care plan constitutes one of the largest wealth transfers in history from the poor and middle class to wealthy Americans. This will further exacerbate economic disparities in our country. Even worse, the health of our nation will likely decline from its already perilous state, as far fewer Americans will have adequate health insurance.</p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/04/republican-obamacare-replacement-bill-wins-enough-votes-to-pass-house.html\">vote in the House</a><p>The “repeal and replace” vote represents an enormous political win for President <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a> and House Speaker <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/paul-ryan/\">Paul Ryan</a>, coming on the heels of a previous attempt in March that failed. They can justifiably take credit for following through on their campaign pledge, but will also face the wrath of the American public if the new health plan causes further health problems for the American people. The health-care debate now shifts to the U.S. Senate, where a vastly different bill is expected to emerge as skeptical senators focus on the implications of the House plan.</p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/paul-ryan/\">Paul Ryan</a><p>The American Health Care Act (AHCA) poses significant risk for many of the 300 million Americans who will face disruption in their health-care insurance for the second time in the past decade. Most of the recent debate in the House focused on the lack of coverage for pre-existing conditions. The bill includes just $23 billion as support for up to 110,000 people with pre-existing conditions, or 5 percent of the 2.2 million Americans in this category. But the greater issue is whether millions of Americans will have any affordable coverage at all.</p><p>“All the bill accomplishes is to shift the burden of paying for health care from the wealthy and healthy to middle class and unhealthy citizens.”</p><p>In spite of significant changes in the March bill to win support from the right-wing Freedom Caucus and modest concessions for moderates, Republican House leaders intentionally did not ask the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to analyze its financial impact — which will have to be done before the Senate votes. Using the most recent CBO projections, 24 million fewer Americans will have health insurance under AHCA than Obamacare, and wealthy Americans, health plans and pharmaceutical companies will receive an $885 billion tax cut. These projections will likely get worse under the House-approved plan.</p><p>To be clear, this bill does nothing to improve the health of Americans. Nor does it reduce the staggering cost of health care, or lessen its inexorable rise. The likelihood is that the overall health of our citizens will get worse, especially among those who cannot afford the full coverage they have today, including a large proportion of Trump voters. All the bill accomplishes is to shift the burden of paying for health care from the wealthy and healthy to middle class and unhealthy citizens.</p><p>It also changes the focus of health care from the federal government to the states, many of whom will design their own plans. This is consistent with Republican principles, but it will lead to greater health disparities between the states. Having a state and local focus is not a bad thing per se, as states may be better able to design plans for their residents than living with the “one size fits all” plans under Obamacare.</p><p>Many states will eagerly eliminate federal mandates in the current plan and coverage for pre-existing conditions. Alternatively, they will put people with pre-existing conditions into high-risk pools, where coverage may cost up to five times as much as it does today because there are no healthy people in their insurance pool to balance out the premiums. Their pools will be like automobile insurance pools for teenagers who have had prior DWIs — an enormous sum that many lower-income Americans cannot afford. Or they may face annual or lifetime caps on reimbursement or be forced into high-deductible plans where they cannot afford to pay the deductibles.</p><p>While AHCA fulfills one of President Trump’s promises — repealing Obamacare — it will not meet three of his commitments to: 1) provide health care for everyone with pre-existing conditions, 2) lower health care premiums and costs, and 3) avoid reductions in Medicaid coverage. Instead, AHCA cuts Medicaid, makes health care unaffordable for many people with pre-existing conditions, and raises insurance premiums for many “like-for-like” plans.</p><p>In spite of these very significant problems, there is the hope that the private market — employers, health plans, and providers — will continue the momentum that has been building since the passage of Obamacare in 2010, and lead the way in improving the health of the American people. If they don’t, expect the country to undergo yet another upheaval in health care under the next president.</p><hr size=\"2\"><p>This article was originally published on 5/5/17 on <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/05/heres-the-real-loser-in-the-gop-health-care-reform-plan-commentary.html\">cnbc.com</a>.</p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/05/05/heres-the-real-loser-in-the-gop-health-care-reform-plan-commentary.html\">cnbc.com</a><div></div>"

      "<p>Courage&nbsp;is the quality that distinguishes great leaders from excellent managers.</p><p>Over the past decade, I have worked with and studied more than 200 CEOs of major companies through board service, consulting, and research as a member of Harvard Business School’s faculty. I’ve found the defining characteristic of the best ones is courage to make bold moves that transform their businesses.</p><p>Courageous leaders take risks that go against the grain of their organizations. They make decisions with the potential for revolutionary change in their markets. Their boldness inspires their teams, energizes customers, and positions their companies as leaders in societal change.</p><p>The dictionary definition of courage is “the quality of mind or spirit that enables a person to face difficulty, danger, pain, etc., without fear.” Courageous leaders lead with principles–their True North–that guide them when pressure mounts. They don’t shirk bold actions because they fear failure. They don’t need external adulation, nor do they shrink from facing criticism.</p><p>Courage is neither an intellectual quality, nor can it be taught in the classroom. It can only be gained through multiple experiences involving personal risk-taking. Courage comes from the heart. As Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh once said, “The longest journey you will ever take is the 18 inches from your head to your heart.”</p><p>It takes bold decisions to build great global companies. If businesses are managed without courageous leadership, then R&amp;D programs, product pipelines, investments in emerging markets, and employees’ commitment to the company’s mission all wither. These organizations can slip into malaise and may eventually fail, even if their leaders can move on to avoid being held accountable.</p><p>Why do some leaders lack courage? Many CEOs focus too much on managing to hit their numbers. They avoid making risky decisions that may make them look bad in the eyes of peers and external critics. Often, they eschew major decisions because they fear failure. I know, because it happened to me.</p><p>In my first year as CEO of Medtronic, I passed up the opportunity to buy a rapidly growing angioplasty company because it faced patent and pricing risks. While those risks proved valid, Boston Scientific bought the company instead, transforming both enterprises and creating a formidable competitor for Medtronic. I didn’t have the courage to accept short-term risk to create long-term gain. It took Medtronic two decades of expensive research and development programs and additional acquisitions to become the leader in this field.</p><p>Let’s look at some recent examples of courageous leaders whose actions transformed their companies:</p><p>Alan Mulally&nbsp;When Mulally arrived at Ford, he found a depleted organization losing $18 billion that year and unwilling to address its fundamental issues. To retool Ford’s entire product line and automate its factories, Mulally borrowed&nbsp;<a href=\"http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2012-13/review-letter-mulally.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$23.5 billion</a>, convincing the Ford family to pledge its stock and the famous Ford Blue Oval as collateral. His bold move paid off. Unlike its Detroit competitors, Ford avoided bankruptcy, regained market share, and returned to profitability.</p><a href=\"http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2012-13/review-letter-mulally.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">$23.5 billion</a><p>Mary Barra&nbsp;In contrast to Mulally, General Motors CEO Rick Wagoner and his predecessors refused to transform GM’s product line, even as the company’s North American market share slid from 50 percent in the 1970s to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2012-13/review-letter-mulally.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">18 percent</a>. When the automobile market collapsed in late 2008, Wagoner was forced to ask President George W. Bush to bail the company out. Even so, GM declared&nbsp;<a href=\"http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2012-13/review-letter-mulally.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bankruptcy</a>&nbsp;months later.</p><a href=\"http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2012-13/review-letter-mulally.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">18 percent</a><a href=\"http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2012-13/review-letter-mulally.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">bankruptcy</a><p>Mary Barra, GM’s CEO since 2014, demonstrates the difference courage can make. Immediately after her appointment, she testified before a hostile Senate investigating committee about deaths from failed ignition switches on Chevrolet Camaros. Rather than make excuses, Barra took responsibility for the problems and went further to attribute them to “GM’s cultural problems.” Three years later, she is well on her way to transforming GM’s moribund, finance-driven culture into a dynamic, accountable organization focused on building quality vehicles worldwide.</p><p>Paul Polman&nbsp;When Polman became Unilever’s CEO in early 2009, he immediately began transforming the company, declaring bold goals to double revenues and generate&nbsp;<a href=\"http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2012-13/review-letter-mulally.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">70 percent</a>&nbsp;from emerging markets. He aligned 175,000 employees around sustainability, publishing the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2012-13/review-letter-mulally.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unilever Sustainable Living Plan&nbsp;</a>with well-defined metrics the following year. Polman’s efforts in his first eight years returned 214 percent to Unilever shareholders. Nevertheless, Kraft Heinz, owned by Brazilian private equity firm 3G, made a hostile bid to acquire Unilever on February 17, 2017. Polman immediately wheeled into action, convincing KHC to drop its bid two days later. Then he announced&nbsp;<a href=\"http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2012-13/review-letter-mulally.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seven bold moves</a>&nbsp;to enhance shareholder value without compromising the company’s ambitious long-term plans.</p><a href=\"http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2012-13/review-letter-mulally.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">70 percent</a><a href=\"http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2012-13/review-letter-mulally.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Unilever Sustainable Living Plan&nbsp;</a><a href=\"http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2012-13/review-letter-mulally.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">seven bold moves</a><p>In comparison, Kraft CEO Irene Rosenfeld quickly capitulated when confronted by activist Nelson Peltz in 2012. He wanted to split Kraft’s global business by spinning off its North American grocery products unit, which Rosenfeld wound up leading as an international business renamed Mondelez. Without the ability to access global markets, the old Kraft went into a period of decline, making it vulnerable to 3G’s 2015 takeover; meanwhile, Mondelez is adrift with declining revenues and earnings.</p><p>Indra Nooyi: Named CEO of PepsiCo in 2006, Nooyi foresaw the coming shift among consumers, especially the millennial generation, to healthier foods and beverages. She immediately introduced PepsiCo’s strategy “Performance with Purpose,” that focuses on complementing the company’s core soft drink and snack business with healthy foods and beverages. In 2013, PepsiCo was challenged by activist Peltz to split the company, but Nooyi steadfastly refused. Instead, she restructured her leadership team to deliver strong near-term performance while continuing to invest in her transformation strategy.</p><p>Nooyi’s arch-rival, Coca-Cola CEO Muhtar Kent, decided instead to concentrate on sugar-based soft drinks while ignoring these obvious trends. As a result, Coca-Cola’s performance has consistently lagged PepsiCo’s. Since 2011, PepsiCo stock is up 70 percent, while Coca-Cola’s has increased only 15 percent.</p><p><strong>The courage cohort</strong></p><strong>The courage cohort</strong><p>There are literally thousands of competent managers who can run organizations efficiently using pre-determined operating plans, but few with the courage to transform entire enterprises.</p><p>The courage cohort includes Delta’s Richard Anderson, Starbucks’ Howard Schultz, Xerox’s Anne Mulcahy and Ursula Burns, Nestle’s Peter Brabeck-Letmathe, Novartis’ Dan Vasella, Tesla’s Elon Musk, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Merck’s Ken Frazier, and Alibaba’s Jack Ma. They join the growing list of authentic leaders that have made courageous decisions to build great global companies.</p><p>To quote poet Maya Angelou, “Courage is the most important of all the virtues, because without courage you can’t practice any other virtue consistently.” Boards of directors need to examine their leaders carefully to determine if they have the courage to navigate their organizations through turbulent times while enduring hardship, risk, and criticism to ensure they are building sustainable enterprises./p&gt;</p><p>With more courageous leaders like those cited above, the business world will be able to create enormous value for all its stakeholders.</p><p><em>Bill George&nbsp;is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of Discover Your True North.</em></p><em>Bill George&nbsp;is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of Discover Your True North.</em><p><em>This content was originally posted on<a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/courage-the-defining-characteristic-of-great-leaders\"> HBSWK.hbs.edu</a> on 4/24/17.</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on<a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/courage-the-defining-characteristic-of-great-leaders\"> HBSWK.hbs.edu</a> on 4/24/17.</em><a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/courage-the-defining-characteristic-of-great-leaders\"> HBSWK.hbs.edu</a><div></div>"

      "<p>Next Tuesday, April 25 is a fateful day for the board of directors of Wells Fargo.</p><p>That’s the date set for the company’s annual shareholder meeting in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida. Due to <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wells-fargo-iss-20170407-story.html\">recommendations</a> to vote against most of Wells’ board members by two shareholder advisory services – ISS and Glass Lewis – shareholders will have to decide whether to support the Wells Fargo board in its efforts to overcome fraudulent actions in its community banking division, or to reject their reelection.</p><a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-wells-fargo-iss-20170407-story.html\">recommendations</a><p>My recommendation is to reelect the Wells Fargo board members, trusting them to continue restoring the bank to its former position of integrity and commercial success. Here’s why:</p><p>Since the board became fully aware of what happened in Wells’ community banking division six months ago, it has stepped up to its responsibilities with a series of aggressive actions, both to punish the wrongdoers and to rebuild its culture with new leadership.</p><p>As a Wells Fargo customer since 1970, I was shocked by last fall’s revelations that 5,300 Wells employees had been terminated for establishing 2.1 million false accounts for unsuspecting customers. Until then, I viewed Wells Fargo as the role model commercial bank. Even more unsettling was the way former CEO John Stumpf blamed first-line employees for the problems, <a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/danpontefract/2016/09/15/wells-fargo-proves-corporate-culture-can-also-be-a-competitive-disadvantage/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=#de38ad032ff3\">saying</a>, “If they’re not going to do the thing that we ask them to do—put customers first, honor our vision and values—I don’t want them here.” Meanwhile, he continued to protect community banking head Carrie Tolstedt, <a href=\"https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/press/2016/tolstedt-to-retire_0712/\">praising her</a> as “a standard-bearer of our culture” and “a champion for our customers.” Blaming people making $12-14 per hour for such widespread fraud was preposterous. Meanwhile, Tolstedt walked away with a <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493791920/wells-fargo-units-leader-departs-with-125-million-after-group-incurs-record-fine\">$125 million</a> “retirement” payout.</p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=http://www.forbes.com/sites/danpontefract/2016/09/15/wells-fargo-proves-corporate-culture-can-also-be-a-competitive-disadvantage/&amp;refURL=&amp;referrer=#de38ad032ff3\">saying</a><a href=\"https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/press/2016/tolstedt-to-retire_0712/\">praising her</a><a href=\"http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2016/09/13/493791920/wells-fargo-units-leader-departs-with-125-million-after-group-incurs-record-fine\">$125 million</a><p><strong>The Board Wheels into Action</strong></p><strong>The Board Wheels into Action</strong><p>There was a public uproar when these misdeeds were announced, followed by Stumpf’s disastrous performance before the Senate Banking Committee. It was then that the Wells Fargo board realized Stumpf and Tolstedt had misled the board, so it belatedly wheeled into action. It terminated Stumpf immediately, <a href=\"https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/press/2016/ceo-john-stumpf-retires_1012/\">replacing him</a> with chief operating officer Tim Sloan and appointing Mary Mack as head of community banking. Later, it revoked Tolstedt’s retirement and terminated her for cause. In addition, it <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-10/wells-fargo-board-says-leaders-shrugged-off-scandal-then-hid-it\">“clawed back”</a> $41 million of Stumpf’s compensation, $19 million from Tolstedt, and $48 million from other senior executives – a total of $108 million.</p><a href=\"https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/press/2016/ceo-john-stumpf-retires_1012/\">replacing him</a><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-10/wells-fargo-board-says-leaders-shrugged-off-scandal-then-hid-it\">“clawed back”</a><p>But the board didn’t stop there. It amended its bylaws to require the <a href=\"https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/press/2016/separation-chairman-ceo-roles_1201/\">separation</a> of the roles of chairman and CEO. Former General Mills CEO Steven Sanger, who had been the board’s lead director, stepped up to the chair’s role and Elizabeth Duke, former member of the Federal Reserve Board, became vice chair. It also reorganized its risk and corporate responsibility committees.</p><a href=\"https://www.wellsfargo.com/about/press/2016/separation-chairman-ceo-roles_1201/\">separation</a><p>The Wells Fargo board then launched a major independent investigation of what had happened, appointing law firm Shearman &amp; Sterling to do the detailed work. The board’s <a href=\"https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/presentations/2017/board-report.pdf?https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/presentations/2017/board-report.pdf\">113-page report</a>, released in its entirety on April 10, 2017, was highly revealing. It pulled no punches in its extreme criticism of Stumpf, Tolstedt, and Wells’ community banking culture. Based on this report, the board extracted an additional $28 million from Stumpf’s compensation and $47 million from Tolstedt, bringing the total clawback to $183 million – the largest such action in U.S. banking history.</p><a href=\"https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/presentations/2017/board-report.pdf?https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/presentations/2017/board-report.pdf\">113-page report</a><p>The investigation singled out Tolstedt <a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/04/10/wells-fargo-carrie-tolstedt-clawback-net-worth-fortune-mpw/\">142 times</a> for creating the wrong culture in her unit and covering up its misdeeds. It noted she intentionally misled the Wells board as she <a href=\"https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/presentations/2017/board-report.pdf?https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/presentations/2017/board-report.pdf\">“minimized and understated problems,”</a> saying only 230 of her employees had been terminated when the regulatory settlement acknowledged the actual number was 5,300 employees. When Tolstedt began reporting to Sloan in late 2015, he wanted to terminate her, but Stumpf refused, saying she was <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-accounts-idUSKBN17C18P\">“the best banker in America.”</a> Lead director Sanger and other board members also pushed unsuccessfully for her removal at that time.</p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/04/10/wells-fargo-carrie-tolstedt-clawback-net-worth-fortune-mpw/\">142 times</a><a href=\"https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/presentations/2017/board-report.pdf?https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/presentations/2017/board-report.pdf\">“minimized and understated problems,”</a><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-wells-fargo-accounts-idUSKBN17C18P\">“the best banker in America.”</a><p>How could things have gone so awry at Wells Fargo with the controls placed on large banks by the Federal Reserve and other regulators? Stumpf seems to have disengaged from the day-to-day conduct of bank affairs. He clearly had a blind spot regarding Tolstedt, giving her far too much latitude in Wells’ decentralized structure. According to the board report, she ran her unit in an <a href=\"https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/presentations/2017/board-report.pdf?https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/presentations/2017/board-report.pdf\">“insular and defensive”</a> way, not letting corporate officials examine what was going on. As some former employees have alleged, Wells’ community banking had a <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-leadership-blind-spots-at-wells-fargo\">“soul-crushing”</a> culture of fear and daily intimidation. When alerted to the sales fraud, Stumpf refused to believe Tolstedt’s business model was seriously impaired and that the fraud could be systemic. He actively discouraged critical feedback from his subordinates, as he continued to tout Wells’ “culture of caring.”</p><a href=\"https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/presentations/2017/board-report.pdf?https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/presentations/2017/board-report.pdf\">“insular and defensive”</a><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-leadership-blind-spots-at-wells-fargo\">“soul-crushing”</a><p><strong>How Could the Board <em>Not</em> Know Wells Was So Far Off Track?</strong></p><strong>How Could the Board <em>Not</em> Know Wells Was So Far Off Track?</strong><em>Not</em><p>Given the extent of wrongdoing, how could the board not have seen what was going on? In retrospect, it is clear that both Stumpf and Tolstedt were actively misleading the board until the blowup occurred in 2016. As the board’s report <a href=\"https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/presentations/2017/board-report.pdf?https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/presentations/2017/board-report.pdf\">noted</a>, “the Board should have been more forceful in pushing Stumpf to change leadership.”</p><a href=\"https://www08.wellsfargomedia.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/presentations/2017/board-report.pdf?https://www.wellsfargo.com/assets/pdf/about/investor-relations/presentations/2017/board-report.pdf\">noted</a><p>However, I strongly disagree with ISS’s and Glass Lewis’s recommendations to get rid of the board members who are solving the problems, namely chairman Sanger and the bulk of the board. When there is blood in the water, count on these sharks to attack because they have nothing to lose. It is an easy shot for these two advisory firms – neither of which holds shares in Wells Fargo – to recommend against the board, but doing so would ignore and punish the board’s aggressive actions since the debacle became public.</p><p>While I am critical of Wells’ board for not acting earlier, it has taken more aggressive action than any commercial bank to correct its problems – actions for which it should be applauded, not attacked. Having served on 10 corporate boards including Goldman Sachs, I know just how difficult it is to know what is going on in the trenches. Board members are dependent on the veracity and transparency of their chief executives and their subordinates. In the Wells Fargo case, they were sorely misled.</p><p>Many other boards would have “circled the wagons” and used lawyers to protect and defend themselves. Not the Wells board. That is thanks to the leadership of chairman Sanger and CEO Sloan, who showed their confidence in Wells Fargo by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-17/wells-fargo-ceo-chairman-buy-5-million-of-stock-after-review\">purchasing $3 million and $2 million</a>, respectively, of Wells Fargo stock last week. They are moving as aggressively as they can to solve the cultural problems in community banking with an entirely new management team, revised sales incentives, and centralized risk processes. While this is a work-in-progress – organizations with 268,000 employees don’t turn around overnight – their intentions are clear and their progress in the last six months is very noteworthy.</p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-17/wells-fargo-ceo-chairman-buy-5-million-of-stock-after-review\">purchasing $3 million and $2 million</a><p>For these reasons, I recommend that Wells’ shareholders give its board members a vote of confidence next Tuesday by reelecting all of them.</p><p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of Discover Your True North.

    "post_date": "March 31, 2017",
    "post_content": [
      "<p>There is a stark lesson to be learned from last week’s dramatic collapse of the American Health Care Act, as created by House Speaker Paul Ryan and backed by President Trump. To make massive changes in a democratic society, you need a bipartisan approach that benefits the vast majority of Americans, not the kind of ideological scheme created by Ryan and his Republican colleagues.</p><p>In retrospect, it was surprising that an astute politician like Trump threw his full weight behind a health care plan that took insurance away from 24 million people while cutting taxes for wealthy Americans, pharmaceutical companies and health plans by $885 billion. Trump dodged a bullet when support for the bill collapsed among Republicans, as it would have done great harm to the working class – the majority of them Trump voters, angry about disparities between the rich and the poor.</p><p>Next on their agenda, Trump and Ryan are planning to tackle tax reform. If Trump thought health care was complicated, wait until he digs into the complexities of the U.S. tax code, and has to deal with myriad lobbyists who jealously guard tax breaks on behalf of their sponsors.</p><p>It is time for President Trump to adopt an entirely different approach:</p><p>Giving the lead on tax reform to Ryan – who has yet to demonstrate he can deliver his Republican caucus – would be a monumental error, compounding the problems encountered on health care reform. Ryan and House Ways and Means Chair Kevin Brady are advocating a “border adjustment tax” (affectionately called BAT) of 20% on all goods coming into the U.S. They hope to raise $1 trillion to pay for tax cuts to benefit the wealthy and to persuade manufacturers to relocate to the U.S.</p><p>There are three fundamental problems with their approach:</p><p>Retailers like Walmart, Target and Best Buy import over 90% of their merchandise from outside the U.S., so they will be forced to raise their prices to consumers by 20%. These price increases will fall most heavily on people who can least afford them – the working class, discount store shoppers that voted for Trump. In addition, the retail industry employs 42 million people directly and indirectly, far more than the entire manufacturing sector. (Ref: https://nrf.com/advocacy/retails-impact) If the BAT is enacted, many retail employees will lose their jobs as retail profits are squeezed.</p><p>First, in response to the BAT, it is likely that China, Mexico and European nations will retaliate with 20% tariffs of their own. These will hit American exporters the hardest, especially high tech producers like General Electric, Boeing, Pfizer and Caterpillar that sell their goods to the Chinese. Rather than helping U.S. employment, they may be forced to shift production overseas to avoid the punitive tariffs. In addition, farmers will be hard hit as they export one-third of their crops – over $130 billion each year – to Mexico and Canada.</p><p>Secondly, it is a myth to think that the BAT will stimulate U.S. production in any meaningful way. Textile and apparel manufacturers are not coming back to the U.S. Nor are television set makers. Those industries were lost 30 years ago.</p><p>Take the auto industry for example. Today General Motors sells more automobiles in China than it does in the U.S., and its component parts are made all over the world. In competing with local Chinese manufacturers, GM can ill afford the higher costs and tariffs associated with U.S. exports if the BAT is enacted.</p><p>The long-term implications of Ryan and Trump’s strategy are even more severe. Since the end of World War II, the U.S. has had a bipartisan commitment to reach trade agreements with developed and developing nations to reduce tariffs to the benefit of U.S. consumers and exporters. If America abandons its commitments to free trade by attempting to renegotiate long-standing agreements, the world could devolve into a 1930s-style trade war that will harm everyone. President Trump may find the Chinese are a lot harder to negotiate with than the recalcitrant Republicans in the Freedom Caucus that doomed the health care bill.</p><p>There is a better way to go: Trump should give the assignment to pragmatic, non-ideological advisors like Gary Cohn, head of the National Economic Council, and Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, and their staffs and let them devise a sound plan that addresses the most severe problems in the U.S. tax code. Given its complexities, they should focus on a few key proposals for which they can gain a bipartisan consensus, rather than trying to revamp the entire tax code – which they will find is an extraordinarily difficult task and virtually impossible to build a bipartisan consensus.</p><p>On the top of their list should be some of the following proposals for which there could be support on both sides of the aisle:</p><ul>\n<li>Repatriation of cash held overseas by corporations with a one-year tax holiday if companies get a plan approved by the Treasury department to invest repatriated funds in the U.S. to expand U.S. manufacturing, research and development and workforce training.</li>\n<li>Reducing the corporate tax rate from its present 35% – the highest in the developed world – to a more competitive 25% in exchange for eliminating many of the corporate loopholes that enable many companies to pay minimal taxes or none at all.</li>\n<li>Reducing taxes on individuals earning less than $50,000 per year while paying for the reduction by cutting back on deductions like interest on mortgages above $250,000, state tax credits, etc.</li>\n<li>Providing workforce training tax credits to both individuals and companies to ensure that America has a more competitive workforce that is skilled in computerized, automated tasks.</li>\n<li>Reducing regulations on high-tech manufacturers and large exporters to make U.S.-based companies more competitive globally.</li>\n</ul><li>Repatriation of cash held overseas by corporations with a one-year tax holiday if companies get a plan approved by the Treasury department to invest repatriated funds in the U.S. to expand U.S. manufacturing, research and development and workforce training.</li><li>Reducing the corporate tax rate from its present 35% – the highest in the developed world – to a more competitive 25% in exchange for eliminating many of the corporate loopholes that enable many companies to pay minimal taxes or none at all.</li><li>Reducing taxes on individuals earning less than $50,000 per year while paying for the reduction by cutting back on deductions like interest on mortgages above $250,000, state tax credits, etc.</li><li>Providing workforce training tax credits to both individuals and companies to ensure that America has a more competitive workforce that is skilled in computerized, automated tasks.</li><li>Reducing regulations on high-tech manufacturers and large exporters to make U.S.-based companies more competitive globally.</li><p>Even with these modest proposals, Trump will have to learn how to work with moderate Democrats in both the House and the Senate in order to gain backing for his legislation. In so doing, he will lose some of the extremists in his own party, but so be it. In the U.S. two-party system, compromise generally produces better outcomes than one-party legislation. Trump will also be forced to fend off the lobbyists – thus fulfilling his campaign promise to “drain the swamp” – in order to gain approval for his legislation. For example, will he and ex-real estate executive Mnuchin be willing to ignore the lobbyists from their former real estate industry to pass a tax bill for the good of the American people?</p><p>In spite of its obvious perils, tax reform presents President Trump the opportunity to fulfill his campaign promises to strengthen America’s economy, create jobs, and expand our leadership of the most important industries for the future.</p><p>It will make America even greater.</p><p><em>Bill George is senior fellow at Harvard Business School and former chair and CEO of Medtronic.

On one side Unilever CEO Paul Polman champions sustainable growth in earnings to raise long-term shareholder value. On the other side KHC and its Brazilian owner 3G advocate maximizing short-term earnings to increase near-term valuation.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/KHC\" target=\"_self\">Kraft Heinz</a><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/UNA-NL\" target=\"_self\">Unilever</a><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Long-term investors’ perspective</span></p><span>Long-term investors’ perspective</span><p>CEOs of companies aiming for sustainable growth in shareholder value know they must achieve short-term results while they continue to invest in R&amp;D, capital expenditures, global expansion, and people development to sustain their growth. During economic downturns, this can be a difficult balancing act, but nothing less is required.</p><p>These long-term value creators use compound growth in revenues, earnings per share, and return on capital invested as measures of longer-term performance. The great value creators of recent decades like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/BRK.A\" target=\"_self\">Berkshire Hathaway</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/JNJ\" target=\"_self\">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/DIS\" target=\"_self\">Disney</a>&nbsp;have mastered the ability to achieve these long-term metrics as well as their near-term goals, thereby sustaining growth in shareholder value.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/BRK.A\" target=\"_self\">Berkshire Hathaway</a><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/JNJ\" target=\"_self\">Johnson &amp; Johnson</a><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/DIS\" target=\"_self\">Disney</a><p>But this doesn’t protect them from activist investors seeking immediate returns.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Traders’ perspective</span></p><span>Traders’ perspective</span><p>Traders seek immediate gains in stock values to demonstrate above market returns to their investors, with little regard to the long-term future of the companies.</p><p>In recent years, fund managers have shifted their focus to cash flow available for shareholder distribution, either through dividends or repurchase of shares, with growing pressure on companies to increase share buybacks. However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2016/02/24/how-stock-buybacks-destroy-shareholder-value/#3b013ba57841\" target=\"_self\">there is scant evidence</a>&nbsp;that buybacks produce sustainable increases in shareholder value.</p><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2016/02/24/how-stock-buybacks-destroy-shareholder-value/#3b013ba57841\" target=\"_self\">there is scant evidence</a><p>Corporate leaders are thus faced with ongoing tradeoffs between using their cash flow for internal expansion and acquisitions versus increasing dividends and buybacks</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Latest battle: Anglo-Dutch Unilever versus Brazilian 3G</span></p><span>Latest battle: Anglo-Dutch Unilever versus Brazilian 3G</span><p>Last month’s proposed takeover of London-based Unilever by Brazilian private equity firm 3G provided a real-time example of how these conflicting objectives collide.</p><p>Unilever’s roots date to 1872 with the founding of Margarine Unie and 1885 founding of Lever Brothers. Their 1930 merger as Unilever created the first modern multi-national company with equal roots in Britain and the Netherlands. When Dutchman Paul Polman took the helm in early 2009, he declared bold goals to double Unilever’s size from 40 billion Euros to 80 billion by 2020, and generate 70 percent of revenues from emerging markets.</p><p>“The larger issue at stake here is not just the fate of a single company, but the fate of capitalism itself.”</p><p>Polman has transformed Unilever into a growth-oriented global competitor that has more deeply penetrated emerging markets than any other consumer products company. To date, Unilever has made significant progress toward Polman’s goals, with 2016 revenues of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/about/who-we-are/about-Unilever/\" target=\"_self\">53 billion Euros</a>, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/about/who-we-are/about-Unilever/\" target=\"_self\">57 percent from emerging markets</a>. He takes justifiable pride that Unilever has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/investor-relations/dividends/dividend-history-and-reinvestment/nv-share-dividend-history/\" target=\"_self\">increased its dividends 8 percent</a>&nbsp;per annum for the past 36 years. Polman has used “sustainability” as the company’s unifying force, introducing the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/\" target=\"_self\">Unilever Sustainable Living Plan</a>&nbsp;in 2010 with dozens of metrics to measure progress. For his advocacy of environmental sustainability, Polman received the UN’s<a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/news/news-and-features/2015/Paul-Polman-receives-UNs-highest-environmental-accolade.html\" target=\"_self\">&nbsp;“Champion of the Earth Award.”</a></p><a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/about/who-we-are/about-Unilever/\" target=\"_self\">53 billion Euros</a><a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/about/who-we-are/about-Unilever/\" target=\"_self\">57 percent from emerging markets</a><a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/investor-relations/dividends/dividend-history-and-reinvestment/nv-share-dividend-history/\" target=\"_self\">increased its dividends 8 percent</a><a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/sustainable-living/\" target=\"_self\">Unilever Sustainable Living Plan</a><a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/news/news-and-features/2015/Paul-Polman-receives-UNs-highest-environmental-accolade.html\" target=\"_self\">&nbsp;“Champion of the Earth Award.”</a><p>Yet, some investors worry that Polman’s commitment of Unilever resources to sustainability is detracting from its financial performance.</p><p>Unilever’s track record attests to Polman’s success: in his eight years as CEO, Unilever’s revenues have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.unilever.com/investor-relations/results-and-publications/quarterly-results/\" target=\"_self\">grown 32 percent, averaging 3.8 percent the past four years</a>, making it one of the top performers in consumer products.

With its aggressive, “take no prisoners” style, 3G uses the cash it generates to pay down debt and buy additional companies. 3G has successfully applied this formula to the retail, beer and fast food industries.</p><p>In 2013 3G saw the opportunity to shake up old-line food companies whose iconic products were out of favor with Millennials. It purchased Pittsburg-based Heinz with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway as co-investor, and immediately applied its cost-cutting formula. Initial success led 3G to buy a failing Kraft Foods in 2015 and merge it with Heinz as Kraft Heinz (KHC).</p><p>Since then, revenues have fallen by 4-5 percent per year, raising questions about whether KHC can sustainably grow earnings without further investment or acquisitions. Most security analysts predicted 3G would tack on additional acquisitions, with food company targets like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/MDLZ\" target=\"_self\">Mondelez</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/CPB\" target=\"_self\">Campbell Soup</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/GIS\" target=\"_self\">General Mills</a>. Few suspected KHC would attempt to take over a top performer like Unilever, whose business is 60 percent personal care and home care.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/MDLZ\" target=\"_self\">Mondelez</a><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/CPB\" target=\"_self\">Campbell Soup</a><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/GIS\" target=\"_self\">General Mills</a><p>KHC launched its attack by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/article/4047349-unilever-rejects-kraft-heinzs-initial-bid\" target=\"_self\">offering $50 per share</a>, 18 percent above Unilever’s stock price. This was equivalent to its price last fall before it fell in sync with the weakening Euro, making KHC’s low-ball offer easy for Unilever’s board to reject. According to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/02/19/kraft-heinz-abandons-115bn-unilever-mega-deal/\" target=\"_self\">British press reports</a>, KHC’s executives were taken aback by the ferocity of CEO Paul Polman’s rebuff, along with its cold reception from the British government.</p><a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/article/4047349-unilever-rejects-kraft-heinzs-initial-bid\" target=\"_self\">offering $50 per share</a><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/02/19/kraft-heinz-abandons-115bn-unilever-mega-deal/\" target=\"_self\">British press reports</a><p>“Those of us who believe capitalism is a great long-term value creator must care about the fate of great companies that are role models for the way capitalism should work.”</p><p>Consequently, KHC withdrew its offer just 50 hours after the takeover was launched. Many suspect that Buffett, who has always opposed hostile offers, told Lehman he wasn’t willing to fund a war between Unilever and 3G. Although the war ended as quickly as it began, it sent shock waves through Unilever’s organization and the British investing community.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">. . . and Unilever responds</span></p><span>. . . and Unilever responds</span><p>In response, Unilever’s leaders mobilized, recognizing KHC’s offer was “a shot across the bow,” and the battle is far from over. Immediately following KHC’s withdrawal, Polman met with his board and announced that&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/02/22/unilever-jolted-action-kraft-heinzs-bazooka/\" target=\"_self\">Unilever will undergo a complete assessment</a>&nbsp;by April of its product portfolio, cost structure and balance sheet in order to enhance near-term shareholder returns.</p><a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2017/02/22/unilever-jolted-action-kraft-heinzs-bazooka/\" target=\"_self\">Unilever will undergo a complete assessment</a><p>It is likely that Unilever will consider leveraging up its balance sheet and announcing stock buybacks rather than letting an aggressor buy the company using its own balance sheet. More cost reductions may be in order going forward if the softness in the consumer packaged goods market continues. Also on the docket is the analysis of Unilever’s vast product portfolio, which may trigger the sale of declining brands and categories, or even breaking the company in two by spinning off its foods business.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Reflections on this battle</span></p><span>Reflections on this battle</span><p>Nevertheless, the question remains: why did 3G choose to attack 145-year old Unilever, a top performing company with aggressive leaders that are creating great value for shareholders as well as customers, employees and society at large through sustainability initiatives?</p><p>3G’s attack on Unilever raises important concerns about these competing models of capitalism. Those of us who believe capitalism is a great long-term value creator must care about the fate of great companies that are role models for the way capitalism should work.</p><p>Sustainable enterprises that prosper for many decades – General Electric, Procter &amp; Gamble, IBM, Ford, and Exxon, just to name a few – have created enormous value for everyone involved, from employees to shareholders. If a top performer like Unilever can be attacked, then no company is safe from hostile takeover.</p><p>The larger issue at stake here is not just the fate of a single company, but the fate of capitalism itself. In a world increasingly concerned with disparities between the haves and have-nots, the voters that chose Brexit and elected President Trump are expressing deep feelings of powerlessness in a world dominated by wealthy elites. Unconstrained capitalism focusing strictly on short-term gains can cause great harm to employees, communities and the greater needs of society. In this case capitalism will face the wrath of democratic nations as their citizens demand significant constraints on all companies that limit their freedom to operate.</p><p>If this happens, we will all be worse off.</p><p><em>Commentary by Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and the author of “Discover Your True North.” Follow him on Twitter&nbsp;<a title=\"www.twitter.com/Bill_George\" href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Bill_George\" target=\"_self\">@Bill_George</a>.</em></p><em>Commentary by Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and the author of “Discover Your True North.” Follow him on Twitter&nbsp;<a title=\"www.twitter.com/Bill_George\" href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Bill_George\" target=\"_self\">@Bill_George</a>.</em><a title=\"www.twitter.com/Bill_George\" href=\"http://www.twitter.com/Bill_George\" target=\"_self\">@Bill_George</a><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/24/kraft-heinz-unilever-battle-threat-to-capitalism-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a> on 3/24/17.</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/24/kraft-heinz-unilever-battle-threat-to-capitalism-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a> on 3/24/17.</em><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/24/kraft-heinz-unilever-battle-threat-to-capitalism-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a><div></div>"

      "<p>President&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\" target=\"_self\">Donald Trump</a>‘s actions are sending shock waves through the business community, but will CEOs have the courage to challenge him?</p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\" target=\"_self\">Donald Trump</a><p>Publicly, most CEOs are declaring how pleased they are with the President’s attention, which has been greater in the past three months from President Trump than it was in eight years under President Obama. Trump is promising them lower corporate taxes, fewer regulations on financial services, health care and energy, and improved infrastructure, while acknowledging business as the driver of economic growth. Every week the President is meeting with CEOs from major industries. Last week it was retailers; before that, airlines and automobiles.</p><p>Beneath these rosy promises, Trump’s policies are setting off alarm bells in C-suites. Even before his inauguration, he shook business leaders with a series of tweets attacking such great American stalwarts as Ford, General Motors, Boeing, Lockheed Martin, and United Technologies, criticizing their global manufacturing plans, while threatening them with large tariffs for imported products.</p><p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/F\" target=\"_self\">Ford</a>&nbsp;and United Technologies’ Carrier division immediately offered compromises to avoid Trump’s wrath. Concerned their companies might be the next recipient of a Trump tweet, the CEOs of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN\" target=\"_self\">Amazon</a>, Fiat/Chrysler, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/S\" target=\"_self\">Sprint</a>&nbsp;rushed to Trump Tower with offers to employ more Americans. In reality, they were just re-announcing previously published expansion plans. CEO Brian Krzanich told the President that Intel was restarting a $7 billion facility in Arizona, which was originally launched in 2011 under President Obama, and then postponed in 2014 due to lack of demand.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/F\" target=\"_self\">Ford</a><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN\" target=\"_self\">Amazon</a><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/S\" target=\"_self\">Sprint</a><p>In a recent interview with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/02/business-leaders-should-stand-up-to-president-trump\" target=\"_self\">Harvard Business Review</a>, former U.S. treasury secretary Larry Summers called on business leaders to stand up to the Trump administration, asking, “If CEOs who employ hundreds of thousands of people are not in a position to speak truth to power, who is going to do so?” Rather than trying to curry favor with President Trump, business leaders need to advocate for their long-term needs, and challenge him when his actions will harm their long-term futures.</p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2017/02/business-leaders-should-stand-up-to-president-trump\" target=\"_self\">Harvard Business Review</a><p>Since his January 20th inauguration, President Trump has signed more than 20 executive actions on issues including jobs, trade, immigration, national security, health care, and financial regulations. Most controversial to date was the 120-day travel ban, a move the State of Washington challenged as unconstitutional. The Washington court temporarily lifted the ban, which the Trump administration challenged in the Court of Appeals.</p><p>This represented a seminal challenge to technology companies that rely heavily on immigrants. With more than 5.5 million jobs going unfilled for lack of qualified applicants, they cannot afford to hire only American-born citizens. Thus, 97 technology companies including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL\" target=\"_self\">Apple</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL\" target=\"_self\">Google</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/FB\" target=\"_self\">Facebook</a>, Microsoft, eBay, and Intel, stepped up by taking the unprecedented step of filing a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3454225/Amicus-Brief-by-Tech-Companies.pdf\" target=\"_self\">joint amicus brief</a>&nbsp;challenging the order, claiming it “threatens companies’ ability to attract talent, business, and investment to the United States.” They were joined by Coca-Cola, General Electric, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Starbucks – more than 140 companies in all – marking the first time CEOs had actively challenged Trump. On February 8, the President had his most significant defeat when the Court of Appeals refused to reinstate the travel ban.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL\" target=\"_self\">Apple</a><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/GOOGL\" target=\"_self\">Google</a><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/FB\" target=\"_self\">Facebook</a><a href=\"https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3454225/Amicus-Brief-by-Tech-Companies.pdf\" target=\"_self\">joint amicus brief</a><p>In addition to the travel ban, Trump’s actions are shaking up leaders in other sectors. His proposed border adjustment tax on imports would adversely impact major apparel and electronics retailers like Walmart, Target, Best Buy, Nike, and Under Armour that rely on overseas production. A 20 percent border tax would lead to a 20 percent price increase for consumers, creating more strain on their wallets and threatening the jobs of 15 million retail employees. Trump’s egregious tweet against Nordstrom accused the company of treating his daughter Ivanka unfairly for discontinuing her branded products.</p><p>Nordstrom defended its decision, citing declining sales of Ivanka’s products.</p><p>Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank tried to curry Trump’s favor,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/07/under-armour-ceo-to-wall-street-critics-they-bet-against-tom-brady-too.html\" target=\"_self\">calling him</a>&nbsp;“a great asset to America.” He was forced to recant when Steph Curry, his firm’s top sponsored athlete, responded he would agree if Plank removed the letters “et” from his praise. Plank acknowledged the border tax would hurt his firm’s sales since “there are no apparel makers or textile companies left in America.”</p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/02/07/under-armour-ceo-to-wall-street-critics-they-bet-against-tom-brady-too.html\" target=\"_self\">calling him</a><p>Trump’s numerous executive orders are easy to issue but often vague or unclear about details, making their implementation complex and confusing. As Trump tries to repeal Obamacare, he is learning how hard it is to design a reasonable replacement. The same is true for reducing financial regulations by gutting the 2010 Dodd-Frank bill, since no one wants to risk a 2008-style collapse.</p><p>Given the chaos in Washington, how should business executives lead in the Trump era? Will they have the courage to step up to these new challenges? My advice is to stay focused on their business, while not letting the president’s machinations throw them off course and speaking out whenever required.</p><p>Here are five recommendations for business leaders:</p><ol>\n<li>Focus on True North.&nbsp;Stay focused on realizing your mission despite the uncertainty. Do not deviate from the core principles that define your company for fear of retaliation from the Trump administration. Staying on track will deepen the loyalty of customers and employees – the people who matter most.</li>\n<li>Build on your strengths.&nbsp;Develop a clear vision of how your company will win by strengthening unique differentiators setting you apart from competitors, and leveraging these strengths to gain competitive advantage.</li>\n<li>Adapt your tactics, not your strategy.&nbsp;Continue with strategies established before Trump took office, but rapidly adapt tactics to this era of extreme volatility. Encourage employees to stay agile and think creatively about different ways of achieving their goals, despite roadblocks they face. You may be forced to make tactical adjustments, but pursue your strategy with laser-like focus.</li>\n<li>Don’t abandon globalization.&nbsp;Globalization is a reality that will continue despite the administration’s recent efforts to halt it. An “America First” mentality limits your growth potential, so continue to build your global business without backing away from expanding overseas. Embrace globalization by targeting new foreign markets, hiring diverse employees, and building overseas operations. At Medtronic we hired three Americans for every job created overseas as the company expanded from 4,000 employees in 1989 to 85,000 today.</li>\n<li>Prepare for the jobs of the future.&nbsp;Speak out publicly to encourage Trump to address the real jobs issue: the skills gap created by the lack of lifelong training and education. Prepare your workforce for jobs of the future instead of protecting antiquated jobs as Carrier agreed to do. Take a cue from Amazon, General Electric, and SAS, whose programs enable employees to develop skills required for tomorrow’s world.</li>\n</ol><li>Focus on True North.&nbsp;Stay focused on realizing your mission despite the uncertainty.

      "<p>With the events of 2016—Brexit, the election of Donald Trump, threats from terrorists and cybercriminals, climate change—business leaders have entered a new era requiring new ways of leading. Traditional management methods seem no longer sufficient to address the volume of change we are seeing. I label this VUCA 2.0.</p><p>In a 1998&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a345812.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a>&nbsp;designed to train officers for the twenty-first century, the United States War College presaged a world that is “volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous” —VUCA, for short. VUCA describes perfectly what is happening in the global business world today.</p><a href=\"http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a345812.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">report</a><p>Business is not running as usual. Leaders must deal with growing uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity in their decision-making environments. CEOs have little idea what to expect in terms of health care policy, financial transactions, national security, and global trade—all of vital importance to themselves, their employees, and their stakeholders.</p><p>Managerial training in the classic techniques of control systems, financial forecasting, strategic planning, and statistical decision making have not prepared them for this amount of flux in the environment.</p><p>In short, these rapid-fire changes are putting extreme pressure on business leaders to lead in ways not heretofore seen.</p><h3><strong>The VUCA manager</strong></h3><strong>The VUCA manager</strong><p>Now is the time for authentic business leaders to step forward and lead in ways that business schools don’t teach. Let’s examine these different ways of leading comprising VUCA 2.0:</p><p><strong>Vision</strong>&nbsp;– Today’s business leaders need the ability to see through the chaos to have a clear vision for their organizations. They must define the True North of their organization: its mission, values, and strategy. They should create clarity around this True North and refuse to let external events pull them off course or cause them to neglect or abandon their mission, which must be their guiding light. CEO Paul Polman has done this especially well by focusing Unilever’s True North on sustainability.</p><strong>Vision</strong><p><strong>Understanding</strong>&nbsp;– With their vision in hand, leaders need in-depth understanding of their organization’s capabilities and strategies to take advantage of rapidly changing circumstances by playing to their strengths while minimizing their weaknesses. Listening only to information sources and opinions that reinforce their own views carries great risk of missing alternate points of view. Instead, leaders need to tap into myriad sources covering the full spectrum of viewpoints by engaging directly with their customers and employees to ensure they are attuned to changes in their markets. Spending time in the marketplace, retail stores, factories, innovation centers, and research labs, or just wandering around offices talking to people is essential.</p><strong>Understanding</strong><p><strong>Courage</strong>&nbsp;– Now more than ever, leaders need the courage to step up to these challenges and make audacious decisions that embody risks and often go against the grain. They cannot afford to keep their heads down, using traditional management techniques while avoiding criticism and risk-taking. In fact, their greatest risk lies in not having the courage to make bold moves. This era belongs to the bold, not the meek and timid.</p><strong>Courage</strong><p><strong>Adaptability</strong>&nbsp;– If ever there were a need for leaders to be flexible in adapting to this rapidly changing environment, this is it. Long-range plans are often obsolete by the time they are approved. Instead, flexible tactics are required for rapid adaptation to changing external circumstances, without altering strategic course. This is not a time for continuing the financial engineering so prevalent in the past decade. Rather, leaders need multiple contingency plans while preserving strong balance sheets to cope with unforeseen events.</p><strong>Adaptability</strong><p>With external volatility the prevalent characteristic these days, business leaders who stay focused on their mission and values and have the courage to deploy bold strategies building on their strengths will be the winners. Those who abandon core values or lock themselves into fixed positions and fail to adapt will wind up the losers.</p><p>Bill George is senior fellow at Harvard Business School, former chair and CEO of Medtronic, and author of&nbsp;Discover Your True North.</p><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/a-strategy-for-steady-leadership-in-an-unsteady-world\">HBS.edu</a> on 2/14/17.&nbsp;</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/a-strategy-for-steady-leadership-in-an-unsteady-world\">HBS.edu</a> on 2/14/17.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/a-strategy-for-steady-leadership-in-an-unsteady-world\">HBS.edu</a><div></div>"

      "<p>The world upside down this past week.</p><p>The first Chinese president ever to attend the World Economic Forum at Davos, Xi Jinping, opened the annual gathering last Monday morning with a full-throated endorsement of globalization, free trade, and cooperation between nations. “It is true that economic globalization created new problems,” he said, “but this is no justification to write off economic globalization altogether. Rather we should adapt to and guide economic globalization, cushion its negative impacts and deliver its benefits for all countries. Blaming economic globalization for the world’s problems is inconsistent with reality, and it will not help solve the problems.”</p><p>Xi<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/11/chinas-xi-to-promote-globalization-at-davos-not-war-and-poverty.html\"> warned that populist approaches can lead to war and poverty</a>. “No one would emerge as a winner in a global trade war,” he said. “Pursuing protectionism is just like locking one’s self in a dark room. Wind and rain might be kept outside but so are light and air.”</p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2017/01/11/chinas-xi-to-promote-globalization-at-davos-not-war-and-poverty.html\"> warned that populist approaches can lead to war and poverty</a><p>Meanwhile, President Donald Trump took precisely the opposite tack in his inaugural address on Friday. “From this day forward, it’s going to be only America first, America first. Every decision on trade, taxes, immigration, and foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families,” he announced. “We will bring back our jobs by following two simple rules: we will buy American and hire American.”</p><p>In just a week, the United States and China reversed the posture they each held for the past 70 years. While other nations have long looked to America for global leadership, the new President has made clear he will pursue a level of isolationism not seen since Col. Charles Lindberg and the America First Committee of 1940-1941.</p><p>As America withdraws from its global leadership role, China is stepping up as the new leader of world economic order, albeit one where it writes the rules to its own benefit. One of President Trump’s first orders was to formally withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which in turn will force Asian nations to negotiate bi-lateral agreements with China.</p><p>The consequences of these sudden changes could be profound and far-reaching with uncertain outcomes. Meanwhile, business leaders are scrambling to adapt to these sudden changes in the global order. At Davos, I had the opportunity to meet with many CEOs from the U.S., Europe and Asia to discuss how they plan to operate in this new environment.</p><p>The classic managerial techniques of strategic planning, accounting and control, management systems, and decision-making rely upon a predictable environment. While these disciplines will continue to be important, they are insufficient in this new world.</p><p>The U.S. Military Academy predicted much of this turmoil in a 2000 study.&nbsp; Its scenario for 21<sup>st</sup> century military leaders presaged a world that is “volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous” – VUCA, for short. These four words seem to describe perfectly what is happening in the global business world today.</p><sup>st</sup><p>In this VUCA world, I propose a different acronym for how leaders respond:</p><ul>\n<li><u>Visionary </u>– See through the chaos to envision where trends will lead. Stay focused on your organization’s strategy, its purpose and values. Do not let external events pull you off course, or cause you to neglect or abandon your mission. Communicate the importance of your mission and values as your organization’s guiding light.</li>\n<li><u>Understanding</u> – Comprehend how to take advantage of rapidly changing circumstances by playing to your company’s strengths while minimizing its weaknesses. Don’t limit your information sources to views that reinforce your own, as this carries great risks of missing alternate points of view. Tap into myriad sources for relevant information that covers the full spectrum of viewpoints.</li>\n<li><u>Clarity</u> – Integrate the disparate data of complex situations to see what lies ahead. Build mental models of the reality you face, and take advantages of opportunities to succeed in spite of the chaos.</li>\n<li><u>Adaptable</u> – Prepare to adapt your tactics to changing external circumstances, without altering your strategic course. Develop contingency plans and preserve balance sheet strength in order to cope with unforeseen events.</li>\n</ul><li><u>Visionary </u>– See through the chaos to envision where trends will lead. Stay focused on your organization’s strategy, its purpose and values. Do not let external events pull you off course, or cause you to neglect or abandon your mission.

Develop contingency plans and preserve balance sheet strength in order to cope with unforeseen events.</li><u>Adaptable</u><p>Of all these qualities, the last is most important. No longer can leaders adopt a fixed strategy and hold to it. Instead, they need openness to amending their tactics while pursuing their original vision. Leaders must become world-class learners by engaging directly with their employees and their customers, listening closely to them to ensure they are attuned to changes in their markets.</p><p>Many companies face trouble today because their leaders were late in understanding the reality of the changing environment. Former Wells Fargo CEO John Stumpf failed to engage with employees to understand the extreme impact of company sales incentives. After years of missing reality, legal action and media attention forced Stumpf to step down. Stumpf himself missed what others could see clearly: his employees were systematically opening false bank accounts to satisfy management goals.</p><p>Spending time in the marketplace, retail stores, factories, innovation centers, and research labs, or just wandering around offices talking to people spontaneously is a far better use of time than going to conferences or spending long hours with politicians, thinking you can change the course of events – except in specific cases where you can influence specific new laws or provisions that are vital to your company’s future.</p><p>With uncertainty the prevalent characteristic these days, business leaders that stay focused on their mission and values, and strategies that build on their strengths will emerge even stronger. Those that abandon core values or lock themselves into fixed positions and fail to adapt will wind up the losers.</p><p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of </em>Discover Your True North.</p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of </em><div></div>"

      "<p>If the Roman emperors ruled by edict, President-elect Donald Trump appears poised to rule by tweet. Even before taking office, Trump has discovered he can move the world’s largest global corporations with simple, 140-character tweets. And though his aggressive approach is winning politically, good politics doesn’t necessarily mean good economics.</p><p>Voters see Trump fulfilling his campaign promises to close America’s borders and bring jobs back home. He is using the bully pulpit to stand up for workers by taking on the most powerful American companies, including Ford&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/f\">(F, -0.24%)</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/general-motors-8/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">General Motors</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/gm\">(GM, -0.88%)</a>, Toyota&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/tm\">(TM, -0.03%)</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/boeing-24/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Boeing</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/ba\">(BA, +0.20%)</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/lockheed-martin-60/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lockheed Martin</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/lmt\">(LMT, +0.89%)</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/united-technologies-45/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United Technologies</a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/utx\">(UTX, -0.61%)</a>/Carrier.</p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/f\">(F, -0.24%)</a><a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/general-motors-8/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">General Motors</a><a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/gm\">(GM, -0.88%)</a><a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/tm\">(TM, -0.03%)</a><a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/boeing-24/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Boeing</a><a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/ba\">(BA, +0.20%)</a><a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/lockheed-martin-60/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lockheed Martin</a><a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/lmt\">(LMT, +0.89%)</a><a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/united-technologies-45/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">United Technologies</a><a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/utx\">(UTX, -0.61%)</a><p>Thus far, no CEOs have had the courage to stand up to Trump. General Motors CEO&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/01/09/donald-trump-general-motors-mary-barra/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mary Barra</a>&nbsp;has said the company’s small-car production will remain in Mexico, but it could only be a matter of time before she’s forced to change course. Trump’s sudden tweets likely worry many CEOs who fear they may be his next target. Right now, most have just tried to stay out of his way. Some, like SoftBank’s Masayoshi Son and Fiat’s Sergio Marchionne, have put forth peace offerings to invest more in the U.S.</p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/01/09/donald-trump-general-motors-mary-barra/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Mary Barra</a><p>Most striking was Ford’s recent decision to reverse plans to build a $1.6 billion plant in Mexico to produce small cars. Then Trump rattled Japan’s leading automobile producer, Toyota, and its CEO, Akio Toyoda, by threatening to slap a “big border tax”—which he has referred to as 35%—on any automobiles the company assembled in Mexico and imported into the U.S.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Marchionne committed to invest $1 billion in two existing U.S. plants and create 2,000 new jobs—investments that were already part of Chrysler’s plans. He said it is “quite possible” his company will abandon Mexican production altogether if Trump’s tariffs are too high.</p><p>Trump didn’t stop with the automakers. He jawboned Carrier into keeping jobs in the United States, threatened Boeing for the cost of Air Force One and Lockheed on its F-35 aircraft, and pharmaceutical companies on their high drug prices.</p><p>There is no doubt that Trump is winning the political game and shaking up America’s largest companies. But there is real danger that his pressure may corrode the competitiveness of U.S.-based global companies and cause retaliation by foreign governments.</p><p>One of America’s greatest strengths is having global companies that dominate their markets around the world through innovation, quality, and marketing. That’s why American companies lead a wide range of industries, from information technology, e-commerce, and social media to finance, pharmaceuticals, medical technology, consumer products, automobiles, farm equipment, and aircraft. They do so profitably with global supply chains that enable them to design and produce products to achieve optimal costs and deliver the greatest value to their customers around the globe. In many countries, they are required to produce a portion of their products locally.</p><p>The global strategies of our corporations have enabled them to compete effectively with Chinese, Japanese, German, and Korean manufacturers—all vigorous competitors striving to win share in global markets. At the same time, they have been profitable enough to reinvest substantial portions of their profits in research, innovation, and product development. When they do so, they stay ahead of their global competitors and increase their market shares. This positive cycle allows them to justify large capital investments in their facilities and provide substantial returns for their shareholders, as share prices for these global companies are at all-time highs.</p><p>Trump has learned how to reach the American people directly through his tweets, thus bypassing mainstream media. With his threats of large tariffs on imported goods, he has succeeded in forcing these giants to make uneconomic decisions—such as Carrier paying $25 per hour to its workers in Indiana to do work that can be done by Mexican employees for $2.50 per hour. However, in the long run, this will be a losing strategy for American workers if it forces Carrier to sell its air conditioners on the world market at non-competitive prices, or replace its production workers with robots, as Tesla&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/tsla\">(TSLA, +2.72%)</a>&nbsp;has done in producing its electric cars. In either case, Carrier will be forced to reduce its Indiana workforce, with its workers ultimately becoming the losers.</p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/tsla\">(TSLA, +2.72%)</a><p>The same logic applies to Ford, General Motors, Chrysler, and Toyota.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/business/2017/01/05/toyota-latest-automaker-feel-heat-trump-tweet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Toyota</a>&nbsp;has created 136,000 American jobs through direct employment, and has invested $21 billion in the U.S. What appear now to be significant “wins” for Trump may turn into pyrrhic victories, as America loses its competitive edge and hiring declines instead of increasing.</p><a href=\"http://www.dallasnews.com/business/business/2017/01/05/toyota-latest-automaker-feel-heat-trump-tweet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Toyota</a><p>Trump has also repeatedly threatened to levy large tariffs on imports from Mexico and China. If he is serious about doing so, he will quickly learn that other countries can also play this game, and are quite willing to do so. This could trigger a trade war that will disadvantage American companies and their employees. Decades of progress in opening up foreign markets to American-made goods could quickly vanish.</p><p>Behind all of the threats and CEO responses lies a much deeper issue: the vital need for America to upgrade its workforce so that American employees can compete for jobs of the future. While there are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7.5 million unemployed</a>&nbsp;Americans as of December 31, 2016, the irony is that there are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/jolts.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5.5 million jobs unfilled</a>, many due to a lack of skilled workers. This situation will get worse in the years ahead as jobs become more complex and require more education and training. Filling these jobs with qualified Americans is essential for the competitiveness of U.S. companies.</p><a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/empsit.nr0.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">7.5 million unemployed</a><a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/jolts.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">5.5 million jobs unfilled</a><p>Rather than jawboning companies to make uneconomic decisions, Trump and Congress should instead work with major employers to train and educate workers. Americans might even find a real strategy that emphasizes preparing for the jobs of the future vs. trying to save the jobs of the past.</p><p>If Trump’s tweets turn into an industrial policy, this may signal that the U.S. is headed into an era of “crony capitalism,” similar to the systems of France and Russia. In contrast, American business has been built on free market principles of market-based competition, free trade, meritocracy, and diversity. For five decades, the U.S. government has worked to ensure U.S. companies are free to sell their goods around the world on a level playing field with local competitors.</p><p>Now it appears the focus may shift to negotiation with the U.S. government over jobs, factory sites, and a host of other issues. If this becomes the prevailing norm, global companies will be reluctant to create new jobs and invest in new factories for fear of being locked into unprofitable decisions. This is a primary reason why France’s current unemployment rate of 9.5% is more than double the U.S.’s relatively modest 4.7% rate.</p><p>Let’s hope the bark of Trump’s Twitter&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/twtr\">(TWTR, -0.20%)</a>&nbsp;account is worse than its bite. If Trump and his new team are wise, they will use his rising popularity to create transformative policy that fosters real growth for the next generation by making America truly competitive in world markets.</p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/twtr\">(TWTR, -0.20%)</a><p><em>Bill George is senior fellow at Harvard Business School, former chair and CEO of Medtronic, and author of Discover Your True North.</em></p><em>Bill George is senior fellow at Harvard Business School, former chair and CEO of Medtronic, and author of Discover Your True North.</em><hr size=\"2\"><p><em>This article was originally published on 1/14/2017 on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/01/14/donald-trump-american-manufacturing-jobs/\">fortune.com</a>.</em></p><em>This article was originally published on 1/14/2017 on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/01/14/donald-trump-american-manufacturing-jobs/\">fortune.com</a>.</em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2017/01/14/donald-trump-american-manufacturing-jobs/\">fortune.com</a><div></div>"

      "<p>The past year has been a painful one for many Americans. Our political differences have separated us into two camps, with angry and hostile words thrown at each other. Long before Election Day, it was clear that regardless of who won, the new President would face a deeply divided nation. Today, weeks after the election, many people are still focusing on the political scene, feeling angst over the latest Cabinet appointment.</p><p>For myself, I have decided to adopt American Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr’s “Serenity Prayer”:</p><p>&nbsp;“God, grant me the <em>serenity</em> to accept the things I cannot change,</p><em>serenity</em><p>&nbsp; <em>courage</em> to change the things I can,</p><em>courage</em><p>&nbsp; And <em>wisdom</em> to know the difference.”</p><em>wisdom</em><p>This prayer challenges us to be <em>serene</em> amid turmoil and chaos, while using <em>courage </em>and <em>wisdom</em> to make a difference in the world. This isn’t easy, but is a goal worth pursuing. Such equipoise is the mark of authentic leaders.</p><em>serene</em><em>courage </em><em>wisdom</em><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Serenity</span></p><span>Serenity</span><p>Accepting the things we cannot change is difficult for anyone with the passion and belief that he or she can change the world for the better. When I was young and naive, I thought I could tackle the world’s greatest problems – from war to health to poverty – and have a leadership role in eliminating them.</p><p>The reality is that none of us can independently eradicate poverty, eliminate disease, ensure quality education, guarantee rewarding jobs for everyone, or ensure all people have financial security. Even Bill Gates must feel humbled by the vastness of the world’s challenges as he applies his vast resources. But if we focus our energy and our efforts on specific goals that are within our grasp, we actually can change the world – the world in which <em>we</em> live.</p><em>we</em><p>Accepting our limits in dealing with intractable problems requires serenity – the quality of being calm and tranquil. When we get caught up in our 24/7 society and upset by the outrage on social media, it is all too easy to become stressed out, discouraged, and angry at the world. When we are too reactive, we lose perspective that our actions are part of the long arch of human progress, and their impact may not be immediately apparent.</p><p>When I feel anxious about the world, I have found my meditation practice helps me regain that sense of tranquility and serenity. It also enables me to focus on the most important things in my life and be grateful for my blessings. In this way, I have learned to accept the things I cannot change. Then I can put aside my frustrations with the world and set more modest goals for things that I can change.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Courage</span></p><span>Courage</span><p>Courage is the quality of the spirit enabling people to face difficulty, danger, and pain without fear. Courage cannot be learned in the classroom; it must be experienced in real world situations.</p><p>At Medtronic, we focused on restoring health for patients struggling with chronic disease and discovering ways to help more people. Our proudest accomplishment during these years was increasing the number of people restored annually to full health from 300,000 to 6 million per year. Today, some 14 years after I retired, that number stands at 30 million people annually.</p><p>In retrospect, growing this number demanded a great deal of courage from my colleagues. They took risks to discover breakthrough therapies, challenge the approval process of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to get them released, and ignore Wall Street’s short-term pressures and invest for the long-term.</p><p>When I retired from Medtronic in 2002, I searched for a new purpose in my professional life. After exploring leadership opportunities in government, business, and non-profits, I went on a working sabbatical in Switzerland to learn and teach at two leading Swiss institutions. It was there that I realized I was most passionate about helping develop a new generation of authentic leaders. I recognized this purpose required a high level of humility about the limits of this goal. There was no chance we could eradicate all the poor leaders, nor claim any credit for the success of the authentic ones. But an emerging new generation of authentic leaders gave me great hope for the future.</p><p>Since 2004, I have pursued that goal by teaching at Harvard Business School (HBS) and applying those ideas through writing books and articles, as well as mentoring many emerging leaders. This took a surprising amount of courage as all my 30 years of experience had been in running large organizations. In Switzerland and at HBS, I was all alone in creating new courses for which I had no training or experience. While my colleagues at HBS were extremely helpful, in the classroom I was on my own with 90 challenging students with very high expectations. When I proposed a new course called Authentic Leadership Development that included a small group format (a radical change for HBS), I was required to go to the dean for approval.</p><p>As a first-time author, I also faced monumental challenges in getting a book published on authentic leaders. My first book draft was rejected by a dozen publishers. Thanks to my mentor, Warren Bennis, I was able to write <em>Authentic Leadership,</em> which was published in 2003 and became a modest best-seller. That gave me the courage to conduct research on 125 authentic leaders and publish <em>True North</em> in 2007, which is widely read today and used by corporations and academic institutions in developing leaders.</p><em>Authentic Leadership,</em><em>True North</em><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Wisdom</span></p><span>Wisdom</span><p>My grandfather, a Dutchman who came to the U.S. in 1878 at the age of two, had a plaque in his home that read: <em>We grow too soon old, and too late wise.</em></p><em>We grow too soon old, and too late wise.</em><p>Wisdom requires discernment and the insights that come from experiencing life’s challenges. It took me decades to recognize how long it takes to acquire wisdom. In my younger years, I thought I was a lot wiser than I was. This was especially true in accepting the limits of my ability. It was only by processing the pain of disappointments and acknowledging my limitations that I gradually accumulated a modest amount of wisdom.</p><p>In college, a wise mentor told me, “Bill, you can’t change human nature,” but I didn’t believe him. It wasn’t until my forties that I accepted just how hard it is to change other people to behave authentically and ethically. You can only have a modest impact on those people you are in direct contact with, and limited impact on others. When I finally accepted this reality, I have found great satisfaction in taking vicarious pleasure – but no credit – in the accomplishments of authentic leaders.</p><p>When we have the wisdom to acknowledge our limits and the limitations of our impact, we can focus our energies on making a difference in our immediate world. Only then can we find the serenity to accept the things we cannot change. This in turn gives us the courage to change the things we can – and realize the fulfillment that comes with it.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>The media has explained the election by creating narratives of the two wealthy New Yorkers who had contrasting beliefs on government, race and gender.</p><p>A look back at the election reveals something more fundamental. Its clear message is a cry from the heart of working class America.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/hillary-clinton/\">Hillary Clinton</a>, a cabinet secretary, senator and first lady, epitomized the establishment while&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a>&nbsp;became a vehicle for Americans’ disillusionment with it.</p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/hillary-clinton/\">Hillary Clinton</a><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/donald-trump/\">Donald Trump</a><p>For two decades America’s working class has worked harder to earn declining incomes just to keep their jobs. They watched as the American dream of a thriving middle class vanished. Many blue-collar workers laid off in the recession of 2009 found themselves taking service jobs that paid just over the minimum wage with no health care benefits.</p><p><em>Tune into&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/power-lunch-cnbc/\">Power Lunch</a>&nbsp;at 1 pm on Friday Nov. 18. Bill George will be a guest.</em></p><em>Tune into&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/power-lunch-cnbc/\">Power Lunch</a>&nbsp;at 1 pm on Friday Nov. 18. Bill George will be a guest.</em><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/power-lunch-cnbc/\">Power Lunch</a><p>Meanwhile, the elite 1 percent accumulated wealth as incomes of bankers and executives escalated rapidly. When CEOs’ compensation averages 400 times their lowest-paid employees, the disparities are no longer acceptable. So they turned out in record numbers and voted to restore their jobs, their lives and their dignity.</p><p>The results of this election should not only be felt in Washington. Business leaders ignore its message at their peril.</p><p>It is the 99 percent of hard-working workers that enable our enterprises to flourish. The task of executives is to create conditions so they can be successful and reward them fairly for their efforts, not to squeeze employees’ incomes in a quixotic quest to maximize shareholder value. While corporate headquarters may be in urban areas, most factories are in the heartland of America that gave Trump his Electoral College triumph.</p><p>At&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/MDT\">Medtronic</a>&nbsp;I told employees, “You make Medtronic successful by carrying out our mission to restore health to millions of people. You create the innovations in the labs, ensure that every product produced is of ‘unsurpassed quality’ and support doctors and nurses to ensure the patient’s health. My job is to create an environment where you can do your jobs well and be rewarded for it.” Losing sight of this principle endangers the social compact that makes capitalism work.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/MDT\">Medtronic</a><p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/WFC\">Wells Fargo</a>&nbsp;former CEO&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/john-stumpf/\">John Stumpf</a>&nbsp;forgot the importance of Wells’ frontline workers. He blamed 5,300 first-line employees terminated for creating 2 million phony consumer accounts. “If they’re not going to . . . put customers first, honor our vision and values, I don’t want them here,” Stumpf said when the crisis became public.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/WFC\">Wells Fargo</a><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/john-stumpf/\">John Stumpf</a><p>It is inconceivable that these employees, most of whom earned $12-14 per hour, all acted independently without direction from their leaders. When the Wells Fargo board “clawed back” only $19 million of retail banking head Carrie Tolstedt’s departing compensation of $124 million, many people compared this to robbing a bank and netting $105 million.</p><p>No wonder people are angry and willing to accept any promise of change. As American companies shutter factories and shift work overseas rather than increasing productivity and innovation here at home, factory workers lose middle class jobs and must choose between low-paying service work or unemployment compensation.</p><p>The solution to wage stagnation and unemployment lies not in cutting interest rates below 0 percent nor in erecting walls around our borders. Rather, we must address the root cause: our failure to train people for today’s and tomorrow’s jobs. As technology has advanced rapidly, we find ourselves with an increasingly obsolete workforce. Thus, the paradox of having 7.8 million people unemployed, while 5.4 million jobs go unfilled for lack of skilled workers.</p><p>For America to succeed in the global economy, we must train people for the jobs of 2020 and pay them fairly. Too many young people graduate from high school and college without the skills required for today’s jobs. Companies fail to train them to become computer operators, robotics technicians, MRI repair people, as well as skilled carpenters, electricians and plumbers. If we don’t correct this problem, social unrest will intensify as the U.S. loses its competitive standing in global industries.</p><p>Contrast this with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/germany/\">Germany</a>. It has long recognized its economic future lies with a highly skilled workforce that enables it to dominate high-tech fields like automobiles, machine tools and chemicals. A significant proportion of German students join apprentice systems that guarantee jobs when they complete their training. German workers earn 50,000 euros per year, have assured pensions and comprehensive health care, and enjoy 4-5 weeks of vacation. They are proud and fulfilled, as they should be, and their high-tech manufacturing companies dominate world markets.</p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/germany/\">Germany</a><p>States and the federal government must take the lead in building our vocational and technical education systems, which should team with local companies to develop German-style apprentice and retraining programs to ensure their employees earn much higher wages. An excellent example can be found in Charlotte, NC, where Central Piedmont Community College with its 70,000 students is teaming with Siemens and local companies to train workers with the high-tech skills they need to compete in the global market. That’s one reason Charlotte has an unemployment rate of only 4.5 percent.</p><p>American companies and their employees will flourish only if we invest in the high-tech workforce that will enable the U.S. to dominate world markets. Business leaders cannot wait for the Trump administration to solve this problem. They need to collaborate with state and local education systems to ensure American workers are the most highly skilled in the world.</p><p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and the author of “Discover Your True North.”</em></p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and the author of “Discover Your True North.”</em><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/16/the-working-persons-cry-from-the-heart.html\">CNBC</a> on 11/17/16.</em></p><em>This article was originally published on <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/16/the-working-persons-cry-from-the-heart.html\">CNBC</a> on 11/17/16.</em><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/16/the-working-persons-cry-from-the-heart.html\">CNBC</a><div></div>"

Here is what leaders should do when confronted by crises:</p><p>—When the first sign of a crisis appears, CEOs and their top teams should go to the site of the problems, witness the extent of the damage first-hand, and apologize to the victims. In the first 48 hours of a crisis, it is critical to be present and to take action, not wait for reports from lower-level teams.</p><p>—An action team of technically competent leaders must work diligently to solve the problems permanently. Only when they are confident that they fully understand the issues can they announce a fix to their customers and take full financial responsibility for its impact.</p><p>—While the people closest to the problem are searching for solutions, their CEO needs to be fully visible, holding daily or weekly press conferences to brief the media and all interested parties, and ensuring full transparency about what the company knows (and doesn’t know). In addition, top executives should hold regular town hall forums for employees, recognizing that whatever is said there becomes public information.</p><p>—Next, they need to create customer and public response teams, composed of top people, not just lawyers and PR specialists, that can respond to all inquiries and provide specific advice about what to do.</p><p>—Finally, they should appoint a senior-level team to reexamine the entire business and its culture, and recommend permanent fixes.</p><p>Leading through a crisis is never easy, yet CEOs who take immediate action and follow a clear, transparent process can use the crisis to transform their institutions for the better, and gain public respect through the process.</p><hr><p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic and author of Discover Your True North.</em></p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic and author of Discover Your True North.</em><p><em>This article was originally published on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/10/13/wells-fargo-crisis-management-reputation/\">Fortune.com</a>&nbsp;on 10/13/16.</em></p><em>This article was originally published on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/10/13/wells-fargo-crisis-management-reputation/\">Fortune.com</a>&nbsp;on 10/13/16.</em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/10/13/wells-fargo-crisis-management-reputation/\">Fortune.com</a><div></div>"

      "<h2>Business leaders have been far too quiet on this key issue.</h2><p>With the presidential election looming, this much is clear: Populism is the big winner in 2016, and America’s global businesses may be the biggest loser.</p><p>Donald Trump claimed the Republican nomination on the strength of a candidacy opposed to free trade. Faced with the insurgent candidacy of Bernie Sanders, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, shifted her positions, most notably now opposing the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).</p><p>Business leaders face a dilemma: what should they do when both candidates are spouting positions that are directly contrary to their interests? Thus far, they are remaining silent, assuming they can recover after the election through an inside game. This may be a historic misjudgment on their part.</p><p>For the past quarter-century, global trade has been the engine of American business growth and its dominance of numerous global markets. Rather than remain silent, business leaders should offer rebuttals, speaking out now to provide policy solutions for the new administration. Let’s look at some of the most vital areas:</p><h2>Free Trade</h2><p>Trade has created millions of jobs in the U.S., far more than jobs lost. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce points out that NAFTA alone created 5 million jobs. Other experts warn that the massive 45% tariff on Chinese imports that Trump proposes would cause a trade war with China striking back with excessive tariffs of its own or banning imports from the U.S. altogether. High tariffs on Chinese and Mexican goods would raise prices for U.S. consumers, hurting lower-incomes families who shop at Walmart (WMT) or Target (TGT).</p><p>As trade has opened up, American companies dominate the list of the world’s most valuable companies. At the end of 2015, 579 of the 2,000 largest companies are U.S.-based. Abandoning free trade risks both jobs and economic value creation.</p><h2>Job Creation</h2><p>Technology and productivity gains, not trade, have held down job creation during the last decade. For example, it takes only 10% as many workers to build a Ford as it did 20 years ago, thanks to automation. Meanwhile, the U.S. auto industry is booming, producing record numbers of vehicles as the Big Three have regained competitiveness with foreign makers. Communications advances have made global outsourcing easier for large U.S. firms who can offshore lower-value jobs, such as customer care or software QA, to cost-effective locations. At Medtronic, we found every factory worker added in our overseas plants created three new jobs in the U.S. in R&amp;D, manufacturing processes, marketing and sales. Silicon Valley companies have an even greater ratio.</p><p>Watch Donald Trump’s speech on trade:</p><h2>Corporate Taxes</h2><p>U.S.-based companies hold more than $2 trillion of cash overseas, because they refuse to pay both overseas taxes and the higher U.S. corporate tax rate of 35% to repatriate the funds. Meanwhile, this money is not being reinvested in the United States. This dysfunctional system makes U.S. companies more valuable to foreign acquirers than their U.S. shareholders, and has caused several companies to relocate their legal headquarters outside of the U.S.</p><p>The U.S. could fix this problem by reducing corporate tax rates while eliminating loopholes in tax policy. Short-term, the government should create a foreign income tax repatriation holiday of taxes at 10-12% for companies with specific plans to reinvest the savings in the U.S. My Harvard Business School colleagues, Michael Porter and Jan Rivkin, would go a step further with territorial taxes that tax profits where they are earned. This would eliminate double-taxation of profits, thereby enabling American companies to redeploy capital in smart investments at home. At the same time, doubling investment tax credits for new tangible assets and increased research and development would strengthen the technology advantage for America’s global companies.</p><h2>Education</h2><p>While unemployment has dropped 50% since President Obama took office, millions of Americans that lost their jobs in the 2008-09 recession lack the skills for today’s positions. The failure of the U.S. Congress to authorize funds for job retraining after the 2008-09 recession has contributed to these problems. Our K-12 and higher education systems also do not produce the talent that innovative companies need to grow.</p><p>In addition to job retraining, the U.S. needs to strengthen its vocational and technical education system, encouraging more high school students to consider these alternatives. Some companies, such as AT&amp;T, are partnering with schools like Georgia Tech to offer specialized online training. The U.S. could do much more to ensure that educational institutions provide the mentoring, faculty and facilities that produce the types of workers companies clamor to hire.</p><h2>Isolationism Won’t Make America Great</h2><p>Concerns about wage stagnation among U.S. workers are legitimate, but they are only part of the broader economic story. Suppressing free trade will harm these workers much more than the companies who can access overseas labor.</p><p>Corporate leaders need to take on the importance of making American companies fully competitive in global markets. A pro-growth agenda—one that educates workers for the future, incentivizes investment and allocates resources effectively through trade—is a far better way to navigate the next decade than practicing the politics of isolationism.</p><p>Business leaders have an important case to make. There are only two months left to speak out.</p><p>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic and author of Discover Your True North.</p><hr><p><span style=\"color: #444444; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;\">This article was originally posted on 9/7/16 on&nbsp;</span><a style=\"color: #21759b; outline: none; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/09/07/free-trade-clinton-trump-business/\">Fortune.com</a><span style=\"color: #444444; font-family: 'Open Sans', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 24px;\">.</span></p><span>This article was originally posted on 9/7/16 on&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/09/07/free-trade-clinton-trump-business/\">Fortune.com</a><span>.</span><div></div>"

      "<p>Many of my most thoughtful colleagues still seem torn about the upcoming presidential election. They are disgusted and frightened by Donald Trump, but uncomfortable with Hillary Clinton. However, I find myself in a very different place.</p><p>Politically, I am an independent who has voted in like measure for Republicans and Democrats. After graduating from business school, I worked in the administrations of Presidents Johnson and Nixon. Like many of my colleagues, I am a fiscal conservative and social progressive who has often struggled to find candidates to support that are aligned with this philosophy.</p><p>In this election the choice between Clinton and Trump is clear: one is fully qualified to be our next President, and the other has neither the experience nor the temperament to be President. For this reason I am enthusiastically endorsing Hillary Clinton for President of the United States. Let me explain my rationale.</p><p>Clinton will be a terrific leader for our country, and will rebuild confidence in our nation for <em>all</em> its people. As several major political leaders, including President Obama, have said, she is the most qualified and most experienced person ever to run for president. She has the intellect, temperament, wisdom, and leadership ability to bring us together as a nation and lead us forward. I trust her fully to use her experience to make the right decisions and always put the interests of the American public ahead of her own needs. She will also unleash fresh energy from new faces or those who have been sitting on the sidelines, dismayed by the dysfunctional of government.</p><em>all</em><p>Having been in public service for twenty-five years, her actions have been scrutinized in every possible way. This has caused her to be guarded in public. As she noted in her acceptance speech, “I have been in public service for twenty-five years. I realize I am more comfortable with service than being public.” That is not unusual for politicians seeking our nation’s highest office. Former Presidents Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, and Ronald Reagan were often reticent publicly, as is President Obama.</p><p>No doubt Clinton has made mistakes, as she did with her private email server, but which of us has not made significant mistakes in our careers that we have come to regret? The issue for politicians like Clinton is that everything you do is examined with a microscope in the public eye. In contrast, Clinton’s opponent has never held a public or elected position, so he has no record of service to examine.</p><p>A majority of Americans are looking for change in electing our next president, but there is no agreement on what that change might look like. In my experience there are two ways to create change: blow the system up and start over, or work diligently for change from within. There is ample evidence that the former cannot work in the U.S., especially under the U.S. Constitution with its proven system of balance of power. The French tried it in 1789, leading to a long period of chaos. The Germans tried it in 1933 when the Nazis seized power and Adolf Hitler was elected Chancellor, leading to the most violent war in history.</p><p>Real change is genuinely hard work and must come from within. This is where Clinton excels. Everyone who has worked with her – Republicans as well as Democrats – has come to admire her work ethic and her ability to create positive action. She realizes changes by working with all sides and across the aisle to reach compromise agreements that serve the greater good. This kind of change is never glamorous or exciting, but it is the only way to make meaningful progress. Clinton’s record of creating improvements domestically in education, health care, human rights and equality for all is exceptional.</p><p>In international affairs presidents have even greater latitude to make monumental decisions with lasting consequences. Not infrequently, presidents who lack deep knowledge of foreign affairs can make major mistakes, as John Kennedy did with the Bay of Pigs, Lyndon Johnson did in escalating U.S. troops in Vietnam, and George W. Bush made in invading Iraq. Government leaders around the world – friend and foe alike – rely on the stability of the U.S. to deliver on its long-term commitments. In large measure this is why Republicans and Democrats have been unified in their international positions since the 1940s. It is this unity that has made America the greatest nation in the world.</p><p>In this realm Clinton stands out even more. She will use her leadership, diplomacy and negotiating skills to advance U.S. interests around the world. She knows every world leader personally and can gauge and influence their actions. In turn, they know her to be both tough and trustworthy – two essential qualities for dealing with both friends and foes. She will not flinch from confronting our foes, nor fail to honor our long-standing commitments to our allies.</p><p>Being president is not a one-person job. While the president may be the person constantly in the spotlight, it takes thousands of exceptional leaders to lead this nation. With Clinton’s long history of working with the most dedicated U.S. public servants, I expect she will appoint a talented team of experienced veterans combined with dedicated new faces across the political and geographic spectrum that represents America’s great diversity. This is what capable leaders like Clinton do so well.</p><p>Of particular importance in this election are the Millennials and their involvement with national affairs. Clinton’s biggest challenge between now and November will be to get the Millennials engaged to focus their enormous passions on making America a better place to live and work for their generation and those that come behind.</p><p>For all these reasons I endorse Hillary Clinton for President. I urge each of you to support her and get behind her campaign. She is the right leader for turbulent times. As President, Hillary Clinton will make America even greater.</p><div></div>"

They also discounted the apathy of the millennial generation, which favored Remain but only 36% voted.</p><p>The U.S. faces similar issues: working class anger, hostility toward the federal government, and a desire to blame problems on “the other”—Hispanic people, Muslims, African-Americans, and China. These emotions translate into fears of immigration, globalization, free trade, and technology—all themes that fan flames of distrust in government and the establishment.</p><p>American business leaders who ignore their workers’ feelings do so at their own peril. Unhappy employees lead to disengaged workplaces and mediocre results. Here are five lessons they can learn from Brexit to apply immediately in their businesses:</p><p><strong>Focus on your workforce first and stock market second</strong></p><strong>Focus on your workforce first and stock market second</strong><p>As the near-term pressures from short-term investors have accelerated, business leaders have engaged in financial engineering such as stock buybacks, cost cutting, and spinoffs. As a consequence, companies aren’t investing in their employees. Health care, perquisites, and other benefits are being cut back, employee training programs shelved, and support for creativity and innovation diminished, while the gap in compensation between rank-and-file workers and executives has widened dramatically. With employee cutbacks, fewer people are being asked to carry a larger share of the workload.</p><p>According to Gallup polls,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/188144/employee-engagement-stagnant-2015.aspx\">employee engagement scores have dropped to 30% or lower</a>. More people are simply showing up to pick up a paycheck, while their passion for the business and commitment to pleasing customers has waned.</p><a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/188144/employee-engagement-stagnant-2015.aspx\">employee engagement scores have dropped to 30% or lower</a><p>To turn around these attitudes, business leaders need to stop trying to please the stock market – which will never be satisfied, no matter how strong the results – and engage and inspire their front-line people. Instead of cutting employee costs, they should be investing in them through training, added compensation incentives, attractive healthcare, and by creating an empowering culture.</p><p><strong>Support front-line employees who grow the business, instead of adding corporate bureaucracy that makes work more difficult</strong></p><strong>Support front-line employees who grow the business, instead of adding corporate bureaucracy that makes work more difficult</strong><p>All too often, managers see their job as controlling employees throughout the enterprise. Finance groups focus on cost-cutting, risk-averse lawyers make the company impossible to do business with, and human resources casts judgment on employees. As a result, corporate departments at many businesses have grown while the rest of the organization has shrunk, causing resentment.</p><p>Meanwhile, top executives spend most of their time in internal meetings poring over numbers rather than listening to employees in research labs, offices, and factories.</p><p>Corporate staffs in multi-business companies should be shrunk dramatically in size and refocused on helping employees do their jobs and making it easier for customers to do business. Accenture, with its 275,000 employees, is a good example of this approach. It has no true corporate headquarters, and its minimal corporate staff is dispersed around the world and focused on supporting customers.</p><p><strong>Spend one-third of your time with customers</strong></p><strong>Spend one-third of your time with customers</strong><p>Whether you’re in retail, health care, IT, or financial services, there is no greater place for learning what is going on than being in the marketplace with customers. When I was at Medtronic, I observed more than 700 procedures in 12 years; it was the greatest learning opportunity I ever had. Leaders who apply all five senses to customer interactions learn more first-hand than they do from reading reports or looking at PowerPoint presentations.</p><p>When he became CEO of Unilever&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/ul/\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"http://fortune.com/company/ul/\">UL</a>&nbsp;0.32%&nbsp;, Paul Polman asked his leaders 10 questions to see how much time they were spending with customers.

      "<p>The debate over which form of leadership works best seems settled, in my view. Most leading companies globally are focusing on developing “authentic leaders” within their ranks. Executive courses at Harvard Business School in authentic leadership development are oversubscribed and expanding every year. As the&nbsp;Harvard Business Review&nbsp;declared in January 2015, “Authenticity has emerged as the gold standard for leadership.”</p><p>In 2003, our book&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Authentic-Leadership-Rediscovering-Secrets-Creating/dp/0787975281\">Authentic Leadership</a>&nbsp;proposed a new kind of leader, whose character was the ingredient that mattered most—more than characteristics or style. We also challenged older models of leadership, including the “great man theory” and competency-based leadership models. Previous generations of business people spent more time trying to “market” themselves as leaders, rather than undertaking the transformative work that leadership development requires.</p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Authentic-Leadership-Rediscovering-Secrets-Creating/dp/0787975281\">Authentic Leadership</a><h4>Critiques of authenticity</h4><p>But recently three leading scholars at Insead, Stanford, and Wharton challenged the concept of authentic leadership. Like all movements—Harvard University Professor Michael Porter’s famous five forces of strategy comes to mind—growing acceptance of an idea often attracts contrarian critiques, which ultimately are healthy in clarifying our understanding.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-BS-Fixing-Workplaces-Careers/dp/0062383167\">Leadership BS</a>, Stanford’s Jeff Pfeffer says, “the last thing a leader needs to be at crucial moments is authentic.” Insead’s Herminia Ibarra adds, “We have to find a way to fake it till we become it.” The most recent salvo comes from Wharton’s Adam Grant, who wrote in the June 5&nbsp;New York Times, “’Be yourself’ is actually terrible advice… Nobody wants to see your true self.”</p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Leadership-BS-Fixing-Workplaces-Careers/dp/0062383167\">Leadership BS</a><p>“AUTHENTIC LEADERS MONITOR THEIR WORDS AND BEHAVIORS CAREFULLY TO BE ATTUNED TO THEIR AUDIENCES AND TO ENROLL THEIR COLLEAGUES AND TEAMMATES”</p><p>While these writings have garnered plenty of press attention, their critiques of authentic leaders reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of authenticity. Webster defines authenticity as “real or genuine; not copied or false; true and accurate.” It comes from the Greek word for author, which led author Warren Bennis to say, “You are the author of your life.”</p><p>Ibarra postulates two types of authentic leaders: “low self-monitors” and “high self-monitors.” Low self-monitors tend to say whatever comes to mind, whereas high self-monitors watch carefully what they say for its impact on others. This distinction creates a false dichotomy because low self-monitoring is the opposite of being authentic, and is a sign of immaturity and insensitivity to the feelings of others. Leaders who do this, such as telling a colleague, “I’d like to go to bed with you,” as Grant proposes, are anything but authentic.</p><p>Authentic leaders monitor their words and behaviors carefully to be attuned to their audiences and to enroll their colleagues and teammates. They do so because they are sensitive to the impact their words and actions have on others, not because they are “messaging” the right talking points.</p><p>Ibarra’s second critique of authentic leaders is that they are often locked into a rigid sense of themselves, much like their immature teenage selves. This is the antithesis of authentic leaders, who are constantly developing themselves to increase self-awareness and improve relationships with others. They don’t hide behind their flaws; instead, they seek to understand them. This lifelong developmental process is similar to what musicians and athletes go through in improving their capabilities.</p><h4>How leaders develop their authenticity</h4><p>Rather than trying to redefine what it means to be authentic, research and leadership development programs should focus on&nbsp;how&nbsp;leaders develop their authenticity. Being authentic as a leader is hard work and takes years of experience in leadership roles. No one can be authentic without fail; everyone behaves inauthentically at times, saying and doing things they will come to regret. The key is to have the self-awareness to recognize these times and listen to close colleagues who point them out.</p><p>The essence of authentic leadership is emotional intelligence, or EQ, as articulated by Daniel Goleman. People with high IQs and low EQs can hardly be called authentic leaders. In contrast to IQ, which basically does not change in one’s adult lifetime, EQ can be developed. The first and most important step on this journey is gaining self-awareness.</p><p>In preparing to write&nbsp;<a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/\">Discover Your True North</a>, my research team and I conducted in-depth interviews with 172 authentic leaders. This research highlighted the vital role of self-awareness in leadership development. Here are some recommended steps people undertake to develop a deeper understanding of themselves in order to become authentic leaders:</p><a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/\">Discover Your True North</a><ul>\n<li>Explore their life stories and their crucibles&nbsp;in order to understand who they are. As my HBS colleague Lakshmi Ramarajan says, the process of learning, growing, and developing an integrated self is a process of construction and meaning–making. As leaders explore their life stories and crucibles, and process their experiences, they develop deeper understanding of themselves and feel increasingly comfortable being authentic. This is a lifelong journey in which we are always discovering the next layer, much like peeling an onion. As leaders discover their truth, their True North, they gain confidence and resilience to face difficult situations.</li>\n<li>Engage in reflection and introspective practices&nbsp;by taking time every day to step back from the 24/7 world, turn off all electronics, and reflect on what is most important to them. This can be done through introspective practices that are growing rapidly in popularity, such as meditation, mindfulness, prayer, long walks to clear one’s mind, or simply sitting quietly and reflecting. The key here is set aside preoccupation with task lists, iPhones, and the latest news in order to reflect privately. In this way the urgent does not take precedence over the important in one’s life, and leaders examine how they are living their lives and engaging with the world around them.</li>\n<li>Seeking honest feedback&nbsp;from colleagues, friends, and subordinates about themselves and their leadership. One of the hardest things for leaders to do is to understand how other people see them, which is often quite different than how they want to be seen. To gain greater understanding of how they are coming across, authentic leaders obtain real-time feedback by listening to their “truth tellers,” who give them candid critiques about their leadership. Those that surround themselves with loyal sycophants, who only tell them how well they are doing rather than being brutally honest, risk going off track. Leaders also gather feedback through regular 360 degree reviews from peers and subordinates. The qualitative comments shared in 360 reviews can be of great benefit if leaders take them to heart, and genuinely try to change.</li>\n<li>Understand their leadership purpose&nbsp;so they can align people around a common purpose. Purpose defines the unique gifts people bring to leadership challenges, through which they can align others with their purposes in order to create positive impact. This is far more important than focusing entirely on achieving success in metrics like money, fame and power, yet ultimately produces sustained success in those metrics as well.</li>\n<li>Become skilled at tailoring their style&nbsp;to their audiences, imperatives of the situation, and readiness of their teammates to accept different approaches. There are times when leaders have to make difficult decisions that are sure to displease people, and they’ll need to give tough feedback. At other times they need to be inspiring, good coaches, and consensus builders. These flexible styles aren’t inauthentic if they come from a genuinely authentic place. In this sense leaders’ styles become the outward manifestation of their authenticity. As leaders gain experience and develop greater self-awareness, they become more skillful in adapting their style, without compromising their character.</li>\n</ul><li>Explore their life stories and their crucibles&nbsp;in order to understand who they are.

In this sense leaders’ styles become the outward manifestation of their authenticity. As leaders gain experience and develop greater self-awareness, they become more skillful in adapting their style, without compromising their character.</li><p>What is needed now is a deeper understanding of how leaders become authentic, as they navigate the practical dilemmas and paradoxes they face. For example, Karissa Thacker’s recent book&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119153425.html\">The Art of Authenticity&nbsp;</a>takes authenticity to a deeper level by exploring topics like relational transparency and honest conversations, making peace with paradox, and seeking the truth.</p><a href=\"http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1119153425.html\">The Art of Authenticity&nbsp;</a><p>My colleagues at HBS are working on the challenges of being authentic, such as how and when to be vulnerable, cognitive distortions, making meaning of who we are by integrating the constructed self with the true self—or True North—and going from purpose to impact. These are fertile areas for research by academics and in-company leadership experts.</p><p>Rather than creating false postulations about authentic leaders, we need to focus on how we can enable leaders to become more authentic, and give them the tools to do so. In this way authentic leaders will be able to create better lives for everyone they serve.</p><p><em>Bill George is&nbsp;Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of Discover Your True North.</em></p><em>Bill George is&nbsp;Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of Discover Your True North.</em><hr><p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/the-truth-about-authentic-leaders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Harvard Business School Working Knowledge</a> on 7/6/16.&nbsp;</em></p><em>This content was originally posted on <a href=\"https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/the-truth-about-authentic-leaders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Harvard Business School Working Knowledge</a> on 7/6/16.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/the-truth-about-authentic-leaders\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Harvard Business School Working Knowledge</a><div></div>"

      "<p>Diverse, welcoming companies perform better than their more homogeneous competitors.</p><p>Want to become a top performing company? Create a diverse leadership team that reflects the diversity of the customers you serve, and ensure that everyone on your team feels fully included as a vital member.</p><p><a style=\"color: #21759b; outline: none;\" href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/target-38\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Target</a>, the nation’s No. 3 retailer, has long been a role model for diversity. Its board of directors includes only five white males among 14 members. They serve with six women, two African Americans, and three Hispanic people. It’s a group that reflects Target’s highly diverse customer base, where women make more than 70% of buying decisions. The company’s top management is equally diverse, with five women on its 11-person executive committee.</p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/target-38\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Target</a><p>Target is also one of the most progressive companies when it comes to welcoming gays and lesbians. And CEO Brian Cornell actively responded to reactionary forces trying to limit transgender persons’ use of gender-appropriate restrooms. In a&nbsp;<a style=\"color: #21759b; outline: none;\" href=\"https://corporate.target.com/article/2016/04/target-stands-inclusivity\">recent announcement</a>, Cornell said transgender people can use the gender restroom they identify with at Target locations.</p><a href=\"https://corporate.target.com/article/2016/04/target-stands-inclusivity\">recent announcement</a><p>When the American Family Association organized a boycott of the retailer, claiming one million signatures, Cornell did not back down. “We’ve had a long history of embracing diversity and inclusion,” he said on CNBC, noting Target used African-American models in its ads as early as the 1960s.</p><p>Challenges to diversity are certainly not exclusive to business boycotts. They are playing out in state governments as well. When North Carolina’s state legislature created an uproar by passing a bill that would restrict transgender persons from using gender-appropriate public restrooms, former presidential advisor and North Carolina native David Gergen spoke out forcefully about the harm this law would create. In his commencement speech at North Carolina’s Elon University, Gergen told an audience of 12,000 that “forces of political extremism” were damaging the state’s reputation. “Enough is enough,” he declared. “It is time to raise our voices against this darkness. Indeed, it is time for fellow citizens of all stripes – white and black; young and old; native and newcomer – to join forces and preserve the best of who we are as a people.”</p><p>Other leaders are speaking out, too. In Georgia, vocal pressure from Salesforce’s Marc Benioff, Delta’s Richard Anderson, and Georgia Tech President Bud Peterson persuaded Governor Nathan Deal to veto similarly restrictive legislation.</p><p><strong>Diversity Is a Competitive Advantage</strong></p><strong>Diversity Is a Competitive Advantage</strong><p>In spite of some politicians’ attempts to stir up resistance to diversity, there is remarkably strong consensus from business leaders on the matter. They view diversity as a competitive advantage. To make sound decisions, these executives believe diverse points of view must be included.</p><p>Studies demonstrate that more diverse businesses perform better than their less diverse competitors.&nbsp;<a style=\"color: #21759b; outline: none;\" href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters\">McKinsey research</a>&nbsp;has shown that companies in the top quartile for racial and ethnic diversity were 35% more likely to have higher financial returns than companies in the bottom quartile of diversity. For every 10% increase in racial diversity on the senior executive team, earnings before interest and taxes rose by 0.8%.</p><a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/organization/our-insights/why-diversity-matters\">McKinsey research</a><p><a style=\"color: #21759b; outline: none;\" href=\"http://www.calstrs.com/sites/main/files/file-attachments/csri_gender_diversity_and_corporate_performance.pdf\">In a study of 2,360 companies</a>, Credit Suisse found a positive relationship between the number of women on a board and return on equity. Similarly, when experimenters compared the composition of team members and the team’s success, they found that the number of women in the group was the strongest predictor of success. This far exceeded the predictive power of individual IQs, group cohesion, or even group motivation.</p><a href=\"http://www.calstrs.com/sites/main/files/file-attachments/csri_gender_diversity_and_corporate_performance.pdf\">In a study of 2,360 companies</a><p><strong>Attracting Better Talent</strong></p><strong>Attracting Better Talent</strong><p>If companies want to have the most capable leaders, they will have to create workplaces that are both open and welcoming to everyone.

Instead, companies need a critical mass of diverse people who feel included in all decisions and respected for their contributions. No one wants to be singled out or given special treatment for their diversity status; they want to feel welcome, included, and valued for their talents.</p><p>Many companies work hard to hire diverse individuals, but they do little internally to prevent them from receiving unfavorable treatment. Researchers from the National Academy of Sciences recently completed a study that showed that minority employees feel they have to achieve a<a style=\"color: #21759b; outline: none;\" href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/14/1211286109\">higher standard of performance</a>&nbsp;to receive the same credit as other individuals.</p><a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2012/09/14/1211286109\">higher standard of performance</a><p>Leaders must ask questions about inclusion, such as “Have you noticed any other obstacles in the way to your success?” or “In terms of mentorship and promotion, do you sense that those happen without bias?” Nothing can change immediately, but small steps like these can add up.</p><p>Diversity and inclusion are no longer just social or moral questions. They are competitive requirements for every company.</p><p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of Discover Your True North.</em></p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of Discover Your True North.</em><hr><p>\n</p><p><em>The original content of this article was posted on&nbsp;<a style=\"color: #21759b; outline: none;\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/06/13/one-of-the-best-ways-to-become-a-top-performing-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fortune.com</a>&nbsp;on 6/13/16.&nbsp;</em></p><em>The original content of this article was posted on&nbsp;<a style=\"color: #21759b; outline: none;\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/06/13/one-of-the-best-ways-to-become-a-top-performing-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fortune.com</a>&nbsp;on 6/13/16.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/06/13/one-of-the-best-ways-to-become-a-top-performing-company/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fortune.com</a>"

      "<p>With Dr. Glen Nelson’s death this month, Minnesota lost a giant who led the building of our health care system for the past 40 years, making health care more effective, accessible, and efficient for everyone.</p><p>After graduating from the University of Minnesota Medical School, he began his career as a surgeon at Park Nicollet Medical Center. Nelson built Park Nicollet into a progressive multi-specialty practice as its president and CEO.</p><p>During the early 1980s, he helped create the health maintenance organization American MedCenters, becoming its chairman and CEO. He was part of the Jackson Hole Group, a leading proponent of managed competition in health care that influenced President Bill Clinton’s health care plan and President Obama’s Affordable Care Act. Joining Medtronic in 1986, he teamed with CEO Win Wallin and myself to transform Medtronic from a pacemaker pioneer into the world’s leading medical technology ­company.</p><p>From 1986 to his retirement in 2002, Nelson led Medtronic’s introduction of 12 major advances in medicine. The company achieved breakthroughs that included the pacemaker-cardioverter-defibrillator and treatments for heart failure, incontinence, and Parkinson’s disease.</p><p>I first got to know Glen in the 1970s, but our deeper relationship began in 1989 when I joined Medtronic. We formed a partnership, with Glen taking the lead on all aspects of medicine and technology, both internally and through acquisitions and mergers. We teamed together on strategy and organization, and in resolving the most difficult issues facing the company, from FDA relationships to thorny quality and people issues. He served on the Medtronic board for 20 years, guiding it to aspire to greater heights for the company.</p><p>In no small measure, he played a leading role in the company’s growth from $400 million in revenue to its current size of $29 billion in revenue and market capitalization of $112 billion, making it one of the nation’s most valuable companies.</p><p>Glen’s impact as a human being far exceeded his tangible accomplishments. To me, he was a friend, colleague, and mentor. When I was elected CEO of Medtronic in early 1991, I asked Glen to be my partner, not a subordinate, and to consult with me on all decisions, large and small.</p><p>He was the smartest and wisest person I have ever known. When I arrived at Medtronic, I had 25 years of high-tech experience but knew nothing about medicine. I relied on Glen to teach me the medical business and to explain how our products worked inside the human body. We worked together on a wide array of acquisitions, as we endeavored to broaden Medtronic’s technology to treat diseases as diverse as cerebral palsy, sleep apnea, diabetes and spinal surgery.</p><p>In 1998, Medtronic faced a growth crisis; expansion in our core business had slowed to less than 7 percent, well below our historic 18 percent growth rate. Several key executives recommended retrenching to cardiac rhythm management, which would have spelled Medtronic’s death knell as an independent company.</p><p>Instead, I asked Glen to ramp up our acquisition efforts. Within months, we made six major acquisitions totaling $13 billion and transformed Medtronic from a cardiac rhythm company into the world leader in medical technology. Had it not been for Glen’s perceptive judgment and his skill at working with entrepreneurs, this never would have been possible.</p><p>After retiring from Medtronic, Glen devoted himself to helping young entrepreneurs translate their ideas into successful companies. At his peak, he served on 13 boards, as he became the “go to” person for aspiring innovators. He could never say no and always took time to help anyone who asked. No wonder so many people loved and admired him.</p><p>Glen Nelson was a visionary, entrepreneur and pioneer. More than anyone else, he understood the intersection of medicine and technology and what advances would work inside the human body. Far beyond that, he was a compassionate leader who strove to help people both inside and outside Medtronic.</p><p>His loss will be widely felt locally and nationally, as he leaves an unparalleled legacy for others to emulate in helping people create medical breakthroughs.</p><p><em>Bill George, the former chairman and CEO of Medtronic, is senior fellow at Harvard Business School and author of “Discover Your True North.”</em></p><em>Bill George, the former chairman and CEO of Medtronic, is senior fellow at Harvard Business School and author of “Discover Your True North.”</em><hr><p><em>This article was originally posted to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/dr-glen-nelson-was-minnesota-s-medical-pioneer/380319681/\">Startribune.com</a>&nbsp;on 5/22/2016.</em></p><em>This article was originally posted to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/dr-glen-nelson-was-minnesota-s-medical-pioneer/380319681/\">Startribune.com</a>&nbsp;on 5/22/2016.</em><a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/dr-glen-nelson-was-minnesota-s-medical-pioneer/380319681/\">Startribune.com</a>"

Most companies have navigated these fast-changing times well. But three bad actors – former Turing CEO Martin Shkreli, former&nbsp;Valeant CEO Michael Pearson, and Theranos’ Elizabeth Holmes – threaten to drag down the legitimate companies.</p><p><strong>The Price Gouger</strong></p><strong>The Price Gouger</strong><p>Pharma’s bad boy Shkreli became the poster child for abusing patients through price gouging by hiking the price of Daraprim, a 62-year-old HIV/AIDS drug, from $13.50 to $750 per pill. Then he had the audacity to flaunt it by saying, “I wish I had raised prices more.” Merck CEO Ken Frazier called Shkreli “a hedge fund guy masquerading as a pharmaceutical executive.”</p><p>Shkreli incurred the wrath of the general public. Even presidential candidates rebuked him. His actions had broad implications because they threatened the already unsteady alliance between big pharmaceutical companies and the Obama Administration. These pharmaceutical companies had agreed to pay $70 billion to support ACA in exchange for a legal restriction on the U.S. government in negotiating drug prices.</p><p><strong>The “Quick Fix” CEO</strong></p><strong>The “Quick Fix” CEO</strong><p>Valeant’s Pearson also raised prices 500-800% on older drugs, but his flawed approach went much further. He claimed his company did not need to do research on new drugs because it could simply buy older drugs and take over companies like Salix and Bausch &amp; Lomb. His business model called for limiting drug development expenses to 3% of revenues and paying only 3% in taxes through a series of clever tax schemes. Big investors like Sequoia, Pershing Square, and Value Act talked up the stock as Valeant’s market capitalization rose to $91 billion. And several other mid-sized pharmaceutical companies copied Valeant’s approach.</p><p>Those with a long-term view called out Valeant’s short-term game. Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton ran ads attacking the company. Warren Buffett&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/02/warren-buffett-dont-run-a-company-like-michael-pearson-ran-valeant.html\">told CNBC</a>, “You wouldn’t want your son to grow up like Mike Pearson.” Buffett’s partner, Charlie Munger, called Valeant a “sewer.” The game ran out when a short-seller exposed Valeant’s distribution through specialty pharmacies that forced enormous price increases. In the past six months, Valeant investors have lost $81 billion, dragging down the activist funds that propelled the company’s growth.</p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/05/02/warren-buffett-dont-run-a-company-like-michael-pearson-ran-valeant.html\">told CNBC</a><p><strong>The Promoter</strong></p><strong>The Promoter</strong><p>Theranos’ Holmes claimed her company could render obsolete the one billion blood draws done in the U.S. with a simple prick of the finger – an exciting prospect that caused investors to value her private company at $9.1 billion. Her board of directors included several former U.S. senators and former presidential cabinet members, but few with experience in medical technology.</p><p>With her story and her glamour, Holmes became the darling of the media and Silicon Valley moguls. Theranos went directly to the consumer market by cutting big deals with Walgreens and Safeway, but Holmes never produced any test data to validate the claims, citing confidentiality concerns. The media passively accepted her lack of transparency.</p><p>Then the<em>&nbsp;Wall Street Journal</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901\">published</a>&nbsp;an expose calling into question the effectiveness of the company’s testing methods and scrutinizing its resistance to share test results to back up its claims. WSJ published this piece in spite of heavy pressure from Theranos’ legal team, which was led by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/05/theranos-silicon-valley-media\">high-profile lawyer David Boies</a>. Since the WSJ article was published, the company has imploded. Now the U.S. government has launched a criminal investigation to determine whether Holmes intentionally misled her investors. Thus far, Holmes has yet to produce validated test results proving Theranos’ claims.</p><em>&nbsp;Wall Street Journal</em><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901\">published</a><a href=\"http://www.vanityfair.com/news/2016/05/theranos-silicon-valley-media\">high-profile lawyer David Boies</a><p><strong>A Hippocratic Oath for Health Care Companies</strong></p><strong>A Hippocratic Oath for Health Care Companies</strong><p>While these three companies and their leaders will be mere footnotes in business history, they cause great harm to legitimate companies trying to help patients. Their missteps confirm the importance of putting patients first, rigorous testing, FDA oversight, transparency, and pricing products to support patient access, regardless of their income bracket.</p><p>When scandals occur, they have a negative impact on companies that are doing things right. The subsequent public outcry tends to harm the committed, experienced companies, as politicians paint all health care companies with the same brush. This leads to delays in the FDA approval process for the most scientifically minded companies, denying patients products they need. It also creates public pressure for price controls.</p><p>Theranos, Valeant, and Turing took multiple shortcuts, and they won handsome short-term rewards for their behavior. But others who jumped on board have now lost billions. Neither Shkreli, Pearson, nor Holmes had any health care experience before taking over their companies: Shkreli worked at hedge funds, Pearson was a McKinsey consultant, and Holmes was a 19-year-old freshman at Stanford. Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg’s motto of “move fast and break things” may be valid for social media, but it doesn’t work for heart surgery, drug development, or medical devices.</p><p>The first rule of the Hippocratic Oath all doctors take is, “First, do no harm.” Why did Theranos, Valeant, and Turing assume so much risk? They focused on the short-term at the expense of their companies, their patients, and the health care industry. These companies proved what others have known all along: when you’re dealing with human health, shortcuts backfire.</p><p>Worst of all, these three companies fostered the impression that health care companies try to take advantage of an unsuspecting public. As a result, legitimate medical entrepreneurs now have trouble finding the funding required to do rigorous clinical trials in leading academic medical centers—something that Theranos refused to do.</p><p>For capitalism to work in the medical field, companies must be able to make the long-term investments required for breakthrough bio-pharmaceuticals and medical therapies. There are no shortcuts and no quick paths to market, but the long-term payoff can be enormous.</p><p>Investors with a fiduciary responsibility to their clients should carefully evaluate the leaders of companies they are investing in to ascertain their medical expertise and soundness. Entrepreneurs, who are essential to foster medical breakthroughs, need to learn the lessons from these bad actors and avoid taking shortcuts when human lives are at stake. We need to be patient with healthcare timelines, so we can enjoy the tremendous benefits that legitimate companies can offer.</p><p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of Discover Your True North.</em></p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of Discover Your True North.</em><hr size=\"1\"><p><em>This article was originally published by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/05/10/meet-health-cares-major-spoilers-theranos-valeant-and-turing-pharmaceuticals/\">Fortune.com</a>&nbsp;on 5/10/16</em></p><em>This article was originally published by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/05/10/meet-health-cares-major-spoilers-theranos-valeant-and-turing-pharmaceuticals/\">Fortune.com</a>&nbsp;on 5/10/16</em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/05/10/meet-health-cares-major-spoilers-theranos-valeant-and-turing-pharmaceuticals/\">Fortune.com</a><div></div>"

      "<p>Earning money and having power over others are easy ways to gauge success. But they’re also limited.</p><p>Open your eyes, look within. Are you satisfied with the life you’re living? —Bob Marley</p><p>In my forties, I was unhappy with my career and where it was heading.</p><p>Driving home on a beautiful fall afternoon, I looked in the rearview mirror and saw a miserable person—me. On the surface, I appeared to be confident and successful, but inside I was deeply unhappy.</p><p>For 20 years, I had been a successful executive on a fast track to the top, or so I hoped. I was getting closer to that goal, as I took on responsibility for Honeywell’s most challenging businesses. At the time, I was on my third set of turnarounds, responsible for three groups, nine divisions, and 18,000 employees. Yet I began to wonder if Honeywell was the right place for me.<br>\nAs executive vice president of Space and Aviation Systems, my team and I uncovered losses exceeding $500 million that had not been recognized or accounted for properly. Presenting this news to Honeywell’s board caused a great deal of concern. As I said to myself repeatedly, “I didn’t create this mess. I’m just the guy who has to fix it.” I always saw myself as a builder, not a turnaround expert, but I did what needed to be done to restore Honeywell’s businesses to long-term health.</p><br><p>But on that autumn day, I realized I wasn’t passionate about Honeywell’s businesses. Even worse, I was becoming more concerned about becoming CEO than being a leader who could make a positive impact on the world. I faced the reality that Honeywell was changing me more than I was changing it—and I didn’t like the changes I saw in myself.</p><p>David Brooks’ The Road to Character challenges us to consider our resume virtues against our eulogy virtues. Resume virtues are what we write about ourselves to measure up to the world’s expectations. Eulogy virtues are what others say about us at our funeral: what kind of person we were and how we cared for others.</p><p>Many of us focus on resume virtues because they’re easy to measure and give us superficial self-esteem. Earning a lot of money, receiving promotions and prestigious titles, and having power over others are easy ways to gauge success. But more difficult tasks—like making a positive difference in the lives of others or becoming the type of person you want to be—have few measurable benchmarks.</p><p>When I was at Honeywell HON -0.16% , I had all the trappings of success, but my life lacked the significance I yearned for. That day I recognized I needed to get back to what I call my True North. Your True North, which is derived from your beliefs, values, and the principles you use to lead others, is your internal compass. It’s unique to you and it represents who you are at your deepest level.</p><p>With my wife Penny’s encouragement and support from my men’s group, I reopened job discussions with medical device company Medtronic MDT 0.25% , which was at the time a much smaller company but one with a passion to help millions of people live a full, healthy life. After having interviews with the CEO, the founder, and board members, I accepted Medtronic’s offer and became president and chief operating officer at the company. Two years later, I was elected CEO.</p><p>At Medtronic, I found a place—or it found me—that let me focus on significance over success. Medtronic’s mission inspired me from the moment its founder Earl Bakken described it to me. When I arrived in 1989, Medtronic helped restore someone to health once every 100 seconds. By the time I completed my tenure in 2002, that figure had fallen to five seconds. Today it is down to one second, with 30 million new patients every year. That’s a much more meaningful metric than a stock price.</p><p>What’s significant in your life may change over time. After retiring from Medtronic in my late 50s, my purpose changed from leading large organizations to helping other people lead authentically by discovering their True North. Teaching authentic leadership at Harvard Business School the past 15 years, I receive a modest salary and have no positional power, yet I find great significance in the work I am doing. As one friend told me, “Bill, you seem to take vicarious pleasure in the accomplishments of others.” Indeed, I do.</p><p>While helping people lead authentically is my mission, it doesn’t impede other areas of deep importance to me. My family, friends, colleagues, and mentees provide consistent sources of significance. In 1975, I began a men’s group with four close friends after a weekend retreat, and four others soon joined us. Forty years later, we’re still meeting weekly to discuss our spiritual beliefs, our aspirations, career challenges, marriage and family problems, and the process of personal development.</p><p>How will you measure your life? That’s the title of my HBS colleague Clay Christensen’s latest book. Are you striving so hard to find success that you’re playing the world’s game rather than fulfilling your core desires? If so, I encourage you to pull back and reflect on your life. Go on a spiritual retreat or start a journal. Better yet, engage a mentor, therapist, or close friend to dig deep into what’s most important to you.</p><p>This is hard work, as you peel back the layers of your inner self and learn to accept yourself fully, weaknesses and all. It means digging deeply into past wounds, failures, and disappointments, and discovering what you learned about yourself that can guide you going forward. To get started, think about the end of your life and hypothesize your granddaughter asking you, “What did you do to make a difference in the world?” What will you tell her?</p><p>The time to start acting on that is now, not then. Life beckons you. Don’t wait until it’s too late. You may discover that what’s missing in your life is not success, but significance. We only go around once in life, so we need to seek all the wonders it has to offer.</p><p>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of Discover Your True North.</p><hr><p>This article was originally published on&nbsp;<a style=\"color: #21759b; outline: none;\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/04/27/whats-your-life-goal-success-or-significance/\">Fortune</a>&nbsp;on 4/27/16.</p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/04/27/whats-your-life-goal-success-or-significance/\">Fortune</a>"

Iger would not consider himself an innovator in the class of Walt Disney or Steve Jobs, but he is a master at identifying, motivating, and supporting creative leaders.</p><p>Why are there so many innovators, but so few innovation leaders?</p><p>Today, there are tens of thousands of innovators, but few outstanding innovation leaders. Those companies with innovation leaders at their helm, like Google, Apple, Amazon, Gilead, Disney, 3M, Tesla, and my former company Medtronic, have sustained their growth and performed exceptionally well. Meanwhile, one-time innovation pioneers that lost their mojo (such as Hewlett-Packard) have stagnated.</p><p>Startups, smaller companies, and academic institutions currently drive most of our nation’s innovation. It doesn’t have to be this way. Companies like Google GOOGL -0.59% , 3M, Disney, and Apple show that corporations can stay creative even as they grow large. Many people call these companies “experts on innovation,” but the truth is a bit more nuanced. These organizations don’t just develop innovative ideas; they develop innovation leaders.</p><p>Before Iger became CEO of Disney, his predecessor used a disciplined, “factory-like” process to produce films. Business development teams came up with ideas and then handed them to directors. Iger rearranged the process, placing faith in his creative directors and enabling them to propose original ideas.</p><p>Iger isn’t the only leader at Disney inspiring creativity. Disney subsidiary Pixar has two of the world’s finest innovation leaders in Ed Catmull and John Lasseter. Thanks to their leadership, Pixar has created the 12 most successful animated films of all time, including the 2016 Oscar winner, “Inside Out.” After he was fired from Apple AAPL 1.03% , Steve Jobs bought controlling interest in Pixar, and he learned first-hand from Catmull and Lasseter how to lead innovators. This experience paved the way for Jobs’ string of successes when he returned to Apple in 1997.</p><p>During a corporate board trip I took in 2013 to Pixar with Iger, Catmull, and Lasseter and learned first-hand why they are so successful. We visited their teams—the first-line innovators that create Pixar films – and saw how these innovation leaders interacted with them. Catmull said that as part of the merger, Iger asked him and Lasseter to take over Disney Studios because it had become bureaucratic and slow-moving. In turn, they revived its fortunes – a success which was evident in the popular 2013 film, “Frozen.” Iger didn’t stop with Pixar, though. He later bought Lucasfilm and Marvel Entertainment, and retained their innovation leaders.</p><p>Examining Alphabet (nee Google), we see the same caliber of leaders. The former CEOs of Nest, Genentech, and Bloomberg all work for Alphabet. They operate within a common corporate framework because CEO Larry Page, who is himself a great innovation leader, gives them the latitude, resouces, and teams to engage in highly risky projects.</p><p>So, what are the key qualities of innovation leaders? What makes them so effective at bringing out the creativity in others? After all, the characteristics of great innovation leaders are dramatically different from traditional business managers. The following seven elements are the key ingredients to innovation leadership.</p><p><strong>Passion for innovation.</strong>&nbsp;Innovation leaders not only have to appreciate the benefits of innovation, they need a deep passion for innovations that benefit customers. Just approving funds for innovation is insufficient. Leaders must make innovation an essential part of the company’s culture and growth strategy.</p><strong>Passion for innovation.</strong><p><strong>A long-term perspective.</strong>&nbsp;Most investors think three years is “long-term,” but that won’t yield genuine innovation. Major innovations can change entire markets as the iPod and iTunes did, but they take time to perfect products and gain adoption by mainstream users. Thus innovation leaders are sometimes willing to sacrifice near-term financial results to seize longer-term opportunities.</p><strong>A long-term perspective.</strong><p>Companies like Apple and Alphabet find ways to shield their leaders from the day-to-day demands of investors. Google’s “X” runs the moonshot projects of Alphabet, which include driverless cars, drone delivery, and robotics. The division doesn’t measure its success by dollars created. Instead, it focuses on “speed of failure.” By changing the metrics of success, Page and co-founder Sergey Brin are able to balance fiscal discipline with the need to give innovation leaders a safe space to incubate new ideas.</p><p><strong>The courage to fail and learn from failure.</strong>&nbsp;The risks of innovation are well known, but many leaders aren’t willing to be associated with its failures. However, there is a great deal to be learned from why an innovation has failed, as this enhanced understanding can lead to the greatest breakthroughs. At Medtronic MDT 1.23% , our failures with implantable defibrillators in the 1980s led to far more sophisticated approaches to treating heart disease in the 1990s.</p><strong>The courage to fail and learn from failure.</strong><p><strong>Deep engagement with the innovators.</strong>&nbsp;Innovation leaders must be highly engaged with their teams, asking questions, probing for potential problems, and looking for ways to accelerate projects and broaden their impact. That’s what HP’s founders Bill Hewlett and David Packard did by wandering around HP’s labs and challenging innovators. My HBS colleague Amy Edmondson says groups where members can air wild ideas are “psychologically safe.” In such settings, participants feel respected even when their ideas are rejected, and they don’t fear airing opposing views. The more failed ideas that come up, they more likely the group will land on a successful one.</p><strong>Deep engagement with the innovators.</strong><p><strong>Willingness to tolerate mavericks and protect them from middle management.</strong>&nbsp;The best innovators are rule-breakers who don’t fit the corporate mold. These people are often threatening to middle managers, many of whom adhere to standard practices. That’s why innovation leaders must protect their mavericks’ projects, budgets, and careers rather than forcing them into traditional management positions.</p><strong>Willingness to tolerate mavericks and protect them from middle management.</strong><p><strong>Opening up time for creativity and brainstorming.</strong>&nbsp;Innovation leaders understand how to give their people the time to think—the difference between “maker time” and “manager time.” As Paul Graham wrote, managers break up their time into 30- to 60-minute chunks, feeling satisfied with tight schedules of meetings throughout the day. For makers, this is disruptive, because it is impossible to generate the time and freedom to be creative. Innovative thinkers need a few consecutive hours to enter “flow” – a mental state in which people are fully immersed in the creative process. Innovation leaders fit meetings around the needs of their creative teams. For instance, Steve Jobs held three-hour meetings on marketing – an unusual amount of time in a CEO’s schedule.</p><strong>Opening up time for creativity and brainstorming.</strong><p><strong>Being self-aware and mindful.</strong>&nbsp;The best innovation leaders understand the importance of self-awareness. Without knowing their limitations, they’ll be unable to bring out the strengths of those around them. Honest feedback is often hard to get because many people tell leaders what they want to hear rather than the unvarnished truth. For this reason, many leaders use 360-feedback from their peers and subordinates.</p><strong>Being self-aware and mindful.</strong><p>Mindful practices such as daily meditation, prayer, journaling, or jogging also helps leaders to be more creative and open to new ideas. For Iger, this means waking up every morning at 4:30 a.m. to be alone. For Jobs, this meant Zen Buddhist meditation. As I have learned from my personal practice of meditation, mindfulness helps me reflect on myself and my ability to lead others. Many of my strongest ideas have come from meditation.</p><p>Innovation leaders don’t create innovations themselves, but they are effective at leading creative people. While many companies claim they are innovative, few successfully develop leaders who understand how to lead creative teams. Many large companies often stifle innovation leaders. Short-term pressures, zero-sum success, and an unhealthy focus on the status quo all prevent innovation leaders from emerging.</p><p>Iger calls creativity “the heart and soul of Disney,” but, in truth, innovation leaders are at the core of every creative company. Without their leadership, companies begin to manage for short-term results and eventually decline. To stay ahead of their competitors, companies must have innovation leaders who inspire the creativity of others.</p><p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of Discover Your True North.</em></p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of Discover Your True North.</em><hr size=\"1\"><p><em>This article was originally published by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/04/04/the-leadership-quality-that-truly-separates-disneys-bob-iger-from-his-peers/\">Fortune.com</a>&nbsp;on 4/4/16.</em></p><em>This article was originally published by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/04/04/the-leadership-quality-that-truly-separates-disneys-bob-iger-from-his-peers/\">Fortune.com</a>&nbsp;on 4/4/16.</em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/04/04/the-leadership-quality-that-truly-separates-disneys-bob-iger-from-his-peers/\">Fortune.com</a>"

      "<p><strong>Weak leaders focus on all the things that are going wrong. Great ones bring out the best in us.</strong></p><strong>Weak leaders focus on all the things that are going wrong. Great ones bring out the best in us.</strong><p>Much that is written about leaders these days seems to be negative: they are incompetent, arrogant, unethical, greedy, the list goes on and on.</p><p>No doubt, there is a great deal of anger and cynicism from employees, shareholders, and voters. When things go wrong in our lives, we are quick to place the blame for our ills on our leaders, and we often expect our leaders to fix things.</p><p>Are we justified in doing so? Or are we externalizing our problems by blaming those in charge? Is it time to accept responsibility for our lives and take action to make things better?</p><p>We live in an imperfect world, filled with violence, income inequality, a lack of jobs, corruption, ill health, and defective products. As much as we would like to eradicate these ills, there are no easy solutions that leaders can apply to make such problems disappear.</p><p>Meanwhile, political leaders are fanning the flames of anger and distrust in order to gain popular support. Their words are intensified by the 24-hour news cycle, with every outlet looking to gain viewers by highlighting the urgency of these ills.</p><p>This atmosphere brings out the worst in us. All we are doing is further dividing the country between rich and poor, conservatives and liberals, free traders and protectionists, hawks and doves. The next American president will be no more able to eliminate these problems than the last two have been. And blaming the media doesn’t solve anything because their incentive structure is built on giving people stories they want to grow the size of their audience.</p><p>In business, activist investors assault corporate boards with simplistic, short-term solutions to break up companies, leverage their balance sheets, or buy back stock by cutting investment required for their strategic success. These investors can find something to criticize at every company. And shareholders often give them the benefit of the doubt in order to see near-term bumps in stock prices.</p><p>But toxic leadership comes at a great cost. Such leaders create environments that bring out the worst in people and drag everyone down. Like malignant tumors, negative attitudes spread throughout organizations until everyone is playing “the blame game” and avoiding responsibility for the problems they create. Once this happens, organizations are on a path to self-destruction, creating in their wake enormous harm for employees and shareholders alike. At this point, the organization is no longer able to sustain itself and begins to unravel. That’s what happened to Sears, General Motors, Lehman Brothers, Kodak, and other victims of politics, cynicism, and short-term thinking.</p><p><strong>Enter Positive Leadership</strong></p><strong>Enter Positive Leadership</strong><p>Authentic leaders, by contrast, try to bring out the best in people. They aim to see others’ potential, to empower people to take responsibility for their actions, and to work together to make things better for all people. That’s what great political leaders like Ronald Reagan, Franklin D. Roosevelt, and Nelson Mandela have done in years past. It is what today’s leaders in business, health care, nonprofits, academia, and yes – in politics – need to do to bring us together to make life better for all people and to ameliorate our ills.</p><p>Sustainable, meaningful progress of any kind comes with a multitude of trials and tribulations. Yet the best leaders find ways to celebrate the incremental victories. As I highlight in my latest book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/\"><em>Discover Your True North</em></a>, recent scientific research shows that positive approaches to empower people is a&nbsp;<em>must-have&nbsp;</em>leadership trait. By and large, the leaders I know are doing just that. They are doing their best to encourage people to grow, contribute, and live happy and meaningful lives. To use the words of author Adam Grant, they are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/04/in-the-company-of-givers-and-takers\">“givers,” not “takers.”</a></p><a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/\"><em>Discover Your True North</em></a><em>Discover Your True North</em><em>must-have&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2013/04/in-the-company-of-givers-and-takers\">“givers,” not “takers.”</a><p>This approach is consistent with the positive psychology movement pioneered by psychologist Martin Seligman. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/martin_seligman_on_the_state_of_psychology\">three aims of positive psychology</a>&nbsp;are:</p><a href=\"https://www.ted.com/talks/martin_seligman_on_the_state_of_psychology\">three aims of positive psychology</a><ol>\n<li>Building human strength</li>\n<li>Making the lives of people fulfilling</li>\n<li>Nurturing the talent that resides in all of us</li>\n</ol><li>Building human strength</li><li>Making the lives of people fulfilling</li><li>Nurturing the talent that resides in all of us</li><p>In his book&nbsp;<em>Focus,&nbsp;</em>Daniel Goleman describes multiple experiments that demonstrate the impact of positive interactions with employees. One experiment showed employees perceived negative feedback more favorably when it was delivered in warm, supportive tones. When good news or positive feedback was delivered in negative tones, employees left the discussions feeling poorly, instead of feeling elated by their successes. Seligman’s research shows a 3:1 “positive-to-negative” statements ratio is necessary for healthy professional relationships.</p><em>Focus,&nbsp;</em><p>When organizations hit roadblocks, people naturally get upset, and often their anger shows, but that doesn’t resolve anything. As&nbsp;<em>Positive Intelligence&nbsp;</em>author Shirzad Chamine says, there is an inner, often unconscious dialogue going on between your&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.positiveintelligence.com/assessments/\">“sage” and your “saboteurs.”</a>&nbsp;As leaders recognize this dialogue, they will be alert to avoiding negative responses that sabotage healthy relationships. By inquiring rather than directing, leaders can find opportunities within the challenges their organizations face. They also can build better relationships with colleagues who count on them to help solve problems.</p><em>Positive Intelligence&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.positiveintelligence.com/assessments/\">“sage” and your “saboteurs.”</a><p><strong>Alan Mulally’s Positive Transformation at Ford</strong></p><strong>Alan Mulally’s Positive Transformation at Ford</strong><p>Navigating severe challenges requires strong, courageous, and authentic leaders. That’s what Alan Mulally offered at Ford Motor&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/ford-motor-9/\">F</a>&nbsp;0.37%&nbsp;.</p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/ford-motor-9/\">F</a><p>On his first day as Ford’s CEO in 2006, Mulally asked to tour Ford’s famous Rouge plant where Henry Ford created the Model T. Mulally was informed by one of his top executives, “Our leaders don’t talk directly to factory employees.” Ignoring that advice, he went to the plant immediately to talk to front-line workers.</p><p>Mullaly also set up mandatory weekly management meetings he called the business process review (BPR) for his top executives to get to the root cause of Ford’s long-standing problems. He quickly discovered that Ford’s challenges went way beyond financial losses: the culture at Ford was broken and in need of massive transformation. He observed, “Ford had been going out of business for 40 years, and no one would face that reality.”</p><p>In response, Mulally developed&nbsp;<a href=\"http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2013-14/blueprint-strategy.html\">One Ford</a>, an initiative based on “focus, teamwork and a single global approach, aligning employee efforts toward a common definition of success.” He started by redesigning internal meetings. As described in Bryce Hoffman’s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204781804577269410217101038\"><em>American Icon</em></a>, meetings had become “arenas for mortal combat” in which employees practiced self-preservation, trying to identify flaws in each other’s plans instead of recommending solutions to their problems.</p><a href=\"http://corporate.ford.com/microsites/sustainability-report-2013-14/blueprint-strategy.html\">One Ford</a><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970204781804577269410217101038\"><em>American Icon</em></a><em>American Icon</em><p>Mulally reframed these meetings from negative to positive, fostering a safe environment where people had open and honest discussions without fear of blame. Instead of attacking executives for the issues they brought to the table, Mulally encouraged collaborative approaches to problem solving. He noted, “If you have a common purpose and an environment in which people want to help others succeed, the problems will be fixed quickly.”</p><p>Mulally introduced a “traffic light” system to weekly BPRs in which executives indicated progress on key initiatives as green, yellow, or red. After four meetings in which all programs were labelled green, Mulally confronted his team, “We are going to lose $18 billion this year, so is there anything that’s not going well?” His question was met with stony silence.</p><p>The following week, Ford’s North American President, Mark Fields, showed a red indicator that a new vehicle launch would be delayed. Other executives assumed Fields would be fired over the bad news. Instead, Mulally began clapping and said, “Mark, that is great visibility.” He asked the group, “What can we do to help Mark out?” As he frequently told his leaders, “You&nbsp;<em>have</em>&nbsp;a problem;&nbsp;<em>you</em>&nbsp;are not the problem.”</p><em>have</em><em>you</em><p>Mulally describes his leadership style as “<a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/leading-in-the-21st-century-an-interview-with-fords-alan-mulally\">positive leadership</a>—conveying the idea that there is always a way forward.” He says a critical part of positive leadership is “reinforcing the idea that everyone is included. When people feel accountable and included, it is more fun. It is just more rewarding to do things in a supportive environment.”</p><a href=\"http://www.mckinsey.com/business-functions/strategy-and-corporate-finance/our-insights/leading-in-the-21st-century-an-interview-with-fords-alan-mulally\">positive leadership</a><p>With determination and positive leadership, Mulally created a culture of effective problem solving and teamwork. As a result, his team kept Ford out of bankruptcy, reversed market share losses with improved auto designs and quality, brought jobs back to the U.S. from overseas plants, and restored the company’s profitability by becoming cost competitive with foreign producers.</p><p>Weak leaders focus on all the things that are going wrong. Great leaders like Mulally bring out the best in us. The most effective leaders apply the principles of positive psychology, ensuring their interactions with employees contain a healthy balance of positive and constructive feedback. They maintain an optimistic outlook despite the setbacks, reinforcing that there is a hopeful way forward.</p><p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of&nbsp;</em>Discover Your True North.</p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of&nbsp;</em><hr size=\"1\"><p><em>This article was originally posted on 3/21/2015 on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/03/21/negative-positive-leadership-politics-ford-alan-mulally/\">Fortune.com</a>.</em></p><em>This article was originally posted on 3/21/2015 on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/03/21/negative-positive-leadership-politics-ford-alan-mulally/\">Fortune.com</a>.</em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/03/21/negative-positive-leadership-politics-ford-alan-mulally/\">Fortune.com</a>"

      "<p>During the past year I have been a consistent critic of activist investors seeking to take over or influence well-run companies including Apple, PepsiCo, Amgen, DuPont, Dow, eBay and Allergan. However, I have supported activists who have challenged moribund management teams backed by complacent boards of directors.</p><p>The new challenge to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/UAL\" target=\"_blank\">United-Continental Holdings</a>, known as United Airlines, fits the latter description perfectly. United deserves to be challenged. This week, PAR Capital and Altimeter Capital, two hedge funds with years of experience investing in the airline and transportation industries, have assembled 7.1 percent of United’s shares and seek to name six board members.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/UAL\" target=\"_blank\">United-Continental Holdings</a><p>Leading their charge is none other than Gordon Bethune, the successful former chairman and CEO of Continental (1994-2004) and career veteran of the airline industry.</p><p>Bethune, in an appearance on CNBC this week, criticized the airline’s performance and lack of airline experience on its board and in its executive leadership.</p><p>“The current board has a country club atmosphere,” Bethune said.</p><p>Having Bethune at the helm would be a refreshing change for United’s leadership, which has been non-existent since CEO Oscar Munoz’s heart attack in October and subsequent heart transplant. Prior to Munoz’s appointment last September, the board ousted former CEO Jeff Smisek who had created “the chairman’s flight” to South Carolina to win favor with the chief regulator of the Newark International Airport in order to gain concessions for United.</p><p>United’s troubles existed long before Smisek’s termination. The 2010 merger with Continental was plagued by poor integration, battles with its unions and computer problems that led to persistent delays, missing luggage, and poor customer service. Its first-line employees were angry at how they were being treated, and their attitudes impacted United’s passengers. According to the Bureau of Transportation statistics, over one-quarter of its flights arrived late last year – by an average of 65 minutes! That was well above other airlines, including<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/DAL\" target=\"_blank\">Delta</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/AAL\" target=\"_blank\">American</a>.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/DAL\" target=\"_blank\">Delta</a><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/AAL\" target=\"_blank\">American</a><p>The contrast is marked between United’s woeful performance and the stunning leadership of Richard Anderson, Chairman and CEO of Delta Airlines. Anderson is an airline industry veteran who revived the former Northwest Airlines as its CEO, before a brief sojourn as executive vice president of United Health Group. Anderson became Delta’s CEO in 2007 to lead it out of its 2005 bankruptcy. The following year he merged Delta with Northwest, which had also gone through bankruptcy, and quickly created a unified culture, sound relations with the pilot’s union, and an integrated route structure. He took the unusual step of changing ID numbers on employee security badge to erase any identification with Northwest or the old Delta.</p><p>Anderson is a hands-on leader who meets regularly with employees and is often found on the flight line talking with the maintenance crew or in the cockpit jump seat chatting with pilots. He eliminated the bottlenecks in flights by boarding passengers forty minutes early, ensuring minimal lost baggage, and enabling many flights to arrive early – all of which have led to high levels of customer and employee satisfaction. Since the 2008-09 recession, Delta has experienced strong profitability and is using its cash flow to invest in updated aircraft and improvements to in-flight customer service.</p><p>As a frequent flyer on Delta and a reluctant passenger on United, my experiences with the two airlines differ dramatically. It is a pleasure to fly Delta where the pilots and flight attendants seem to genuinely enjoy flying and serving passengers. Delta is so efficient that I have come to expect to arrive early, and walk away feeling very satisfied. In contrast, the morale at United seems low. Do employees care whether the flight arrives on time or not? In a way, you cannot blame them as their systems are so poor that flight delays are inevitable.</p><p>Thus, United is a perfect target for an activist takeover that could benefit from a board and leadership team of airline veterans. Who better than Bethune to lead the transformation? For the sake of United’s passengers and employees, this is one battle the activists deserve to win.</p><hr size=\"1\"><p><em>This article was originally posted to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/09/time-for-a-shake-up-at-united-airlines-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a>&nbsp;on 3/9/2016.</em></p><em>This article was originally posted to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/09/time-for-a-shake-up-at-united-airlines-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a>&nbsp;on 3/9/2016.</em><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2016/03/09/time-for-a-shake-up-at-united-airlines-commentary.html\">CNBC.com</a><div></div>"

      "<p>Listening to the media these days one would think that our leaders have lost all sense of humility, if indeed they ever had it.</p><p>Donald Trump brags that he used a $1 million inheritance to create $10 billion net worth. CEOs like Valeant’s Mike Pearson hype their quarterly results by focusing only on the positive aspects, only to see their company’s stock prices collapse at a later date. Activist investors like Carl Icahn and Nelson Peltz act like they understand complex businesses better than experienced leaders with decades of experiences. Then they use media appearances and public pronouncements to bully CEOs and their boards into “quick fix” solutions.</p><p>Whatever happened to humility as a virtue for leaders?</p><p>In his 2005 <em>Harvard Business Review</em> <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2005/07/level-5-leadership-the-triumph-of-humility-and-fierce-resolve\">article</a>, author Jim Collins postulated a higher level of leader characterized by humility and fierce resolve. This indeed corresponds with my experience: the finest leaders are keenly aware of their limitations and the importance of teams around them in creating their success.</p><em>Harvard Business Review</em><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2005/07/level-5-leadership-the-triumph-of-humility-and-fierce-resolve\">article</a><p>They know they stand on the shoulders of giants who built their institutions. Their job is to build teams of leaders capable of taking their organization to higher levels in order to cope with today’s fierce demands. They exhibit humility in their actions and interactions, yet are passionately committed to the success of their enterprises.&nbsp;</p><p>The word humility is often misunderstood. Dictionaries define it as “a modest opinion of one’s own importance,” “the quality of not thinking you are better than other people,” and “self-restraint from excessive vanity.” It is certainly not false modesty or disavowing one’s accomplishments.</p><p>Humility derives from an inner sense of self-worth. Humble leaders are grounded by their beliefs, their values, and the principles by which they lead. Ultimately, they know to lead is to serve their customers, employees, investors, communities, and ultimately, society through their work.</p><p>Humility is an essential quality for authentic leaders. People trust them because they know they are genuine, honest, and sincere. Lacking those qualities, people live in fear and doubt – not exactly the ingredients to bring out the best in people. In difficult times, people rely on humble leaders even more to get them through crises.</p><p>Every day leaders are closely scrutinized for their words and their actions, as they become role models for people inside and outside their organizations. In contrast, leaders who brag and tout their achievements often do so from a deep sense of insecurity. Outwardly, they act like bullies and try to intimidate people, but inside they feel like imposters who may be unmasked at any time.</p><p>This is not to suggest that humble leaders are soft, weak, or unwilling to take tough actions such as terminating poor performers or laying people off.&nbsp; They do so with clarity about the impact of their actions, not for themselves but for the greater good of their organizations.</p><p>For much of my life, no one would have considered me humble. To the contrary, I felt the need to push myself forward through my accomplishments, to be recognized for my achievements, and to express confidence that I could solve any problem presented to me. In part, these characteristics stemmed from fear of being rejected by others or bullied by powerful personalities. In my early years it was hard to admit my mistakes without rationalizing them or to say simply, “I don’t know.”</p><p>As my inner confidence grew, I no longer needed to have all the answers or try to impress others with what I had done. I freely admitted my mistakes, and learned that doing so enabled others to acknowledge their errors. I recognized vulnerability is power, not trying to appear invulnerable. As I did so, people gained greater confidence in my leadership and expressed increased desire to join me in common pursuits.&nbsp;</p><p>I still don’t like bullies, and want to challenge them, rather than let them get away with intimidating others. When I witness them trying to overpower others, I defend people against them. At least now I confront them with facts and rational arguments, not emotional responses.</p><p>Ultimately, we connect with others not through our words, our intellect, or having the right answer, but through our hearts – our humility in the challenges we face, missteps we have made, our weaknesses, and our acceptance of not knowing. As the Bible says, “With pride comes disgrace, but with humility comes wisdom” (Proverbs 11:2). This is the wisdom of experience tempered by judgment.</p>"

Bill Ackman graced the cover of Forbes with the moniker “Baby Buffett.” Nelson Peltz headlined big conferences. CNBC held off its commercial breaks when Carl Icahn called in.</span><p>In recent weeks, however, the activist movement appears to have peaked. Investors who entrust their money to activists do so for one simple reason: they anticipate higher returns than they obtain from index funds. After all, why would they pay activists a flat 2% management fee plus 20% on their gains, when they can invest in Vanguard index funds for only 0.15%?</p><p>The performance of activist funds in 2015 and January 2016 was anything but impressive. During 2015, activist targeted stocks declined 8%, compared to gains of 1.4% for the S&amp;P 500. And in January, activist funds declined an additional 6.1%. These results are causing investors to reconsider investing in activists and voting with them in proxy fights.</p><h2>Rise of the Activists</h2><p>During 2014 and 2015, the prominence of activists exploded. More than 200 American companies were publicly subjected to demands from activist investors in the first half of 2015 and approximately two-thirds of those demands were successful. The win rate of activists battling for a seat on a company’s board rose from 52% in 2012 to 73% in 2014. And within 18 months after an activist investor joined their board, 44% of companies replaced their CEOs.</p><p>Activists posted strong returns from 2012 to 2014, buoyed by the S&amp;P’s post-recession performance. Activist funds gained 9.3% in 2012, 19.2% in 2013, and 8.5% in 2014, compared to -0.5%, 15.8%, and 2.1 % for the S&amp;P 500 Index. Activist coffers swelled from $23 billion in 2002 to $166 billion in 2014. Some activists like Icahn have even taken relatively inactive positions in well-managed, large companies like General Electric, a move that makes “activist investing” sound more like stock picking with very high fees than a balanced investment strategy.</p><p>Activists recorded some big wins in the last two years in struggles with major companies like DuPont, Dow, Procter &amp; Gamble, eBay, and Microsoft. Their influence grew as they toppled leading CEOs like Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer and P&amp;G’s Bob McDonald. Icahn was even able to pressure mighty Apple to let go of part of its enormous cash hoard by buying back $140 billion of its stock.</p><p>At the end of 2015, activist Nelson Peltz recorded one of his biggest “wins,” just six months after he lost a hard-fought proxy contest to DuPont CEO Ellen Kullman. After DuPont DD -1.04% beat the market by 100% during Kullman’s first six years, the company reported two weak quarters, largely on account of factors that affected all commodity producers: China’s slump, collapsing commodity prices, weak agricultural markets, and negative currency comparisons. The company’s stock price dropped nearly 30%, and Peltz’s team renewed its pressure on DuPont’s board.</p><p>Ed Breen, who joined DuPont’s board in January, and the company’s other board members relented. Kullman resigned under pressure, and Breen became DuPont’s new CEO. During his first month on the job, Breen accepted Dow CEO Andrew Liveris’ proposal to merge DuPont with Dow and then split the combined business into three smaller companies. They were following the activist’s script to near perfection.</p><p>Liveris himself was under pressure from another activist investor, Dan Loeb’s Third Point. Just a year before, Liveris agreed with Loeb to add four new board members in exchange for a standstill in the activist pressure. Liveris and Breen announced their plan just two days before that détente was set to expire. Loeb was furious that he was not consulted about the deal, and he called for Liveris’ immediate resignation.</p><p>Anticipating short-term results, DuPont and Dow DOW -0.88% stocks both jumped 12% with the announcement. But the euphoria didn’t last. Investors questioned the validity of the merger and subsequent three-way breakup, causing both stocks to drop 22% since then, more than 10% below their pre-merger levels. After their complex restructuring is completed, the three baby DuPont-Dows will struggle to keep up with global giants like Germany’s BASF and China’s Sinopec. And DuPont is closing its corporate research center that invented nylon, Teflon, and solar cells in favor of near-term product development, all while BASF invests €1.88 billion annually in R&amp;D.</p><p>By the end of 2015, the lessons learned from DuPont-Dow were causing leading law firms to recommend settlement with activist investors rather than risk costly proxy fights. AIG AIG -1.42% was the most recent to react, adding board members from Carl Icahn’s team and investor John Paulson himself, in order to avoid a break-up following a losing quarter.</p><h2>Wither the Activist Movement?</h2><p>The veneer of invincibility is wearing off for activists. “Investing King” Carl Icahn has lost money on bets, as Hertz HTZ 0.82% and Chesapeake Energy’s CHK 5.32% shareholder return fell 43% and 39%, respectively, since his interventions. Bill Ackman’s firm, Pershing Square Holdings, reported a 20.5% dip in 2015, its worst performance in 11 years, and has slid an additional 18% in early 2016.</p><p>Activists are currently facing the true test for any investor in a volatile, even declining, market: can they create value for investors while avoiding big pitfalls? In spite of their billionaire status, outsize egos, and media images, activists do not have investing superpowers. Instead, they have taken advantage of a simple strategy: buying volatile stocks in a rising bull market. Activists learned to avoid troubled companies and instead invested in high performers like PepsiCo, eBay, Apple, and Allergan. Then they focus on short-term financial “fixes” such as stock buybacks or splitting a company.</p><p>That’s what happened to Kraft when Peltz pressured CEO Irene Rosenfeld to break the global company into a North American company retaining the name Kraft and an international company named Mondelez MDLZ 0.38% , based in Chicago and run by Rosenfeld. The financial engineering created short-term value for shareholders, but Mondelez has since been in a period of malaise. Meanwhile, Kraft collapsed due to a lack of leadership, fled into the arms of Brazilian investment firm 3G, and was merged into Heinz. Unsurprisingly, the Brazilians are looking to cut costs at Kraft by 40%, as its revenues fall sharply. Ackman has recently joined the fray, recommending Mondelez also be merged into Kraft-Heinz.</p><h2>The Real Activist Strategy and Results</h2><p>Activists often act like they understand their target’s business better than its managers, charging in with MBA-like presentations. While a company’s stock price frequently rises when an activist buys minor fractions of its stock, their recommended moves often fail to create sustainable shareholder value. By this time, however, it’s hard to put a company back on course.</p><p>Activist investors are outsiders who are focused too much on stock analysis and too little on understanding the strategy and culture of organizations. Meanwhile, they often hurt company performance by forcing the abandonment of investments in long-term initiatives like research and development (R&amp;D) and capital expenditures. For all their brilliance, they are in no position to make deep qualitative judgments about a company’s R&amp;D pipeline, quality of innovation, and cultures.</p><p>Activist investors frequently bail out once they are able to increase the share price of a company through financial engineering. This will ultimately hurt America’s competitiveness. Since 2010, the 1,900 companies that repurchased their shares allocated an average 113% of their capital spending to buybacks and dividends, compared to only 60% in 2000. Previously, these funds were spent on innovation, R&amp;amamp;D, and marketing. Underneath the façade of inflated share prices are underinvested assets.</p><h2>Pushing Back</h2><p>Despite the significant media attention devoted to activists, their overall long-term financial impact remains unclear. An October 2015 review of activist investors by the Wall Street Journal concluded, “Activism often improves a company’s operational results—and nearly as often doesn’t.” That’s based on short-term measures, not the ability of the company to compete through 10 to 20-year business cycles and emerge on top.</p><p>CEO Larry Fink, whose BlackRock funds have more than $4 trillion in assets under management, recently sent another one of his powerful letters to S&amp;P 500 CEOs, warning them about favoring financial engineering over sound strategy and management. He argued:</p><p>“Many companies continue to engage in practices that may undermine their ability to invest for the future. Dividends paid out by S&amp;P 500 companies in 2015 amounted to the highest proportion of their earnings since 2009. As of the end of the third quarter of 2015, buybacks were up 27% over 12 months…. We are asking that every CEO lay out for shareholders each year a strategic framework for long-term value creation. Today’s culture of quarterly earnings hysteria is totally contrary to the long-term approach we need.”</p><p>Trust is the foundation of American capitalism. Unfortunately, many activist investors have damaged that faith. The staying power of activists will depend on whether they are able to regain our confidence through sustained financial performance, heightened innovation, and greater long-term investments, not just immediate gains.</p><p>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, former Chairman &amp; CEO of Medtronic, and author of Discover Your True North.</p><hr><p>This article was originally published 02/18/16 on&nbsp;<a style=\"color: #21759b; outline: none;\" href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/02/18/activist-investors-losing-luster/\">Fortune.com</a>.</p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/02/18/activist-investors-losing-luster/\">Fortune.com</a>"

      "<p><strong>AMERICA’S PHILANTHROPISTS AREN’T WAITING ANY LONGER FOR POLITICIANS OR BUSINESSES TO SOLVE THE WORLD’S MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS.</strong></p><strong>AMERICA’S PHILANTHROPISTS AREN’T WAITING ANY LONGER FOR POLITICIANS OR BUSINESSES TO SOLVE THE WORLD’S MOST PRESSING PROBLEMS.</strong><p>To those optimistic, persistent souls who have a vested interest in seeing positive social change&nbsp;in the U.S., here’s a sobering message: if you are looking for meaningful government support, don’t hold your breath.</p><p>Political gridlock and mounting federal debt have effectively rendered the U.S. government impotent, robbing it of its historic ability to spur social change. Americans give Congress a miserable&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx\">11%</a>&nbsp;approval rating, and when the government does take action, it seems to bungle the job. President Obama’s Affordable Care Act promised to transform health care. After debacles in the rollout of the law, many Americans are accepting penalties versus buying insurance due to the increases in health insurance premiums. Meanwhile, rapid escalation of drug prices continues unabated.</p><a href=\"http://www.gallup.com/poll/1600/congress-public.aspx\">11%</a><p>Can business step into the void and champion meaningful change?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Many companies are making important contributions, but CEOs have less leeway than ever to make bold investments in their communities. Due to growing pressures from short-term shareholders and increasing regulations, companies have been severely constrained in making targeted, long-term investments that drive social change.</p><p>America’s philanthropists aren’t waiting any longer for politicians or businesses to solve the world’s most pressing problems. They are committing massive amounts of their own money to solve the most difficult challenges in health, education, job creation, and the environment.</p><p>In doing so, they are elevating the importance of philanthropy in American society and across the world. By targeting their funds to achieve tangible results, philanthropists are demonstrating they are indeed “the passing gear of society.”</p><p>Following a long line of benefactors like Andrew Carnegie, John D. Rockefeller, and Henry Ford, Microsoft founder Bill Gates ignited the current philanthropic revolution. In 2000, he and his wife Melinda announced they were creating a foundation worth $44 billion—half his net worth. Inspired by Gates’ passion and effectiveness, his friend Warren Buffett announced in 2006 he would contribute $30 billion of Berkshire Hathaway stock and have it managed by the Gates Foundation. Since 2000, the Gates Foundation has given away $39 billion to eradicate diseases in developing countries, enable people to emerge from poverty, and improve K-12 education.</p><p>Bill and Melinda Gates are anything but “checkbook philanthropists.” They are&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/business/energy-environment/bill-gates-takes-on-climate-change-with-nudges-and-a-powerful-rolodex.html\">devoting the bulk of their time</a>&nbsp;traveling the world searching for opportunities to make a difference with their funds. Their focus on overcoming disease, improving education, and lobbying for climate change initiatives is having a powerful impact. They have also built an organization of 1,200 talented people who manage their grants.</p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/09/business/energy-environment/bill-gates-takes-on-climate-change-with-nudges-and-a-powerful-rolodex.html\">devoting the bulk of their time</a><p>In 2011, Gates and Buffett decided to recruit other philanthropists by launching “<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2010/06/16/the-600-billion-challenge/\">The Giving Pledge</a>.” By the end of 2015, they had persuaded 141 wealthy couples and individuals to give away at least 50% of their fortunes—a clear indication of the growing power of philanthropy.</p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2010/06/16/the-600-billion-challenge/\">The Giving Pledge</a><p>Their efforts have borne fruit in the case of Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife, Dr. Priscilla Chan. After giving $100 million to Newark, New Jersey schools,<a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/zuckerberg-wife-gift-120m-ca-schools\">$120 million</a>&nbsp;to Bay Area schools, and 18 million Facebook shares (now worth $1.9 billion) to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, they made the audacious announcement that they would give away 99% of their Facebook stock during their lifetime, an amount currently valued at $45 billion. They decided to make these contributions through a limited liability company (LLC) to have greater flexibility to make grants, lobby for causes, and invest in promising innovative ideas. If Facebook continues its remarkable growth, the ultimate value of the Zuckerbergs’ giving could easily exceed $100 billion.</p><a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/zuckerberg-wife-gift-120m-ca-schools\">$120 million</a><p>The Chan-Zuckerberg Initiative makes clear the dedication of Millennials to drive social change. Millennials have a deep passion for making a difference in the world and are focused on making a difference&nbsp;<em>throughout their lives</em>, rather than waiting until their death. At 31, Zuckerberg’s commitment comes at a much younger age than even Gates and Buffett. As he wrote in his inspiring letter to his newborn daughter, “We must make long term investments over 25, 50, or even 100 years.”</p><em>throughout their lives</em><p>In Zuckerberg’s case, it didn’t take long for the cynics to pounce. Because their investment vehicle is an LLC rather than 501(c)(3) foundation, writers like Jesse Eisinger in<em>The New York Times</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/business/dealbook/how-mark-zuckerbergs-altruism-helps-himself.html\">accused Zuckerberg of a public relations coup</a>, saying, “we are turning into a society of oligarchs.” Eisinger apparently fears the power of the wealthy to influence social change, as Rockefeller, Ford, and Carnegie did in the early 20th century.</p><em>The New York Times</em><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/12/04/business/dealbook/how-mark-zuckerbergs-altruism-helps-himself.html\">accused Zuckerberg of a public relations coup</a><p>Eisinger even had the audacity to assert that he could do a better job of distributing this money than Zuckerberg. Without a touch of humility, he wrote, “I think I might do a good job allocating $45 billion. Maybe even better than Zuckerberg.” Eisinger ignores one simple fact: it’s not his money.</p><p>Critics like Eisinger are missing a critical point. Rather than hoarding their money or creating family dynasties as many of their predecessors did, a growing number of wealthy Americans are pledging their fortunes to benefit society.</p><p>The critics argue the allocation of these funds is the proper role for government. As Eisinger wrote, “Society can’t rely on the beneficence and enlightenment of the super-wealthy. We need to take a portion uniformly—some kind of tax on wealth.”</p><p>This perspective is misguided. The technological and organizational genius of leaders like Gates and Zuckerberg can bring tremendous contributions to the improvement of social welfare. The critics’ apparent alternative—to redesign the U.S. tax system by instituting additional levies on income, capital gains, and estates—would inevitably backfire. They ignore the reality that excessively high tax rates would shut down the incentives that have made America the world’s most entrepreneurial nation—and also the most generous. Because European countries do not permit deductions for philanthropic gifts, philanthropy in those countries pales in comparison to charitable giving in America.</p><p>The magnitude of giving by these philanthropists marks a turning point in American society. Rather than criticizing leaders who are stepping up to help solve the most pressing problems of global society – devoting not just their money but their time as well – we should be venerating them. As a result of their remarkable generosity, philanthropy in 2016 is poised to stand alongside government and business as one of the most powerful forces influencing social change.</p><p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, author of&nbsp;Discover Your True North, and former Chairman and CEO of Medtronic</em></p><em>Bill George is Senior Fellow at Harvard Business School, author of&nbsp;Discover Your True North, and former Chairman and CEO of Medtronic</em><hr size=\"1\"><p><em>This article was originally posted to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/01/17/philanthropy-america-zuckerberg-gates/\">Fortune Magazine</a>&nbsp;on 1/17/2016</em></p><em>This article was originally posted to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/01/17/philanthropy-america-zuckerberg-gates/\">Fortune Magazine</a>&nbsp;on 1/17/2016</em><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2016/01/17/philanthropy-america-zuckerberg-gates/\">Fortune Magazine</a>"

Meanwhile, a generic version of the drug is available for $1.00.</p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/martin-shkreli/\">Martin Shkreli</a><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/21/martin-shkreli-fired-as-ceo-of-kalobios-pharmaceuticals.html\">former CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals</a><p>Shkreli proudly defended the price-gouging, unapologetically claiming his obligation was to serve investors. His extreme indifference to the patients whose lives are upended by his massive price hikes allowed the media to cast him as a “greed is good” Wall Street villain. His cavalier attitude may turn the full force of public opinion against the pharmaceutical industry, which is otherwise doing great work in treating and curing life-threatening diseases like cancer. Shkreli’s timing is ironic since it comes just as a new generation of breakthrough drugs is working its way through the arduous pharmaceutical trial process.</p><p>Shkreli got his 15 minutes in the spotlight last Thursday, but perhaps not the way he wanted. His photo in his gray hoodie was on the front page of every newspaper as he was led away by FBI agents. He was arrested for creating a quasi-Ponzi scheme by using money from<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/RTRX\">Retrophin</a>, a prior pharmaceutical company he started, to pay off losses in his hedge funds.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/RTRX\">Retrophin</a><p>Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/VRX-CA\">Valeant</a>, a legitimate company with a different business model, drew scrutiny for its own pricing by increasing prices 200 percent to 500 percent. As Cleveland Clinic CEO Toby Cosgrove&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/30/health-providers-pressured-by-insurance-drug-costs.html\">said on CNBC last month</a>, “We worked hard to reduce costs across the system by $10 million, and all our efforts got offset by price increases from Valeant totaling $11 million.”</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/VRX-CA\">Valeant</a><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/10/30/health-providers-pressured-by-insurance-drug-costs.html\">said on CNBC last month</a><p>Two years ago&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/GILD\">Gilead</a>&nbsp;caused an uproar when it announced its new Hepatitis C drug, Solvaldi, would cost $84,000 for a 12-week treatment, which put it out of reach of many patients. To its credit, Gilead spent billions to develop two breakthrough drugs, Solvaldi and a second Hepatitis C drug, Harvoni; together, they generated $14 billion in revenues in the first nine months of 2015.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/GILD\">Gilead</a><p>The latest round of drug-price increases have stirred up a public furor. As a result, the U.S. Senate Committee on Aging held hearings on these enormous increases on Dec. 9, during which senators from both parties<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/09/doctors-hospitals-condemn-out-of-control-drug-prices-as-senate-investigation-begins/\">denounced the unconscionable price increases</a>&nbsp;on decades-old drugs.</p><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/09/doctors-hospitals-condemn-out-of-control-drug-prices-as-senate-investigation-begins/\">denounced the unconscionable price increases</a><p>The pharmaceutical industry’s rationale that it needs high prices to afford the research has been turned on its head by Valeant’s business model of spending less than 3 percent on research &amp; development (R&amp;D) and paying less than 3 percent in taxes. Under CEO Mike Pearson’s leadership, Valeant attracted many investors and increased its stock-market value to more than $90 billion by last August. Since then, serious operating problems and questions about its business practices have contributed to a 60 percent share- price decline.</p><p>Pearson, a former management consultant, says 3 percent is sufficient because Valeant R&amp;D is much more efficient than the big pharmaceutical companies. As a longtime medical technology executive, I find this assertion preposterous, because no pharmaceutical company can create breakthrough drugs for just 3 percent of revenues. The most productive pharmaceutical companies such as&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/MRK\">Merck</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/LLY\">Eli Lilly</a>, and Roche, spend 17 percent to 24 percent on R&amp;D. They have deep internal expertise and take on scientific risk, rather than just acquiring small drugs and marketing them.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/MRK\">Merck</a><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/LLY\">Eli Lilly</a><p>As egregious as these price increases may be, they are just the tip of the iceberg. A much deeper problem threatens the financial viability of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/obamacare/\">Affordable Care Act (ACA), known as Obamacare</a>. When&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/barack-obama/\">President Obama</a>‘s former chief of staff Rahm Emanuel was putting together ACA back in 2009, he negotiated deals with leading pharmaceutical companies. For their support of ACA and $70 billion in payments to the federal government, the pharmaceutical industry obtained legal guarantees that the government could not negotiate drug prices. Now the chickens are coming home to roost for the government and private health plans as pharma makers regularly increase prices 6 percent to 10 percent — and many go far higher.</p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/obamacare/\">Affordable Care Act (ACA), known as Obamacare</a><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/barack-obama/\">President Obama</a><p>The pharmaceutical industry faces twin threats, just as the new generation of promising life-saving drugs is in final development. First, the entire industry is at risk of being vilified for not caring about patients. Second, the industry’s research-driven business model is under pressure from short-term investors arguing to abandon research in favor of simply acquiring drugs from start-ups. The pitfalls of price gouging are now being exposed, as are the consequences of simply buying drugs from others.</p><p>It’s time for the leaders of the pharmaceutical industry to speak out forcefully against these practices, and reaffirm their primary commitment to patients and research. That’s what Merck CEO Ken Frazier did at a recent Fortune conference,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/20/merck-ceo-drug-prices-turing/\">declaring</a>, “Turing is not the market. This is a hedge-fund guy masquerading as a pharma exec.” Frazier is following the mission established by founder George Merck, who declared, “Medicine is for the people. It is not for the profits.”</p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/11/20/merck-ceo-drug-prices-turing/\">declaring</a><p>All pharmaceutical companies should adopt that motto before the U.S. government, in response to public outrage, contravenes ACA to set strict price controls. Time is running short, and public patience is wearing thin.</p><hr size=\"1\"><p>This article was originally published on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/21/whats-behind-skyrocketing-drug-prices-commentary.html\">CNBC</a>&nbsp;on 12/21/15.</p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/12/21/whats-behind-skyrocketing-drug-prices-commentary.html\">CNBC</a>"

      "<p>From a young age I have understood the importance of giving. My father and mother instilled in me the practice of giving tithes, and I have stuck with that practice my entire life. Both of my&nbsp;parents were very involved in giving back – from local charities and organizations to the United Way and Rotary Club.</p><p>I believe that we must make a resolution to give back, however. It cannot be something that taught early but never executed. We must also be willing to donate our time in addition to our money.</p><p>Finally, it is critical that we prioritize the causes that we are truly passionate about.

      "<p>Shareholders are arguing that research takes too long, costs too much, and carries too many risks.</p><p>America’s vaunted research prowess is under attack. Not from China, Japan, or Germany, but from within, led by impatient investors eager to gain immediate boosts in stock prices.</p><p>Spurred on by activist investors, these shareholders are arguing that research takes too long, costs too much, and carries too many risks.</p><p>Unfortunately, that’s the very nature of research: despite efforts to accelerate innovation, basic research takes as long as ever because of the thoroughness, rigorous testing, and extended time required for commercialization. Consider the human genome. It was first sequenced during Bill Clinton’s presidency. Fifteen years later, biopharma companies are still working on early applications.</p><p>America’s corporate research labs, which have been working with academic research institutions supported by federal funding, have long been the envy of the world. Bell Labs, which produced many of the scientific breakthroughs of the 20th Century, has virtually disappeared as the result of mergers that left it owned by Nokia. I worked in research-based organizations for 35 years and witnessed first-hand the stunning breakthroughs that not only improved our lives but handsomely enriched long-term shareholders.</p><p>Now, DuPont’s research labs, which produced discoveries such as nylon, rayon, Teflon, and solar cells, is the target of persistent activist attacks. This week’s announcement of the merger of America’s two leading chemical companies, DuPont&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/dupont-87/\">DD</a>&nbsp;-5.07%&nbsp;and Dow&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/dow-chemical-48/\">DOW</a>&nbsp;-4.68%&nbsp;, could spell doom for DuPont’s central research labs and presages further research cuts at Dow as well. To preserve DuPont, former CEO Ellen Kullman won a hard-fought proxy contest with activist investor Nelson Peltz. Six months later, new board member Ed Breen convinced her to retire and took over as CEO.</p><a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/dupont-87/\">DD</a><a href=\"http://fortune.com/fortune500/dow-chemical-48/\">DOW</a><p>Only a month after taking the reins, Breen merged the company with Dow and will become CEO of the combined companies. Breen and Dow CEO Andrew Liveris have vowed to cut R&amp;D and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/dupont-and-dow-talks-put-spotlight-on-agricultural-industry-1449794667\">break the combined company into three smaller firms</a>, leaving it a weakened player in a competition against global chemical giants like Germany’s BASF and Bayer, and China’s Sinopec and Sinochem. Breen and Liveris were apparently reacting to pressure from activist investors including Peltz and Third Point’s Dan Loeb to resort to financial engineering to create immediate shareholder value. In doing so, they are pleasing short-term shareholders at the potential expense of business fundamentals.</p><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/dupont-and-dow-talks-put-spotlight-on-agricultural-industry-1449794667\">break the combined company into three smaller firms</a><p>These days, Wall Street cheers every time companies combine or break up and cut their R&amp;D. Buoyed by an unquenchable thirst for short-term stock gains, traders and activist investors are mounting pressure on a wide array of companies to cut research and capital expenditures in order to increase stock buybacks and thus boost stock prices. Activist investors love the “synergies” that result from dismantling R&amp;D. These actions cause short-term profits to rise, but what about a company’s future? Unfortunately, these investors don’t care. They cash in their profits long before a company’s prospects turn sour.</p><p>In pharmaceuticals, Pfizer has led the parade of R&amp;D cuts. It acquired Warner-Lambert, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn, and Wyeth, and then&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/exclusive-pfizer-once-again-cutting-back-research-staff/2015-02-24\">slashed their research budgets</a>&nbsp;by consolidating them. When Pfizer CEO Ian Read began his tenure in 2010, he vowed to make even more R&amp;D cuts and focus on purchasing drugs from others. As this strategy fizzled and British authorities declined Pfizer’s hostile takeover of Astra-Zeneca, Read turned not to drug development but to financial engineering. He recently announced a tax inversion deal to acquire Ireland-based Allergen. Inevitably, R&amp;D will be the big loser here as well.</p><a href=\"http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/exclusive-pfizer-once-again-cutting-back-research-staff/2015-02-24\">slashed their research budgets</a><p>Meanwhile, aggressive smaller pharmaceutical companies like Valeant openly brag about how they spend less than 3% on R&amp;D and 3% on taxes. Their goal is to acquire larger pharma companies like Allergan and Shire by paying top dollar, and then raising prices on older drugs by 200% to 500% to generate the appearance of revenue growth.</p><p>Slashing R&amp;D isn’t limited to pharmaceutical companies. Food giant Kraft was dismantled by Peltz in 2012, leaving a weakened company to seek shelter in the arms of Brazil’s 3G and combine with venerable HJ Heinz. The outcome? 3G is slashing all budgets including R&amp;D, contributing to further revenue declines.</p><p>In the struggle between research to fuel growth and cutbacks for short-term gains, financial engineers have the upper hand today. While these financial machinations are pleasing short-term traders, the loser will be America’s superior research machine. As a consequence, the U.S. could lose its global edge in research and badly damage its innovative spirit.</p><p>The entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley, whose forte is not basic research but disruptive innovation, are the only ones left standing. Apple, Google, Amazon, and Facebook have all but thumbed their nose at short-term shareholders and continue to invest in research at very high rates. How? Often by keeping control with two classes of stock: voting shares for founders and original investors, and non-voting for everyone else. In the past, this was considered poor corporate governance. Today, it is a pragmatic way for companies like Apple and Google to invest billions in “moonshot” projects such as self-driving cars.</p><p>It does not look like the U.S. government is prepared to step in and fund research in Corporate America’s absence. Despite its success, the National Institutes of Health&nbsp;<a href=\"http://federalnewsradio.com/budget/2015/11/lawmakers-demand-higher-nih-funding-house-appropriations/\">has faced decreasing budgets</a>&nbsp;since 2003, as its purchasing power decreased 30%. Nor has the government invested significantly in developing new forms of renewable energy.</p><a href=\"http://federalnewsradio.com/budget/2015/11/lawmakers-demand-higher-nih-funding-house-appropriations/\">has faced decreasing budgets</a><p>Meanwhile, China is funding research at an unprecedented rate. Its universities churn out&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ncee.org/2014/05/statistic-of-the-month-engineering-and-science-degree-attainment-by-country/\">150% more scientists and engineers</a>&nbsp;than America produces. As great as America’s technological universities are, the U.S. is educating far more foreign students than immigration policies permit to stay and work here. Meanwhile, China is building, not dismantling, global champions in every industry to compete for world dominance of their respective fields.</p><a href=\"http://www.ncee.org/2014/05/statistic-of-the-month-engineering-and-science-degree-attainment-by-country/\">150% more scientists and engineers</a><p>Germany isn’t backing off, either. By concentrating on select industries – automobiles, machine tools, chemicals, and construction – German industry has become the envy of the world in its exporting ability despite its high labor costs.</p><p>Where does this leave the U.S.? Barring a change in direction, our industrial base will be gutted as we lose competitive capability on the global scale. Then we will become a nation dominated by financial services, information technology, and service industries. Because of this, we will continue to lose well-paying jobs, further hollowing out the middle class, and creating even greater income inequality.</p><p>America can do a lot better, but first we have to overcome our need for instant financial gratification and focus on the long-term.</p><p><em>Bill George is the author of&nbsp;Discover Your True North, senior fellow at Harvard Business School, and former chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic</em></p><em>Bill George is the author of&nbsp;Discover Your True North, senior fellow at Harvard Business School, and former chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic</em><div></div>"

      "<p>The cover of last January’s&nbsp;<em>Harvard Business Review</em>&nbsp;featured the subhead, “<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-authenticity-paradox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">When it’s OK to fake it till you make it</a>.”</p><em>Harvard Business Review</em><a href=\"https://hbr.org/2015/01/the-authenticity-paradox\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">When it’s OK to fake it till you make it</a><p>“Faking it” is the antithesis of authentic leadership. Following this advice is the most likely path to failure as a leader. You cannot act like a leader until you go through the hard steps of developing yourself from within.</p><p>With the visible failures of leaders who tried to fake it,&nbsp;people have developed sensitive “sniff tests” and can quickly identify who is authentic and who is not. If you fake leadership, people will be unwilling to follow your lead and will resent your attempts to exert power over them.</p><p>“IF YOU FAKE LEADERSHIP, PEOPLE WILL BE UNWILLING TO FOLLOW YOUR LEAD”</p><p>Developing as a leader is hard work. It is similar to the rigorous training and required experience that surgeons, musicians, or athletes must go through before excelling in their fields. Can you imagine doing brain surgery without proper training? Or playing the cello at Carnegie Hall or tennis at Wimbledon without years of training and practice?</p><p>Just as you cannot learn these skills solely in the classroom, leaders must undertake rigorous personal development and have multiple leadership experiences before they are prepared for major leadership assignments. Through these processes, they learn about themselves and how to lead diverse people through complex challenges.</p><p>Look at the sad case of Theranos CEO Elizabeth Holmes. She is a talented person who rose to fame too quickly, until Theranos was challenged by a&nbsp;<em>Wall Street Journal&nbsp;</em>investigation. On the surface, Holmes’ story seemed to be the perfect narrative. The would-be Silicon Valley entrepreneur dropped out of Stanford at the age of 19 to found Theranos, a company attempting to replace blood-testing draws with single drops from the finger. Holmes’ rapid rise to fame put her on a fast track to success, with high expectations and intense pressures. Yet she hadn’t had adequate leadership experience attacking and leading people through difficult business problems.</p><em>Wall Street Journal&nbsp;</em><p>Holmes created a $9 billion valuation on paper by selling venture capitalists on her idea and raising $400 million. She assembled a celebrity board, convinced Safeway to spend $350 million to build clinics in its supermarkets, and signed partnerships with Cleveland Clinic and Walgreens. She attracted celebrity media attention with headlines like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/biotech/2014/09/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-stanford-forbes-richest.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“Queen Elizabeth: Mystique of Theranos Founder Grows.”</a>&nbsp;She received prestigious accolades, being named Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship, youngest winner of the Horatio Alger Award, and one of Time’s 100 Most Influential People (2015).</p><a href=\"http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/blog/biotech/2014/09/theranos-elizabeth-holmes-stanford-forbes-richest.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“Queen Elizabeth: Mystique of Theranos Founder Grows.”</a><p>Then it all came crashing down.</p><p>On October 16,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Wall Street Journal reported</a>&nbsp;that the data&nbsp;Theranos submitted were insufficient to prove the accuracy of many of its tests.&nbsp;In spite of her seeking media visibility, Holmes did not offer comments&nbsp;for this article. Five days later, she said the company was in a “pause period.”&nbsp;Subsequently,&nbsp;Walgreens&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/24/walgreens-theranos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">halted expansion</a>&nbsp;of its Theranos blood-testing centers, and in early November, Safeway announced&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/safeway-theranos-split-after-350-million-deal-fizzles-1447205796\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dissolution of its partnership</a>.</p><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/theranos-has-struggled-with-blood-tests-1444881901\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Wall Street Journal reported</a><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/10/24/walgreens-theranos/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">halted expansion</a><a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/safeway-theranos-split-after-350-million-deal-fizzles-1447205796\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">dissolution of its partnership</a><p>A famous quote says: “You can fool all the people some of the time, and some of the people all the time, but you cannot fool all the people all the time.” Maybe the “fake it till you make it” leadership approach&nbsp;will work for a while, but it will eventually catch up with you.</p><p>Contrast the fake it approach&nbsp;with that of&nbsp;Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, an open and transparent authentic leader whom I profile in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.discoveryourtruenorth.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Discover Your True North</em></a>. Unlike the “rocket ship” career ladder Holmes pursued, Sandberg’s career path took on the shape of a “jungle gym” that she described in&nbsp;<em>Lean In</em>. “I could never have connected the dots from where I started to where I am today,” she wrote.</p><a href=\"http://www.discoveryourtruenorth.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Discover Your True North</em></a><em>Discover Your True North</em><em>Lean In</em><p>After graduating from Harvard Business School, Sandberg worked as a management consultant at McKinsey and for Treasury Secretary Larry Summers for six years before joining Google at 32. When she and Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg began working together in 2007, Sandberg requested that Zuckerberg provide her with weekly feedback.</p><p>After the tragic death last spring of her husband Dave Goldberg, Sandberg shared a touching Facebook&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sheryl/posts/10155617891025177:0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a>, hoping her story would help others. She wrote, “I realized that to restore that closeness with my colleagues, I needed to let them in. That meant being more open and vulnerable than I ever wanted to be.”</p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sheryl/posts/10155617891025177:0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">post</a><p>It takes immense bravery to be so honest and open with the world, but realizing that others accept and love you for who you are liberates you as an authentic leader.</p><p>I strongly support young leaders like Larry Page and Zuckerberg who start their own businesses. You can get started with little management experience, but to sustain success, it is essential to surround yourself with more experienced leaders as Zuckerberg found with Sandberg. Google founders Page and Sergey Brin followed a similar course by recruiting Eric Schmidt as CEO. It is also important to seek out wise mentors, as Zuckerberg did with Washington Post CEO Donald Graham and venture capitalist Marc Andreessen.</p><p>That’s what I learned to do as the 27-year-old general manager of Litton Industries’ microwave oven division. I recruited an experienced team of appliance industry veterans, including the marketing and sales head who was twice my age and earned twice my salary. Had I tried to fake my leadership and knowledge of the appliance industry, I surely would have failed.</p><p>In the research for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.discoveryourtruenorth.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Discover Your True North</em></a>, we interviewed 170 leaders from 23 to 93 years old. Not one of them talked about faking it to get ahead. What stood out for every one of them was how hard they had worked to develop themselves, and the painful lessons they learned from their mistakes and failures. Through those very difficult experiences they developed the self-awareness, confidence, courage and resilience to persevere through the most difficult challenges, and imbue their colleagues with confidence in their leadership and ability to succeed.</p><a href=\"http://www.discoveryourtruenorth.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Discover Your True North</em></a><em>Discover Your True North</em><p>In contrast, leaders who are faking it only fool themselves, as others see through them and are pained by their acting. Sometimes this approach impresses their bosses, which may be good for a promotion or two, but eventually falls apart when they are unable to win support from peers and subordinates.</p><p>All leaders are human, subject to frailties and mistakes, but inauthentic leaders lare often are afraid to face their failures and may try to hide them or blame others. Holmes appears to have talent, ambition, and intellect, but these qualities, unbalanced by authenticity,&nbsp;may&nbsp;have magnified her difficulties.</p><p>Authentic leaders are real and genuine. They acknowledge their shortcomings and admit their errors, which enables them to connect with others and inspire teammates. Their leadership is built on their character and values, as they embrace the vital experiences that shape them, and are comfortable in their skin.</p><p>That’s why Sheryl Sandberg has been so successful, a great partner for Mark Zuckerberg, and wise adviser to millions who have read&nbsp;<em>Lean In</em>. Leaders like Sandberg understand they won’t make it if they fake it, but they will succeed by being authentic.</p><em>Lean In</em><p><em>Bill George is the author of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Discover-Your-True-North-George/dp/1119082943/ref=sr_1_1_twi_har_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447178147&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=discover+your+true+north\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discover Your True North</a>,&nbsp;a&nbsp;senior fellow at Harvard Business School, and former chair and CEO of Medtronic.</em></p><em>Bill George is the author of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Discover-Your-True-North-George/dp/1119082943/ref=sr_1_1_twi_har_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447178147&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=discover+your+true+north\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discover Your True North</a>,&nbsp;a&nbsp;senior fellow at Harvard Business School, and former chair and CEO of Medtronic.</em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Discover-Your-True-North-George/dp/1119082943/ref=sr_1_1_twi_har_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447178147&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=discover+your+true+north\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discover Your True North</a><hr size=\"1\"><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>This article was originally published on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/you-won-t-make-it-if-you-fake-it\">Harvard Working Knowledge</a>&nbsp;12/08/15.</em></p><em>This article was originally published on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/you-won-t-make-it-if-you-fake-it\">Harvard Working Knowledge</a>&nbsp;12/08/15.</em><a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/you-won-t-make-it-if-you-fake-it\">Harvard Working Knowledge</a><div><em>&nbsp;</em></div><em>&nbsp;</em>"

      "<p>Effective leaders are emotionally intelligent. They have the skills to manage and use their emotions. And, like all&nbsp;<a href=\"http://morethansound.net/shop/what-makes-leader-why-emotional-intelligence-matters/#.VmQ5UsozyCQ\" target=\"_blank\">leadership skills</a>, emotional skills&nbsp;– the attitude and abilities with which someone approaches life and work&nbsp;– can be learned and developed.

Emotional skills are partly inborn, but experience plays a major role in how the genes are expressed. Research suggests that our range of emotional skills is relatively set by our mid-20s and that our accompanying behaviors are, by that time, deep-seated habits. The more we act a certain way – be it happy, depressed, or cranky – the more the behavior becomes ingrained in our brain circuitry, and the more we will continue to feel and act that way.</p><a href=\"http://morethansound.net/authors/richard-boyatzis/#.VmB3-HuR84U\" target=\"_blank\">Richard Boyatzis</a><p>An emotionally intelligent leader can monitor his or her moods through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-self-awareness-impacts-your-work-daniel-goleman?trk=mp-reader-card\" target=\"_blank\">self-awareness</a>, change them for the better through self-management, understand their impact through empathy, and act in ways that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140619144049-117825785-be-mindful-of-the-emotions-you-leave-behind?trk=mp-reader-card\" target=\"_blank\">boost others’ moods</a>&nbsp;through relationship management.</p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-self-awareness-impacts-your-work-daniel-goleman?trk=mp-reader-card\" target=\"_blank\">self-awareness</a><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20140619144049-117825785-be-mindful-of-the-emotions-you-leave-behind?trk=mp-reader-card\" target=\"_blank\">boost others’ moods</a><p>The following five-part process is designed to rewire the brain toward more emotionally intelligent behaviors. The process includes:</p><ul>\n<li>imagining your ideal self,</li>\n<li>coming to terms with your real self (as others experience you),</li>\n<li>creating a tactical plan to bridge the gap between ideal and real,</li>\n<li>practicing those activities.</li>\n</ul><li>imagining your ideal self,</li><li>coming to terms with your real self (as others experience you),</li><li>creating a tactical plan to bridge the gap between ideal and real,</li><li>practicing those activities.</li><p>It concludes with creating a community of colleagues, friends and family – call them change enforcers – to keep the process alive. Let’s look at the steps in more detail.</p><p><strong>IDEAL SELF</strong></p><strong>IDEAL SELF</strong><p>Erica, a senior manager at a global telecommunications company, communicated poorly when she felt stressed. For example, she often took over a teammate’s work so the job would be done&nbsp;<em>right</em>. After many complaints, her supervisors encouraged her to attend leadership seminars, read management books, and work with mentors. Nothing worked. She couldn’t shake her bad habits.</p><em>right</em><p>As a last resort, Erica started&nbsp;<a href=\"http://morethansound.net/shop/the-coaching-program/#.VmQ6QcozyCQ\" target=\"_blank\">working with a coach</a>. She was asked to imagine herself five years from now as an effective leader. She was urged to consider her deepest values and loftiest dreams and to explain how those ideals had become a part of her everyday life.</p><a href=\"http://morethansound.net/shop/the-coaching-program/#.VmQ6QcozyCQ\" target=\"_blank\">working with a coach</a><p>Erica pictured herself leading her own tight-knit company staffed by 10 colleagues. She saw herself as a positive force to her colleagues, family and friends.</p><p>Erica had a low level of self-awareness. She was rarely able to pinpoint why she was struggling at work and at home. All she could say was, “Nothing is working right.” This exercise opened her eyes to the missing elements in her emotional style. She was able to see the impact she had on people in her life.</p><p><strong>CURRENT SELF</strong></p><strong>CURRENT SELF</strong><p>Leaders can become self-aware by seeing themselves through the eyes of those around them.

      "<p>Warren Bennis was one of the great pioneers in the field of leadership. Small in physical stature, he was a giant in his intellect, his heart, and his spirit. Just as Peter Drucker was the father of management, Warren was the “father of leadership.”</p><p>A lifelong scholar, in 1971 he became president of the University of Cincinnati at the height of student unrest and rebellion during the Vietnam War. He soon learned that leading a complex institution was not his sweet spot. As he reflected on the experience, “I was never going to be able to be happy with&nbsp;positional power. What I really wanted was personal power, having influence based on my voice. My real gift is what I can do in the classroom and as a mentor.” Subsequently, he mentored countless students, colleagues, and friends.</p><p>We first met at the World Economic Forum in the late 1990s. He suffered from heart problems, and relied on a Medtronic defibrillator (I was CEO of the company at the time). In December of 2000 I invited him as my guest to our headquarters for a gathering of 10,000 people, where he graciously thanked the employees who designed and manufactured his defibrillator. While I respected him deeply, I never anticipated the profound influence he’d have on my life.</p><p>In 2002, my wife, Penny, and I attended a seminar Warren&nbsp;and Harvard professor David Gergen led at the Aspen Institute. At the time I was struggling to find a publisher for a book I was writing for developing leaders to be their authentic selves, rather than feeling they had to be celebrity leaders or emulate others.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Warren introduced me to Jossey-Bass which became my publisher, and he included&nbsp;<em>Authentic Leadership</em>&nbsp;in 2003 in the Warren Bennis Signature Series. Throughout my writing process, he offered specific suggestions to improve its content, guiding me through his ideas on crucibles and ways to personalize my own stories more passionately. When I got to Part III, he suggested a radical restructuring of its content to make it come alive for readers. As he wrote in the foreword, “Timeless leadership is always about character, and it is always about authenticity.” He lived that philosophy throughout his life.</p><em>Authentic Leadership</em><p>We spent many hours together, with Warren pushing me to think more critically and write more eloquently. When co-author Peter Sims and I were writing&nbsp;<em>True North</em>, he spent a solid week guiding us through the structuring of our ideas. He proposed having a representative story kick off each chapter, and then walked through each sub-section of the book with us, challenged our ideas to make them concrete and illustrated by specific examples. He even offer quotes from literature, to illustrate the text, such as this one from novelist John Barth, “The story of your life is not your life. It is your story.”</p><em>True North</em><p>Two months before he died in 2014, Warren asked Penny and me to discuss leadership in the next-to-last class he ever taught. What other professors have you known who were still teaching at age 89? Although beset with bodily ills, his mind was sharp as ever and his warmth and humanity shone in the classroom and in our private interactions.</p><p>Over dinner that evening Penny asked what he would like on his tombstone. He replied without hesitation, “Generous Friend.” A generous friend is just what Warren&nbsp;was to me and many students, scholars, friends, and mentees whom he influenced with kindness, buoyancy of spirit, and wisdom.</p><p>His&nbsp;last book,&nbsp;<em>Still Surprised</em>, shows his photo walking barefoot on the beach with his pant legs rolled up, leaving behind large footprints in the sand – reminding me of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow’s poem,&nbsp;<em>A Psalm of Life</em>:</p><em>Still Surprised</em><em>A Psalm of Life</em><p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives of great men all remind us</em></p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lives of great men all remind us</em><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We can make our lives sublime,</em></p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We can make our lives sublime,</em><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, departing, leave behind us</em></p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, departing, leave behind us</em><p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Footprints on the sands of time.</em></p><em>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Footprints on the sands of time.</em><p>Unlike many scholars who jealously protect their ideas, Warren Bennis always encouraged me and others to build on his ideas and share them with leaders throughout the world. A generous friend is indeed what he was.</p><hr size=\"1\"><p><em>This article was originally published on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://observer.com/2015/12/warren-bennis-led-by-example/\">Observer Culture</a>.&nbsp;</em></p><em>This article was originally published on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://observer.com/2015/12/warren-bennis-led-by-example/\">Observer Culture</a>.&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://observer.com/2015/12/warren-bennis-led-by-example/\">Observer Culture</a>"

You weren’t guarding what you said. You weren’t monitoring how others perceived you. And you shared life stories you rarely&nbsp;do.</p><p>You were vulnerable, and you were perfectly authentic with others, and you were accepted by them — and that gave you a deep sense of well-being.</p><p>For many of us, we achieve this level of vulnerability only with our closest family and friends. Even then, we rarely expose our deepest secrets, as we hide behind masks, excuses, and obfuscations.</p><p>For many years of my career, I lacked the confidence to share my weaknesses, fears, and vulnerabilities. I thought I had to be perfect and not show vulnerability. It wasn’t until I had a crucible in my forties and realized I was losing sight of my True North of helping others by trying too hard to succeed. When I opened up and let go of my insecurities, I felt more comfortable in my skin and had a stronger sense of well-being, and my relationships with colleagues improved.</p><p>A year after I joined Medtronic, I faced a test of my willingness to admit my mistakes. I reorganized the company around three global regions and appointed an experienced executive from a subsidiary company as president of Europe. Several colleagues were wary of him due to his aggressiveness but I felt he was exactly what we needed.</p><p>Six months later our general counsel informed me that our auditors had uncovered a bribery fund he had been running in the European subsidiary by funneling money from secret Swiss bank accounts to Italian physicians. We terminated him immediately and reported the issue to U.S. and European authorities. That turned out to be the easy part.</p><p>It was much more difficult to explain to our board of directors and executive team that I had made the mistake by failing to investigate his values. Because I admitted my mistakes and acted vulnerably, the board supported me fully, and respected me more because I took full responsibility rather than blaming him.</p><p>In his book Love Leadership, John Hope Bryant, who was homeless for six months as a teenager, proclaims, “Vulnerability is power.” When I share this idea with executives in my classroom, a look of apprehension comes over their faces. Yet, by being vulnerable you can connect authentically with others. By being open, you retain the power, rather than acting in fear of being unmasked and exposed. As Bryant says, “Vulnerability is the key to freedom.”</p><p>Bryant backs it up with his life story and personal experiences of being vulnerable. He grew up in a poor family in the rough neighborhood of South Central Los Angeles. After his parents divorced when he was five, Bryant’s life was like a roller coaster. He had a strong work ethic and an entrepreneurial spark that resulted in some early business successes but by his late teens, he was struggling. As he told me, “I faked it, acting like a big cheese, wearing sunglasses at night to feel important. It was just low self-esteem. Then I came up short one too many times, lost an investor’s money and couldn’t pay him back, and wound up homeless.”</p><p>Bryant has learned that acknowledging his life experiences to others has given him power and intense healing. As he shared in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/\">Discover Your True North</a>, “If I don’t feel comfortable in my skin, I am unwilling to be vulnerable. To heal, you’ve got to get over the fear of just being yourself.”</p><a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/\">Discover Your True North</a><p>Bryant’s vulnerability is his power. In my classroom he openly described the pain he experienced in being homeless. He comes across as less than perfect, which makes him more sympathetic, authentic, and persuasive. Others connect with him, as evidenced by former president Bill Clinton, former ambassador Andrew Young, and Fortune 500 CEOs who are partnering with Bryant’s organization, Operation Hope.</p><p>What would it mean if we were willing to be vulnerable and expose our full selves to the world by just being our authentic selves? No more false layers of protection. At first, it might be scary, but as we realize that people accept and love us for who we really are, it would be liberating: I can be who I am.</p><p>The more often we can achieve this vulnerability, the greater our sense of well-being. To begin, try opening up with your close friends and family by telling them a single insecurity, memory, or loss that you haven’t shared before.</p><p>In the beginning of this post, I asked you to imagine a moment when you were perfectly comfortable with others. Now, imagine the opposite. Perhaps it was a high-risk, high-impact moment: a job interview, a board meeting, or a tense argument with a loved one. In that moment, think of how difficult it was is to share how you felt. But when you did, it was liberating.</p><p>As you grow more comfortable, share these stories with more people around you. At first, you may feel uneasy until you recognize that they accept you as you are. As you open yourself, others will open up as well, thus beginning a virtuous circle of vulnerability.</p><p>Embrace those moments to share and be vulnerable. Now you have the power, and no one can take it from you.</p>"

      "<p>Successful leaders live complex and demanding lives. As the frequency of communication has intensified, the pace of business has increased.</p><p>Yet many of us have not learned how to deal with this. There is never enough time to doeverything you want to do, because the world around you makes ever greater demands on your time. Nor will you be able to achieve a perfect balance between all aspects of your life – career, family, friends and community, and personal life. Inevitably, you will have to make trade-offs. How you do so will determine how fulfilling your life will be.</p><p>Authentic leaders are aware of the importance of staying grounded. In doing so, they avoid getting too cocky during high points and forgetting who they are during low points. Spending time with family and close friends, getting physical exercise, having spiritual practices, doing community service, and returning to places where they grew up are all ways to stay grounded. This grounding is essential to their effectiveness as leaders because it enables them to preserve their authenticity.</p><p>To avoid letting professional commitments dominate their time, authentic leaders must give priority to their families and take care of themselves personally, in terms of their health, recreation, spirituality, and introspection. There is no silver-bullet solution to this issue, but neglecting to integrate the facets of life can derail you. To lead an integrated life, you need to bring together the major elements of your personal life and professional life, including work, family, community, and friends, so that you can be the same person in each environment. For authentic leaders, being true to themselves by being the same person at work that they are at home is a constant test, yet personal fulfilment is their ultimate reward. Doing so will make you a more effective leader in all aspects of your life.</p><p><strong>Stay Grounded</strong></p><strong>Stay Grounded</strong><p>To integrate your life, you must remain grounded in your authentic self, especially when the outside world is chaotic. Well-grounded leaders have a steady and confident presence. They do not show up as one person one day and another the next. Integration takes discipline, particularly during stressful times, when it is easy to become reactive and slip into bad habits.</p><p>Leading is high-stress work. There is no way to avoid stress when you are responsible for people, organizations, outcomes, and uncertainties of the environment. For global leaders, long overseas trips intensify the stress. The higher you go, the greater your freedom to control your destiny but also the higher the stress. The question is not whether you can avoid stress but how you can manage and relieve it to maintain your own sense of equilibrium.</p><p>When Medtronic’s Chris O’Connell gets stressed, he said:</p><p>“I feel myself slipping into a negative frame of mind. When I’m at my best, I’m very positive and feel I can accomplish anything, both at work and home. When I become negative, I lose effectiveness as a leader and become even less effective at home. Both positive and negative emotions carry over between work and home.”</p><p><strong>Focus on What Matters</strong></p><strong>Focus on What Matters</strong><p>When Sheryl Sandberg worked as a McKinsey management consultant, her manager implored her to take more control over her career, telling her, “McKinsey will never stop making demands on our time, so it is our responsibility to draw the line … We need to determine how many hours we are willing to work and how many nights we travel.”</p><p>After the birth of her son, Sandberg adjusted her in-office hours at Google to 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., enabling her to nurse her son. To compensate, Sandberg got up in the early morning hours to check e-mails and worked at home after her son went to bed. She learned that by focusing her time, she did not need to spend 12 hours a day in the office.</p><p>“I focused on what really mattered and became more efficient, only attending meetings that were truly necessary. I was determined to maximize my output while away from home,” said Sandberg. “I also paid more attention to the working hours of those around me; cutting unnecessary meetings saved time for them as well.”</p><p><strong>Stay true to your roots</strong></p><strong>Stay true to your roots</strong><p>Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz goes back to Brooklyn from time to time, Intuit Chairman Bill Campbell stays in regular contact with his old friends in Homestead, Penn., which helps him keep perspective on life in Silicon Valley. To restore themselves and keep their sense of perspective, leaders may have a special place they can go with their families on weekends and vacations. Many renowned leaders found they can think more clearly when they escape: Thomas Jefferson had Poplar Forest and Winston Churchill had Chartwell. For decades, former U.S. secretary of state George Shultz and his wife went to an old family farm they own in Massachusetts.</p><p>“I once told the president, ‘This is my Camp David,’” said Shultz. “When I go there, I put on an old pair of pants and old shoes. I am so relaxed, I don’t worry about anything.”</p><p><strong>Find time for yourself</strong></p><strong>Find time for yourself</strong><p>To manage the stress of our leadership roles, we need personal time to reflect. Some people practise meditation or yoga to centre themselves and relieve anxiety. Others find solace in prayer. Some people find they can release tension by jogging. Others find relief through laughing with friends, listening to music, reading, or going to movies. It’s not important what you do, as long as you establish routines to relieve your stress and think clearly about life, work, and personal issues. It is critical not to abandon these routines when facing an especially busy period, because that is when you most need your stress reduction techniques.</p><hr size=\"1\"><p><em>This article was originally posted to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/leadership-lab/staying-grounded-is-key-to-balancing-life-and-leadership/article27229415/?cmpid=rss1&amp;click=dlvr.it&amp;hootPostID=454d0648081f4105f312c7ccc9c783f8\">The Toronto Globe and Mail</a></em></p><em>This article was originally posted to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/leadership-lab/staying-grounded-is-key-to-balancing-life-and-leadership/article27229415/?cmpid=rss1&amp;click=dlvr.it&amp;hootPostID=454d0648081f4105f312c7ccc9c783f8\">The Toronto Globe and Mail</a></em><a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/careers/leadership-lab/staying-grounded-is-key-to-balancing-life-and-leadership/article27229415/?cmpid=rss1&amp;click=dlvr.it&amp;hootPostID=454d0648081f4105f312c7ccc9c783f8\">The Toronto Globe and Mail</a>"

      "<p><em>Originally posted to Huffington Post on 11/12/15</em></p><em>Originally posted to Huffington Post on 11/12/15</em><p>Last week my wife Penny and I had the opportunity to keynote the Mindful Leadership Summit. At the summit, 750 participants gathered to discuss how mindfulness practices could change global leadership for the better. As Charles Lief, president of Naropa University, said, “The opening of all sectors to talk about mindfulness, contemplation and compassion is a very powerful thing.” The enthusiasm within the summit provided ample evidence that mindful leadership has indeed come of age.</p><p>How are leaders becoming mindful? One of the most popular ways to learn mindfulness is to attend a Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) course. Popularized by Jon Kabat-Zinn since the late 1970s, MBSR is built on ancient meditation practices. However, it wasn’t until the last decade that the marriage of mindfulness and leadership became reality. In 2007 Chade-Meng Tan – Google employee #107 — launched Google’s meditation program. The program currently teaches 2,000 Googlers per year to meditate in order to become better leaders.</p><p>In January, 2010 I had the privilege of presenting my ideas for developing compassionate, authentic leaders to the Dalai Lama at the Mind &amp; Life Institute’s conference in Zurich. The following year Janice Marturano formed the Institute for Mindful Leadership, based on the highly successful courses she created for General Mills. Today, leading companies like Blackrock, Aetna, Ford Motor and Goldman Sachs conduct mindfulness classes for thousands of their leaders.</p><p>What is causing this shift to mindful leadership? In the stress-filled 24/7 world in which we live, leaders of all organizations need the opportunity for a “time out” period. It is their opportunity to relax, breathe deeply, de-stress and gain clarity about their work and the decisions they are facing. As I stressed at last week’s summit, mindfulness practices enable leaders to ensure the important issues are taking precedence over immediate pressures.</p><p>Business isn’t the only sector practicing mindfulness. These practices are gaining widespread use in health care, non-profits, education, athletics and even government. Recent clinical studies are demonstrating that mindfulness not only&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.massgeneral.org/about/pressrelease.aspx?id=1520\" target=\"_hplink\">reduces stress</a>, it improves productivity and reduces health care costs. As Aetna learned in its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www1.aetna.com/news/newsReleases/2011/0113_mindbody.html\" target=\"_hplink\">2011 controlled study of meditation and yoga</a>, health care costs for participating employees could be reduced by $2000 a year. As a result, Aetna is currently offering mindfulness classes as a covered benefit to its enrollees.</p><a href=\"http://www.massgeneral.org/about/pressrelease.aspx?id=1520\" target=\"_hplink\">reduces stress</a><a href=\"https://www1.aetna.com/news/newsReleases/2011/0113_mindbody.html\" target=\"_hplink\">2011 controlled study of meditation and yoga</a><p>My own mindfulness practice began with a course in Transcendental Meditation (TM) that my wife and I attended in 1974. For the past forty years I have meditated daily. It wasn’t until the late 1990s that I felt comfortable sharing my practice publicly, as I feared people would find it strange or even weird. This practice is the best thing I have done to calm my mind and my emotions, focus on what is most important while releasing trivial worries and think clearly about important decisions. Perhaps even more importantly, my most creative ideas have come from meditation.</p><p>Of course, meditation is not for everyone. What is essential for all of us — as I share in my classes and lectures — is having a daily practice of taking twenty minutes to quiet your mind, reflect and be introspective. For you, it may come through prayer, journaling, reflecting in a beautiful place or taking a long walk or jog. The goal? To create more self-aware leaders who understand themselves, their motivations, their values and the purpose of their leadership.</p><p>Becoming a mindful leaders requires daily practice. It is easy to say, as I did back in 1974, that you don’t have the time to fit this practice into your busy schedule. In fact, the opposite is true — you don’t have the time not to pursue it. A recent study by Aetna and Duke University proved that mindful practices can increase productivity by&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/business/at-aetna-a-ceos-management-by-mantra.html\" target=\"_hplink\">an hour a week</a>. Just think what you could do with an extra hour: Play with your children? Take a walk with your spouse? Organize your life? However you use that extra time, mindfulness can help you accomplish it. More importantly, you will become more effective and satisfied in your work.</p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/01/business/at-aetna-a-ceos-management-by-mantra.html\" target=\"_hplink\">an hour a week</a><p>As I discuss in my new book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/\" target=\"_hplink\">Discover Your True North</a>, mindful leaders can help us begin to overcome the crisis in leadership we have experienced since 2001. Simply stated, mindfulness is a powerful practice that will help all of us become more authentic as leaders. If you haven’t experienced it, give it a try, and you will find that you have a greater sense of well-being and become a better leader.</p><a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/\" target=\"_hplink\">Discover Your True North</a>"

This is a sea change from 2003 when I wrote&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Authentic-Leadership-Rediscovering-Secrets-Creating/dp/0787969133/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\">Authentic Leadership</a>. Back then, many people asked what it meant to be authentic.</p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Authentic-Leadership-Rediscovering-Secrets-Creating/dp/0787969133/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\">Authentic Leadership</a><p>Authentic Leadership was intended as a clarion call to the new generation to learn from negative examples like Enron, WorldCom and Tyco. In it, I defined authentic leaders as genuine, moral and character-based leaders:</p><p>“People of the highest integrity, committed to building enduring organizations … who have a deep sense of purpose and are true to their core values who have the courage to build their companies to meet the needs of all their stakeholders, and who recognize the importance of their service to society.”</p><p>Authentic leaders demonstrate these five qualities:</p><ul>\n<li>Understanding their purpose</li>\n<li>Practicing solid values</li>\n<li>Leading with heart</li>\n<li>Establishing connected relationships</li>\n<li>Demonstrating self-discipline</li>\n</ul><li>Understanding their purpose</li><li>Practicing solid values</li><li>Leading with heart</li><li>Establishing connected relationships</li><li>Demonstrating self-discipline</li><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The following year the Gallup Institute and Professor Bruce Avolio, a well-known leadership scholar at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, organized a definitive&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984305000263\">conference on authentic leadership</a>&nbsp;in which the importance of leaders’ life stories became paramount.</p><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984305000263\">conference on authentic leadership</a><p>In spite of widespread acceptance of authentic leadership—or perhaps because of it—several authors have recently challenged the value of being authentic, claiming it is an excuse for being locked into a rigid view of one’s leadership, being rude and insensitive, refusing to change, or not adapting to one’s style to the situation. These arguments appear to demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of what constitutes an authentic leader. Recommendations that leaders should accept narcissism, embrace their inner jerk, or focus on themselves will not work in the long-run.</p><p>In light of this public discussion, it’s important to rediscover authentic leadership as well as examine some of the recent mischaracterizations of it.</p><p>Authentic leadership is built on your character, not your style. My mentor Warren Bennis said, “Leadership is character. It is not just a superficial question of style. It has to do with who we are as human beings and the forces that shaped us.</p><p>Style is the outward manifestation of one’s authentic leadership, not one’s inner self. To become authentic leaders, people must adopt flexible styles that fit the situation and capabilities of their teammates. At times, authentic leaders are coaches and mentors, inspiring others and empowering their teammates to lead through the most important tasks without a great deal of supervision. At other times, authentic leaders must make very difficult decisions, terminating people and going against the will of the majority, as required to meet the situational imperative. These difficult actions can be taken while still retaining their authenticity.</p><p>Authentic leaders are real and genuine. You cannot “<a href=\"https://hbr.org/product/act-like-a-leader-think-like-a-leader/10953-HBK-ENG\">fake it till you make it</a>” by putting on a show as a leader or being a chameleon in your style. People sense very quickly who is authentic and who is not. Some leaders may pull it off for a while, but ultimately they will not gain the trust of their teammates, especially when dealing with difficult situations. The widespread adoption of LinkedIn, Google and increasingly networked communities means that every leader has the informal equivalent of a “Yelp” score that will come to light. If people see their leaders as trustworthy and willing to learn, followers will respond very positively to requests for help in getting through difficult times.</p><a href=\"https://hbr.org/product/act-like-a-leader-think-like-a-leader/10953-HBK-ENG\">fake it till you make it</a><p>Authentic leaders are constantly growing. They do not have a rigid view of themselves and their leadership. Becoming authentic is a developmental state that enables leaders to progress through multiple roles, as they learn and grow from their experiences. Like superior performances in athletics or music, becoming an authentic leader requires years of practice in challenging situations.</p><p>Authentic leaders match their behavior to their context, an essential part of emotional intelligence (EQ). They do not burst out with whatever they may be thinking or feeling. Rather, they exhibit self-monitoring, understand how they are being perceived, and use emotional intelligence (EQ) to communicate effectively.</p><p>Authentic leaders are not perfect, nor do they try to be. They make mistakes, but they are willing to admit their errors and learn from them. They know how to ask others for help. Nor are authentic leaders always humble or modest. It takes a great deal of self-confidence to lead through very difficult situations.</p><p>Authentic leaders are sensitive to the needs of others. One&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RLV2JFA/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\">author has postulated</a>, and I paraphrase, “What if your real self is a jerk?” People are not born as jerks, nor does this behavior reflect their authentic selves. Rather, these individuals likely had very negative experiences early in their lives that cause them to have difficulty in managing their anger, in part because they feel like victims or feel inadequate.</p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00RLV2JFA/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?ie=UTF8&amp;btkr=1\">author has postulated</a><p>Situations like these indicate the importance of processing one’s crucibles: people need not feel like victims or stuff their experiences deep inside themselves. Rather, by understanding themselves and reframing their experiences, they can find the pearl inside that represents their authentic selves. That’s why exploring who they are and getting honest feedback from their colleagues are essential elements of becoming authentic leaders. That’s what Starbucks’ Howard Schultz did in coping with the severe challenges of his youth. It is also what made the difference for Steve Jobs when he returned to Apple nine years after his 1986 termination.</p><p>For all these reasons, authentic leaders constitute the vast majority of people chosen today for the key roles in business and nonprofits. Their emergence as the predominant way of leading has resulted from all we have discovered about leadership in the past decade.&nbsp;</p><h2>A Human-Centered Approach to Leadership Development</h2><p>My 2007 book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/True-North-Discover-Authentic-Leadership/dp/0787987514/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447176251&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=true+north+bill+george\">True North</a>, showed people how they could develop themselves as authentic leaders. Whereas Authentic Leadership was based on my personal experiences in leading, True North was built on field research drawn from in-person interviews with 125 leaders. With 3,000 pages of transcripts, it remains as the largest in-depth study of leaders ever conducted, based on first-person interviews.</p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/True-North-Discover-Authentic-Leadership/dp/0787987514/ref=sr_1_cc_1?s=aps&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447176251&amp;sr=1-1-catcorr&amp;keywords=true+north+bill+george\">True North</a><p>Having examined the literature containing more than 1,000 studies of leaders, most of which employed third-person approaches of observations and questionnaires, our research team concluded that learning directly from these leaders about what was important to them and how they had developed would give us much richer insights than prior studies. Indeed, this proved to be the case, as we discovered the paramount importance of leaders’ life stories and the crucibles they had faced. We also learned from them how people develop into authentic leaders.</p><p>In our research, we embraced the richness of understanding leadership as a fully human endeavor. This approach built upon the pioneering work of Abraham Maslow, Carl Rogers, Douglas McGregor, Daniel Goleman and Warren Bennis.&nbsp;True North&nbsp;assembled this developmental process in an original approach that enabled people to develop themselves as authentic leaders.</p><p>In order to see how leadership has changed in the past decade, we initiated research in 2014 that focused on 47 new leaders who were more global and diverse than the original cohort. We also followed up on 90 leaders featured in&nbsp;True North&nbsp;to see how they have fared since their 2005-06 interviews. With only a couple of exceptions, we learned these leaders had remained true to their authentic selves, and had performed very well in myriad roles.&nbsp;</p><p>This research led to my new book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Discover-Your-True-North-George/dp/1119082943/ref=sr_1_1_twi_har_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447178147&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=discover+your+true+north\">Discover Your True North</a>, which profiles 101 leaders and describes how they developed. It also draws heavily upon classroom experiences in the Authentic Leadership Development courses at Harvard Business School, where 6,000 MBAs and executives have participated in this developmental process.</p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Discover-Your-True-North-George/dp/1119082943/ref=sr_1_1_twi_har_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1447178147&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=discover+your+true+north\">Discover Your True North</a><p>Most significantly, we learned that authentic leaders are constantly growing and learning from their leadership experiences. By taking on new challenges, they become more effective as authentic leaders. When they find themselves in entirely new situations, authentic leaders draw upon their true selves, what they have learned in past life experiences, especially their crucibles, and they learn from their new colleagues. This enables them to become more effective as leaders. This approach is similar to Stanford’s Carol Dweck’s “<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Success-Carol-Dweck/dp/1400062756/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\">growth mindset</a>.”</p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Mindset-Psychology-Success-Carol-Dweck/dp/1400062756/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=\">growth mindset</a><p>If you want to be an authentic leader and have a meaningful life, you need to do the difficult inner work to develop yourself, have a strong moral compass based on your beliefs and values, and work on problems that matter to you. When you look back on your life it may not be perfect, but it will be authentically yours.</p>"

It felt more like a college campus than a multi-billion dollar company. Yet behind the gyms, mindfulness classes, and gourmet free food, there are 20,000 engineers working furiously. Their goal: breakthrough products that transform the world.</p><p>To understand what makes Google so innovative, I studied two “insider’s books:” Laszlo Bock’s Work Rules and Chairman Eric Schmidt’s and Jonathan Rosenberg’s How Google Works. Nevertheless, it is still very difficult to figure out how Google actually works. The reason? While many companies proclaim they are egalitarian and work from the “bottom up,” Google actually does. Gmail, for example, began with a “spare time” project that led to the ubiquitous electronic mailing system many of us use.</p><p>Unlike Steve Jobs’ Apple, where the legendary founder had his hands on every product, Google CEO Larry Page and co-founder Sergei Brin give their technical teams wide latitude to experiment. This is how Google is able to attract such brilliant innovation leaders as Arthur Levinson, former CEO of Genentech, who is leading an initiative to combat aging. Understanding Google became even more difficult this fall when it morphed into Alphabet, the holding company that not only includes Google itself, but all its remarkably creative entities like self-driving cars and Google glass.</p><p>Beginning as a research project in 1996, Google has rapidly changed the world. Since developing the most successful search algorithm, PageRank, the company has expanded far beyond web search. Since going public in 2004, Google digitized millions of books with Google Books, mapped the world with Google Maps, and generated the first mass-produced, wearable technology – Google Glass.</p><p>History demonstrates that companies become less innovative as they grow, as size and creativity are inversely proportional. Not so with Google. So what is its secret?</p><p>In “8 Pillars of Innovation”, YouTube CEO Susan Wojcicki gives eight ways Google stays innovative. These include the mission, idea generation and willingness to fail. One pillar she overlooked, however, was “Develop Innovation Leaders.” These days there are thousands of creative innovators all over the world, but effective innovation leaders like Page and Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg are very rare. Yet without highly skilled innovation leaders throughout its organization, Google would never have produced so many innovative products and have so many more in its pipeline.</p><p>Take one of Google’s most innovative practices: its policy of giving 20% free time to engineers to work on independent projects. Initiated in 2004, the policy has begun innovations such as Gmail, Google News, and Ad Sense, but not without controversy. It is difficult for&nbsp;<em>any</em><em>&nbsp;</em>company to justify time for employees to work on small, side projects when the mainstream development projects are all-consuming. Without support of Google’s top leadership, the policy would never have succeeded.</p><em>any</em><em>&nbsp;</em><p>Ironically, Google has a history of underplaying the importance of leadership. In 2001, Page and Brin experimented with a completely flat organization, but the experiment only lasted a few months. Without clear leadership, it was difficult to communicate vision, handle logistics, and foster career development. Shortly thereafter, Schmidt became CEO, a position he held for a decade.</p><p>Since then, Google has recognized the importance of developing and hiring innovation leaders. In 2009, Google launched Project Oxygen – a three-year project to understand how the best managers at Google work. Implicit in this project was the understanding that great innovation leaders are required to drive great change. In order for Google to innovate as it has, it required the best minds in the world, and superb innovation leaders with the wisdom to know autonomy with respected inputs and challenges is required to inspire and retain high-powered innovators.</p><p>That’s also why Google became the holding company Alphabet – a loosely knit collection of interdependent units that can attract and empower more innovation leaders. As Bock argues in Work Rules, “Micromanagement is mismanagement.” Its collection of innovation organizations provides the freedom to innovate without near-term financial constraints. The new structure is designed to enable Google to retain such established innovation leaders as Google’s new CEO Sundar Pichai, Calico’s Levinson, Google X’s Astro Teller, Sidewalk Labs’ Dan Doctoroff, and venture capital leader Bill Maris.</p><p>These innovation leaders possess very different characteristics than most traditional leaders of large enterprises:</p><ul>\n<li>They are “We” leaders, not “I” leaders.</li>\n<li>They align their teams around an inspiring mission and set of values.</li>\n<li>They have high levels of emotional intelligence (EQ) combined with high IQs.</li>\n<li>They possess passion, compassion and courage.</li>\n<li>They are skilled at drawing out the best talents of innovators.</li>\n<li>They inspire, empower, support and protect their innovators and mavericks.</li>\n<li>They focus on bold long-term visions and aren’t deflected by short-term pressures.</li>\n<li>They are superb collaborators with other teams and other leaders.</li>\n</ul><li>They are “We” leaders, not “I” leaders.</li><li>They align their teams around an inspiring mission and set of values.</li><li>They have high levels of emotional intelligence (EQ) combined with high IQs.</li><li>They possess passion, compassion and courage.</li><li>They are skilled at drawing out the best talents of innovators.</li><li>They inspire, empower, support and protect their innovators and mavericks.</li><li>They focus on bold long-term visions and aren’t deflected by short-term pressures.</li><li>They are superb collaborators with other teams and other leaders.</li><p>Google’s model for nurturing innovation leaders may well become the gold standard for other organizations eager to create innovation breakthroughs, without the constant pressure of shareholders for immediate results.</p><p>At the very least, in itself it is a breakthrough.</p><div></div>"

I learned the hard way that leadership is not a singular destination but a marathon journey that progresses through many stages until you reach your peak. I was not alone. Of all the senior leaders we interviewed, none wound up where they thought they would.</p><p>Former Vanguard CEO Jack Brennan believes that the worst thing people can do is to manage their careers with a career map: “The dissatisfied people I have known and those who experienced ethical or legal failures all had a clear career plan.” Brennan recommended being flexible and venturesome in stepping up to unexpected opportunities. “If you’re only interested in advancing your career, you’ll wind up dissatisfied,” he said.</p><p>The idea of a career ladder places tremendous pressure on leaders to keep climbing ever higher. Instead, Sheryl Sandberg, chief operating officer (COO) of Facebook, favors the idea of a career “jungle gym” where you can move up, down, or across. Realistically, your development as a leader is a journey filled with many ups and downs as you progress to your peak leadership and continue leading through the final stage.</p><p>The leader’s journey follows the new span of life, which often runs into the nineties. Individuals move through three periods of leadership with different types of leadership opportunities unfolding in each. There will be differences in the pace at which leaders navigate the timeline, but there are many commonalities among their experiences.</p><p><strong>Phase I: Preparing for Leadership</strong></p><strong>Phase I: Preparing for Leadership</strong><p>Phase I is preparing for leadership, when character forms and people act as individual contributors or lead teams for the first time. Today, very few leaders make career commitments in their twenties. Increasingly, they use the time following college to gain valuable work experience, oftentimes changing jobs every 18 to 24 months to diversify their experience. Many young leaders are interested in going to graduate school in business, law, or government. Even some who complete their master’s degrees prefer individual contributor roles in consulting or finance before committing to a specific company or industry.</p><p>There is a natural amount of self-absorption in this phase. Measures of success in your teens and twenties are based primarily on what you accomplish as an individual. Your performance determines what schools you are admitted to and how well you do in your work. Here’s how Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers’s Randy Komisar described it:</p><p><em>We begin life on a linear path where success is based on clear targets. Life gets complicated when the targets aren’t clear, and you have to set your own. By rubbing up against the world, you get to know yourself. Either do that, or you’re going to spend your life serving the interests and expectations of others.</em></p><em>We begin life on a linear path where success is based on clear targets. Life gets complicated when the targets aren’t clear, and you have to set your own. By rubbing up against the world, you get to know yourself. Either do that, or you’re going to spend your life serving the interests and expectations of others.</em><p>He acknowledged that the start of the journey is particularly hard for young people “They look at me and say, ‘Hey, man. All I want to do is to get a good job, buy a house, get married, and have kids.’” Komisar said he wished life were so simple. Instead, he tells them:</p><p><em>Let me just plant this seed. Keep it alive and come back to it in 10 years, but don’t flush it. Ask yourself the question “What do you want out of your life?” I want to empower you for that time when it’s relevant to you.</em></p><em>Let me just plant this seed. Keep it alive and come back to it in 10 years, but don’t flush it. Ask yourself the question “What do you want out of your life?” I want to empower you for that time when it’s relevant to you.</em><p><strong>Wendy Kopp: Stepping Up at 21</strong></p><strong>Wendy Kopp: Stepping Up at 21</strong><p>As a student at Princeton, Wendy Kopp developed a passion to transform K–12 education. Growing up in a middle-class family in an affluent Dallas suburb, she lived in a community that was “extraordinarily isolated from reality and the disparities in educational opportunity.” Kopp was influenced by her freshman roommate at Princeton, who was from inner-city New York. Kopp described her roommate as brilliant but unable to keep up with her studies because her high school had not prepared her for the rigors of Princeton. Ultimately, her roommate dropped out of school.</p><p>As a senior, Kopp burned with desire to transform education but didn’t know how to get there. Not wanting to pursue the typical corporate-training track, she went into “a deep funk.” As she explored teaching, she realized many others also believed that depriving kids of an excellent education was a national tragedy.</p><p>So she organized a conference of students and business leaders to examine ways to improve K–12 education. During the conference, an idea came to her: “Why doesn’t this country have a national teacher corps of recent college graduates who commit two years to teach in public schools?” Her rhetorical question inspired her to found Teach For America (TFA), the most successful secondary educational program of the past 25 years.</p><p>Kopp’s journey wasn’t easy. Lacking management experience and permanent funding, Teach For America was constantly short of cash, lurching from one crisis to the next. Time and again, Kopp threw herself into fundraising as she restructured budgets and financing to cover deficits. After working 100 hours a week for five years to build TFA to 500 new teachers per year, Kopp felt overwhelmed by the financial pressures of raising money to keep the organization going.</p><p>When many initial funders decided not to continue funding the organization, losses mounted to a cumulative deficit of $2.5 million. A blistering critique of TFA in an influential educators’ journal said, “TFA is bad policy and bad education. It is bad for the recruits. It is bad for the schools. It is bad for the children.” Reflecting on the article, Kopp recalled, “It felt like a punch in the chest. I read it more as a personal attack than an academic analysis of our efforts.” When some of her original team left TFA, Kopp thought about shutting it down. “Yet my passion for our cause and fear that we might let the children down kept me going,” she said.</p><p>Kopp’s experience at such a young age is the essence of authentic leadership: Find something you are passionate about, and inspire others to join the cause. TFA’s crisis accelerated her development as a leader. Twenty years after founding TFA, Kopp’s tireless efforts and passionate leadership have paid off. Today the program has 11,000 corps members who are teaching more than 750,000 students.</p><p><strong>Ian Chan: Creating a Scientific Revolution</strong></p><strong>Ian Chan: Creating a Scientific Revolution</strong><p>Ian Chan is another young leader who discovered his passion to lead at an early age. As his college graduation approached, he knew he wanted “an opportunity that would get me excited to jump out of bed every day and go to work.” After uninspiring experiences in investment banking and private equity, he and his younger brother focused on the human genome revolution.</p><p>The Chan brothers founded U.S. Genomics to revolutionize medicine by delivering personalized genomics on a broad scale. They attracted noted advisers, such as scientist Craig Venter, who originally mapped the human genome, and Bob Langer, a renowned technologist. They began with a $100,000 credit card loan, and subsequently raised $52 million from venture capitalists, several of whom joined the board as the Chan brothers gave up more than half their ownership.</p><p>Over the next five years the company’s work attracted attention in the scientific community and venture capital world as U.S. Genomics became a pioneer in its field. When the founders presented the company’s exceptional performance in December 2001, the board gave them a standing ovation. Yet, as the full potential of U.S. Genomics became apparent to the venture capitalists, they decided they needed a more experienced executive to lead it. Four months later, Chan was shocked when his board told him he was being replaced as CEO. “To this day, I have no idea why this happened when things were going so well,” he said.</p><p><em>I put my heart and soul into it for many years, and then boom, it’s all gone. It was gut-wrenching to have something taken away that I created and believed in deeply. I still had some shares, but I wasn’t part of the enterprise anymore with its mission I believe in. I wanted to continue fighting, but I felt helpless. In hindsight, it was a rich experience I can build on for the next journey. I had been working crazy hours and was very tired. I didn’t have a personal life and needed more balance. To regroup, I spent two years getting my MBA. That provided time for self-reflection and opportunities to interact with some of the world’s top business leaders.</em></p><em>I put my heart and soul into it for many years, and then boom, it’s all gone.

That provided time for self-reflection and opportunities to interact with some of the world’s top business leaders.</em><p><em>I realized I was still fortunate to have my health, family, and the privilege of living in a free country.

They raised $1.5 million in seed capital but have retained more than 50 percent ownership to avoid repeating the U.S. Genomics experience.

If you want to go far, go together.” – African Proverb</em></p><em>“If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.” – African Proverb</em><p>Who can you turn to when life gets tough? Who do you have… when you’re alone?</p><p>Over the past 20 years, Americans have faced a crisis of community. As Robert Putnam documented in his famous book “Bowling Alone: America’s Declining Social Capital”, we’re spending less and less time with each other. As technology connects us, it changes the types of relationships we have. We have more “friends” than ever, but we lack the deep bonding we yearn for.</p><p>The problem isn’t just anecdotal. In 2014, the National Science Foundation reported in its General Social Survey that an unprecedented number of Americans are lonely. Almost one fourth of respondents reported having “no one with whom they can talk about their personal troubles or triumphs.”</p><p>One solution is developing a support group – a group of people that you meet with regularly to reflect, share, and support each other. We know these groups are important, but it’s difficult to change how we behave. As CEO Tad Piper explained in Discover Your True North, “Many of us find excuses—I’m too busy . . . The payoff isn’t clear . . . I’ll do it next year—to avoid building the types of relationships these groups engender.”</p><p>If you look at the psychological research, however, the pay-off is clear. Developing a strong support network makes you happier, more productive, and better prepared to face the world.</p><p>Emotionally, having a strong support network changes how you feel. As the Mayo Clinic recently reported, deep personal connections help decrease stress, anxiety, and the risk of depression. Having close relationships changes your fundamental biology. In 2006, the Journal of Behavioral medicine reported that social support is linked to a lower rate of mortality and an improvement in the immune system.</p><p>Having a consistent group also helps you reflect on yourself. In preparing for the unexpected in life, leadership expert Warren Bennis says, “Have some group that will tell you the truth and to whom you can tell the truth… All you can do is make sure there’s some way of understanding reality beyond what you know yourself.”&nbsp; A strong support group allows you see yourself more clearly. The members provide feedback, perspective, and (at times) the difficult truth you need to hear.</p><p>Finally, your support group helps you develop a feeling of belonging. As Brene Brown at the University of Houston put it, “A deep sense of love and belonging is an irreducible need of all people. We are biologically, cognitively, physically, and spiritually wired to love, to be loved, and to belong. When those needs are not met, we don’t function as we were meant to.”&nbsp; Developing a consistent group of peers you can be vulnerable with is essential in this process.</p><p>At various times your support group – something I call a True North Group –&nbsp; will function as a nurturer, a grounding rod, a truth teller, and a mirror. At other times the group functions as a challenger or an inspirer. When people are wracked with self-doubts, it helps build their courage and ability to cope.”</p><p>We do not succeed on their own.&nbsp; Our collective loneliness has been well documented, but the remedies have not. Authentic leaders build close relationships with people who will counsel them in times of uncertainty, be there in times of difficulty, and celebrate with them in times of success.</p><p>How strong is your support group? Who do you have… when you’re alone?</p>"

      "<p>From Matt McKinney<strong>&nbsp;</strong>for <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/publicly-financed-mayo-project-slow-to-draw-private-investment/337330091/\">StarTribune</a>, posted October 27, 2015</p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/publicly-financed-mayo-project-slow-to-draw-private-investment/337330091/\">StarTribune</a><p><em>The city has little to show for the hoopla that surrounded the Legislature’s $585 million assist in Mayo’s plan to remake Rochester into an international center for medicine, research and health care.&nbsp;</em></p><em>The city has little to show for the hoopla that surrounded the Legislature’s $585 million assist in Mayo’s plan to remake Rochester into an international center for medicine, research and health care.&nbsp;</em><p><strong>ROCHESTER</strong>&nbsp;– It’s been two years and five months since Mayo Clinic CEO John Noseworthy stood before a cheering crowd here to celebrate a massive $6 billion redo of the clinic and the city.</p><strong>ROCHESTER</strong><p>For some, what’s happened since has been a whole lot of waiting for the magic to start.</p><p>“There’s a little bit of, ‘Where’s the beef?’ ” said City Council Member Michael Wojcik.</p><p>The city has little to show for the hoopla that surrounded the Legislature’s $585 million assist in Mayo’s plan to remake Rochester into an international center for medicine, research and health care.</p><p>The first two Destination Medical Center (DMC) projects could come together soon: The city will likely close next month on a $6 million deal to buy a historic downtown theater, preserving the stately structure for an as-yet undetermined use; and a 23-floor, privately funded Hilton could break ground in January in the heart of downtown.</p><p>Still, DMC planners likely won’t reach the $200 million in private investment needed to trigger the state funding until 2017 ­— four years after legislative approval.</p><p>The project’s pace recently drew the attention of former Medtronic CEO Bill George, who sits on the Destination Medical Center Corporation board. At its most recent meeting, George said it’s time to “get down to specifics and build momentum.</p><p>“We need to see something visible,” he said.</p><p>Those words cheered developer Sean Allen, who said he’s been frustrated by DMC’s speed. “This has been an idea and something that’s been floating around for four or five years now, and it’s still just a concept,” he said. “Bill George is right, you have to actually do something.”</p><p>Billed as a needed step to keep Mayo competitive with world-class medical centers, DMC blends private investment with public tax dollars to fuel rapid growth. Mayo would extend its campus and medical know-how with $3.5 billion in investments over the DMC’s 20-year life span, while private investors would add another $2.1 billion in residential, retail and commercial investments. The $585 million in tax money would build the infrastructure to make Rochester a destination in its own right.</p><p>The plan calls for adding up to 45,000 jobs to Rochester, nearly doubling its population and adding billions in state tax revenue.</p><p>Allen’s company, Midwest Landing, plans to break ground in the spring on a luxury apartment building across the river from Rochester’s Mayo Park. A second project, a nine-story office building, might break ground next year, he said.</p><p>Despite months of public meetings and strategic planning, Allen said he’s worried that not everyone is on board. The City Council in a recent meeting nearly approved construction of a one-story bank with a surface parking lot on a vital piece of riverfront land, a move at odds with the DMC vision for the space. Meanwhile, a new four-story affordable housing project announced last week will sit in an area the DMC plan had reserved for transit.</p><p>“It needs to be something we’re trying to accomplish as a community,” said Allen.</p><p>The DMC project was pushed as a 20-year plan, a fact that Jeff Bolton, Mayo Clinic vice president and chief administrative officer, stressed in a recent interview.</p><p>“We continually have to remind folks that this is a 20-year project,” Bolton said. Mayo has made $46 million of certified DMC investments so far, and is on pace to invest $3.5 billion over 20 years, he said.</p><p>The project hasn’t certified any private investment so far, but Bolton said that, as far as private companies looking to commit to Rochester, “we probably have four or five in discussion right now.”</p><p><strong>Pushing ahead</strong></p><strong>Pushing ahead</strong><p>Still unpacking in their new downtown office, the five-member staff of the DMC Economic Development Authority (EDA) has been charged with marketing and launching the project. Most of the staffers were hired in the past three months. Executive director Lisa Clarke said she took Bill George’s comments to mean she should “stay focused.”</p><p>“So, no dawdling,” she said last week. “It’s go time.”</p><p>Her staff will build something they’re calling a dashboard to chart progress, including such metrics as building permits, jobs and changes to median income.</p><p>The EDA will adjust the plan every five years, Clarke said, asking things like, “What’s the right pace?</p><p>“Now we’re in the private phase; we have to get private developers in,” she said.</p><p>The city has contributed $19.9 million of its required $128 million commitment, including $14.4 million for a city parking ramp on the Broadway at Center project and $5.5 million for the purchase of the Chateau Theater.</p><p>Clarke’s office has been tracking 14 privately funded projects worth at least $420 million that are likely to take place within the DMC district. It’s likely that the projects will push private investment in DMC beyond $200 million by 2017, unlocking the pledged taxpayer dollars, said Patrick Seeb, the EDA’s economic development director.</p><p>DMC board member R.T. Rybak said progress has been made, but it’s in the behind-the-scenes negotiations. He said it’s unlike the Vikings stadium, which was approved a year before DMC and whose exterior is largely finished.</p><p>DMC is “in a quiet phase right now,” the former Minneapolis mayor said. “That’s the way that field has to work.”</p><p>The DMCC board chair, Lt. Gov. Tina Smith, said, “My sense is that you’re going to see incremental progress during the course of the entire 20 years.”</p>"

Its stock price makes Alibaba the eighteenth-largest global company by market capitalization. Ma’s goal isn’t making money. Because of Alibaba’s success, he is already China’s wealthiest citizen, with a $20 billion net worth. Yet when he asked his wife whether it was more important to be wealthy or have respect, they agreed upon respect.</p><p>In person, Ma is warm, affable, open, and authentic. For all his success, he is extremely humble, preferring to talk about building a great company that helps customers, creates jobs, and serves society. “I’m just a purist. I don’t spend 15 minutes thinking about making money,” he said. “What is important in my life is influencing many people as well as China’s development. When I am by myself, I am relaxed and happy.” He added, “They call me ‘Crazy Jack.’ I hope to stay crazy for the next 30 years.”</p><p>China’s large and growing economy has made it an increasing economic force the past two decades, but it has not produced global companies. Instead, Chinese businesses have focused domestically and engaged in low-cost production for international companies. Ma has a very different approach. He sees the Internet as a worldwide phenomenon that knows no borders. Today, the Alibaba companies serve 600 million customers in 240 countries. Ma intends to expand aggressively in the American, European, and emerging markets by linking 1 million small businesses with 2 billion Asian consumers. He also has plans to disrupt China’s commercial banking and insurance sectors.</p><p><em>“I want to create one million jobs, change China’s social and economic environment, and make it the largest Internet market in the world.” –Jack Ma</em></p><em>“I want to create one million jobs, change China’s social and economic environment, and make it the largest Internet market in the world.” –Jack Ma</em><p>In the times I have been with him, Ma relishes telling his life story. Raised in humble origins in Hangzhou in the 1980s, he overcame one obstacle after another. He was rejected at virtually every school he applied to, even grade schools, because he didn’t test well in math.</p><p>Yet he persevered. From ages 12 to 20, he rode his bicycle 40 minutes to a hotel where he could practice his English. “China was opening up, and a lot of foreign tourists went there,” he said. “I showed them around as a free guide. Those eight years changed me deeply, as I became more globalized than most Chinese. What foreign visitors told us was different from what I learned from my teachers and books.”</p><p>As a young man, Ma applied for jobs at 30 companies and was rejected at every one. He seemed most stung by his experience at Kentucky Fried Chicken where 24 people applied and 23 got jobs. Ma was the only applicant rejected. Consequently, he became an English teacher at Hangzhou Electronics Technology College. When he visited America for the first time in 1999, he was stunned by the entrepreneurial culture he saw in California. “I got my dream from America,” he said. “In the evenings in Silicon Valley, the roads were full of cars, and all the buildings had lights on. That’s the vision of what I wanted to create [at home in China].”</p><p>Returning to Hangzhou, he and Joe Tsai (now executive vice chair) founded Alibaba in Ma’s modest apartment. “We chose the name,” he explained, “because people everywhere associate it with ‘Open, Sesame,’ the command Ali Baba used to open doors to hidden treasures in One Thousand and One Nights.” Ma focused on applying his team’s ideas to help businesses and consumers find their own hidden treasures. He was unsuccessful in raising even $2 million from American venture capitalists, but, once again, he persevered. Eventually, he raised $5 million through Goldman Sachs, and later, Masayoshi Son of Japan’s SoftBank invested $20 million.</p><p>Ma is passionate about building the Alibaba ecosystem in order to help people, a philosophy that he is trying to embed into the DNA of the company. At the company’s founding, he issued generous stock option packages to early employees because he wanted to enrich their lives. The day of the IPO, he insisted Alibaba’s six values–Customer First, Teamwork, Embrace Change, Integrity, Passion, Commitment–be placed on the pillars of the New York Stock Exchange.</p><p>Ma’s commitment to a cause larger than himself has propelled him forward.</p><p><em>My vision is to build an e-commerce ecosystem that allows consumers and businesses to do all aspects of business online. I want to create one million jobs, change China’s social and economic environment, and make it the largest Internet market in the world.</em></p><em>My vision is to build an e-commerce ecosystem that allows consumers and businesses to do all aspects of business online. I want to create one million jobs, change China’s social and economic environment, and make it the largest Internet market in the world.</em><p>American tech leaders, such as Larry Page of Google and Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, have emphasized technology and product above everything. Not Ma. “I’m not a tech guy,” he said. “I’m looking at technology with the eyes of my customers—normal people’s eyes.”</p><p>With his light-hearted nature, Ma participates in annual talent shows where he sings pop songs. He also practices Tai Chi and martial arts, which he calls “the most down-to-earth way of explaining Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism. These practices cherish brotherhood, morality, courage, emotion, and conscience.”</p><p>Ma worries that China lost an entire generation when Mao Zedong phased out Confucianism and other forms of spirituality. His bold vision is to restore that sense of values and purpose to the next generation. “It’s not policies we need, but genuine people,” he said. Ma is highly ethical in his business practices. He noted, “I would rather shut down my company than pay a bribe.”</p><p>For all his confidence, Ma is not without worries. He believes his biggest challenges are to create genuine value for his customers, to work cooperatively with the government, and to build his team of global leaders. He would like to use his wealth to found a university for entrepreneurs that can produce the next generation of Chinese entrepreneurs. “Our challenge,” Ma said, “is to help more people to make money in a sustainable manner. That is not only good for them but also good for society.”</p><p><em>“Ma embodies the global intelligence, or GQ, that is needed for today’s global leaders.” –Bill George</em></p><em>“Ma embodies the global intelligence, or GQ, that is needed for today’s global leaders.” –Bill George</em><p><strong>Developing Global Intelligence (GQ)</strong></p><strong>Developing Global Intelligence (GQ)</strong><p>Ma embodies the global intelligence, or GQ, that is needed for today’s global leaders. Succeeding in the new global context will require companies to cultivate a cadre of executives—as many as 500 per company—who have the capabilities of global leaders. Developing these new leaders requires unique leadership experiences, ideally in emerging markets, combined with leadership development programs that differ materially from today’s corporate training programs. Traditionally, the latter have focused on managerial skills and building one’s functional knowledge. Yet the shortcomings of leaders—and their subsequent failures—usually result from the lack of leadership capabilities that we call global intelligence, or GQ.</p><p>GQ consists of seven elements, all of which are essential for global leaders:</p><ul>\n<li>Adaptability</li>\n<li>Awareness</li>\n<li>Curiosity</li>\n<li>Empathy</li>\n<li>Alignment</li>\n<li>Collaboration</li>\n<li>Integration</li>\n</ul><li>Adaptability</li><li>Awareness</li><li>Curiosity</li><li>Empathy</li><li>Alignment</li><li>Collaboration</li><li>Integration</li><p>Several of these characteristics—such as awareness—seem very similar to parts of the process we’ve examined for discovering your True North. That’s by design. Global interactions heighten the stress that leaders face. The more global the context, the more demanding leadership becomes. When leaders are placed in emerging market situations, the complexity increases exponentially because the differences in language, culture, customer preferences, negotiating tactics, business practices, laws, and ethical standards are so great. The same applies to the activities of daily living in these countries. That’s why many otherwise solid leaders struggle with global assignments and working in emerging markets.</p><p>Let’s examine each of these characteristics of global leaders.</p><p><strong>Adaptability</strong></p><strong>Adaptability</strong><p>Being a global leader requires the ability to understand today’s volatile world and foresee changes coming in the years ahead. Global leaders must be able to adapt quickly to the rapidly changing global context by shifting resources to opportunity areas and developing contingency plans to cope with adverse geopolitical situations.</p><p>This is particularly true in emerging markets, where frequent changes in government, currency movements, financial crises, ethnic conflicts, wars, and terrorism may literally change the business climate overnight. In recent years, we have seen this happen in Greece, Egypt, Iraq, Pakistan, Ukraine, Russia, and India, to mention just a few. Global leaders must be prepared to alter their tactics quickly to adjust to changes.</p><p><strong>Awareness</strong></p><strong>Awareness</strong><p>Leaders need to understand the world around them, as well as themselves—their strengths, vulnerabilities, and biases—to perceive how they will react to the significant cultural differences they encounter. When people from developed countries live in emerging markets, they become much more aware of themselves and their insecurities as they begin to understand the complexities of other languages, being in the minority, and differences in cultures and norms.</p><p><em>“One of the greatest challenges global leaders face is incorporating local and global issues into an integrated corporate strategy.” –Bill George</em></p><em>“One of the greatest challenges global leaders face is incorporating local and global issues into an integrated corporate strategy.” –Bill George</em><p><strong>Curiosity</strong></p><strong>Curiosity</strong><p>Global leaders must have deep curiosity about the cultures they encounter. This includes a personal passion for diverse experiences and an insatiable desire to learn from other cultures. They also must be humble to recognize that different cultural norms and ways of doing things guiding other cultures may often be superior to their own. When you visit an emerging market, such as China or India, do you stay in a deluxe hotel and eat in Western restaurants, or do you get out into the country, meet the people, go to local markets and shops, and visit people’s homes to see how they live? That marks the difference between domestic leaders traveling overseas and global leaders who are open to experiencing all the world has to offer.</p><p><strong>Empathy</strong></p><strong>Empathy</strong><p>Empathy is the ability to walk in someone else’s shoes. This requires humility and the capability to engage people from different cultures personally, rather than standing back and judging them. Empathy builds rapport and bonding and creates lasting relationships. Only with empathy are leaders able to draw the highest level of engagement from colleagues from different cultures and empower them to achieve exceptional performance.</p><p><strong>Alignment</strong></p><strong>Alignment</strong><p>The challenge for global leaders is to align all employees around the company’s mission and its values, a commitment that transcends national and cultural differences. Achieving alignment is far more difficult in a global context because the business practices and ethics in emerging markets often differ so dramatically from those of developed countries. Thus, global leaders are asking local employees to put the company’s mission and values ahead of the business practices and values in countries where they have grown up and worked. It is no longer sufficient just to comply with the laws and ethics without regard for negative consequences their business practices may have on the countries in which they operate. However, this does not mean giving up their culture and the norms by which they live, because norms can vary widely from country to country.</p><p><strong>Collaboration</strong></p><strong>Collaboration</strong><p>In a global context, collaboration is the ability to create horizontal networks that cut across geographic lines, bring people together around common goals, and create a modus operandi that transcends geographic norms. In authentic global collaborations, participants put company and project goals first and work together in partnerships to achieve them. The most successful geographic collaborations are led by global leaders who know the strengths and weaknesses of each regional group and who make assignments within the team to take advantage of their relative strengths.</p><p><strong>Integration</strong></p><strong>Integration</strong><p>One of the greatest challenges global leaders face is incorporating local and global issues into an integrated corporate strategy. Such a strategy enables them to optimize their position in a wide array of local markets efficiently to create sustainable competitive advantage. Doing so requires deep understanding of local markets and the global vision to see how their companies can serve their customers’ needs in a superior manner by leveraging their corporate strengths. That’s the only way they can outcompete local companies, which often have a cost advantage because they operate in the region.</p><p>As Unilever’s COO Harish Manwani explained, “We have a globally distributed organizational model that balances local relevance with obal leverage.”</p><p><em>We don’t believe in “Think local; act global.” Instead, we believe in “Act local; think global.” The company starts by acting locally, creating relevance through an understanding of consumer needs and desires and their local cultures. Then we leverage Unilever’s vast global resources to deliver superior products to meet those needs. This is how we gain competitive advantage over local producers. We are committed to bringing our expertise to local markets.</em></p><em>We don’t believe in “Think local; act global.” Instead, we believe in “Act local; think global.” The company starts by acting locally, creating relevance through an understanding of consumer needs and desires and their local cultures.

When you give someone else the power to decide if you’re successful (whether it’s the Forbes 400 list or an invitation to Davos), you lose. If you allow some external force to define your success, you have essentially abdicated your soul.</p><p>There is a deep voice inside you that yearns to bring your unique gifts to this world.

Born before the 1863 Emancipation Proclamation, Frazier’s grandfather was a slave in South Carolina. He sent his son, Frazier’s father, to live in Philadelphia. With no formal education, Frazier’s father became a janitor, yet taught himself to read, reading two newspapers a day. In spite of his limited opportunities, he had a profound influence on Frazier’s life.</p><p>After his mother died when he was 12, Frazier and his sisters had to fend for themselves after school, avoiding the gangs that dominated the streets outside his house. “I learned very early from my father that one has to be one’s own person and not go along with the crowd,” Frazier says. His father asked him, “Kenny, how are you going to carry on your grandfather’s narrative of being free and your own person? You better do what you know is right, and not be fixated on what other people think of you.”</p><p>While studying at on Penn State scholarship, Frazier decided he wanted “to become a great lawyer like Thurgood Marshall, affecting social change.” At Harvard Law School, he was acutely aware he wasn’t from the same social class as his classmates. He wryly notes, “Lloyd Blankfein [CEO of Goldman Sachs] and I were the only students who ‘were not of the manor born.’”</p><p>Shortly after he joined Merck, Frazier took on the extremely difficult task of defending Merck from over 40,000 lawsuits filed after the pain drug Vioxx was withdrawn from the market due to alleged cardiovascular problems. Frazier did so successfully, catapulting him into the CEO’s chair where he faced a greater challenge: short-term shareholders pressured him to cut back Merck’s research as several of its competitors were doing. Frazier stayed the course, committing to spend a minimum of $8 billion per year on research in order to pursue cures for devastating diseases like cancer and Alzheimer’s.</p><p>Reflecting on his sense of purpose, Frazier explains,&nbsp;“Merck’s purpose is&nbsp;aligned with my personal sense of who I want to be and what I hope to contribute to the world. At Merck, you have the opportunity to make tangible contributions to humanity. There’s a yearning in all of us to leave something meaningful behind, because we know we have a short time on earth. Merck gives me the chance to leave something to people 20, 50 or even 100 years from now because we did the right things today.”</p><p>Asked what his father would say about his remarkable success, Frazier says modestly, “He’d say, ‘The boy did what he was supposed to do.’”</p><p><strong>Turning Purpose Into Action&nbsp;</strong></p><strong>Turning Purpose Into Action&nbsp;</strong><p>Your leadership purpose is not meaningful until it is applied to solving problems you encounter in the real world. When you align your personal purpose with an organization’s mission, you unlock the full potential of people in the organization.</p><p>That’s what I tried to do at Medtronic where we connected employees’ True North with the company mission of “restoring health, alleviating pain and extending life.” My successors, especially current CEO Omar Ishrak, have pursued this mission with vigor, contributing to the 100 times increase in the company’s market value over the past 26 years. More importantly, the number of people each year restored to full health has grown from 300,000 to 15 million.</p><p>As long as you focus on&nbsp;<em>your</em>&nbsp;True North, understand your purpose and use it to make a difference in the world, you can leave a legacy that inspires those who follow.</p><em>your</em>"

      "<p>From&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-george/lessons-from-volkswagen-a_b_8284884.html\">Huffington Post</a>&nbsp;on Oct. 12, 2015&nbsp;</p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-george/lessons-from-volkswagen-a_b_8284884.html\">Huffington Post</a><p><em>“Without a moral center, you will swim in chaos” — James Burke, Former Johnson &amp; Johnson CEO</em></p><em>“Without a moral center, you will swim in chaos” — James Burke, Former Johnson &amp; Johnson CEO</em><p>The Volkswagen scandal hit new lows this week when German-born Michael Horn, CEO of Volkswagen America, refused to acknowledge the people responsible for falsifying emissions tests on 11 million vehicles or to release essential documents. In front of the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce, he chose instead to blame lower-level engineers.</p><p>Does anyone really believe a scandal of this magnitude and scope was actually masterminded by a few engineers? In my experience, it would be highly unlikely for first-level engineers to take the risks inherent in such an illegal scheme and even more improbable that their superiors knew nothing about it, especially in a hierarchical organization like Volkswagen.</p><p>Unfortunately, this kind of dissembling and cover-up has become all too common in corporate circles. It only serves to harm ethical companies as the public loses trust in all corporate leaders.<br>It’s been a bad year for organization ethics. In September United Airlines’ CEO Jeff Smisek was forced to resign for cutting unethical deals with the head of the Port Authority for New York and New Jersey. Toshiba’s top officials admitted to seven years of corrupt accounting. Even the soccer world was rocked when FIFA’s executive committee acknowledged that corruption had reached its highest levels, and suspended president Sepp Blatter, right-hand man Jerome Valcke, and European head Michel Platini.</p><br><p>What should organizations do when the organization is corrupt from the top down? In my new book,&nbsp;<em>Discover Your True North</em>, I address how essential it is for leaders at the top to set standards for the entire organization. Yet all too often, people on the lowest rungs of the ladder are fired or blamed for illegal activities, while the bosses protect themselves. Even when forced to resign, they walk away with large termination settlements. For example, United’s Smisek received nearly $20 million in termination pay after his corrupt dealings with public officials were exposed.</p><em>Discover Your True North</em><p>Every organization needs clear values that establish its principles and set firm ethical boundaries on its actions. Confronted by the 1980s Tylenol crisis, in which lethal poison was placed in Tylenol pills, former Johnson &amp; Johnson CEO James Burke used his company’s famous Credo to guide his actions. He observed, “Without a moral center, you will swim in chaos.”</p><p>Employees encounter many gray areas in their work. They need clarity about where to draw the line between acceptable and unacceptable actions. That’s what IBM’s CEO Sam Palmisano established after becoming CEO. He shifted IBM’s entire 440,000 person organization – which operates in many countries where corruption is the norm — to “Leading by Values.”</p><p>Former Citigroup CFO Sallie Krawcheck took a heroic action when she insisted on refunding losses to clients misled by her firm during the 2008 financial crisis. She bluntly asserted Citi broke clients’ trust by pushing low-risk alternative investments that were actually high risk. When CEO Vikram Pandit vehemently disagreed, Krawcheck took her argument directly to Citi’s board of directors, which backed her actions. A miffed Pandit later fired her. Krawcheck knew she could always get a job, but she recognized she couldn’t recover her values.</p><p>But what can be done when organizations like FIFA and Volkswagen are corrupt at the top? The only solution is to clean house at the highest levels of the organization and weed out the poison in the system. Otherwise, the organization will ultimately revert to its unethical practices.</p><p>That’s what Germany’s Siemens did when audits revealed it paid out $1.8 billion in bribes. Board chair Heinrich von Pierer, who presided over the unethical dealings as CEO, was forced to resign. Board chair Gerhard Cromme and CEO Peter Loescher were brought in to clean up the mess. To their credit, they squarely faced the issues, terminating the company’s entire executive committee and firing 400 top executives. A new governance and compliance system was established, and all employees went through extensive compliance training. It cost the firm $2.7 billion in fines and legal fees, but now Siemens is operating ethically throughout the world and has been restored to full health.</p><p>FIFA and Volkswagen would be wise to follow Siemens’ approach of bringing in outsiders to address their scandals, with outsiders leading the board and executive management. Their actions should include hiring new law firms and accountants to conduct independent investigations, and terminate anyone who is directly or indirectly involved with corrupt dealings. In FIFA’s case, this may include current members of its governing board involved in the corruption.<br>Leaders should always put the institution first. Instead, all too often organizations protect individuals until they are “proven” guilty, as Blatter’s attorney is arguing FIFA should do. It is far better to separate them completely from the organization, and let the courts determine criminal culpability.</p><br><p>Finally, transparency is essential: the board should reveal all the findings of its legal and accounting reports and make them public immediately. It is far better for the board to reveal them rather than waiting for political bodies, the media, or the courts to extract this information. By vigorously investigating its own actions and transparently sharing the findings, the organization begins to rebuild the credibility necessary to return to business.</p><p>Only through aggressive, transparent actions can corrupt organizations be restored to fulfill their missions.</p>"

The losing of self entirely to the cooperative effort of the crew.” — George Yeoman Pocock, boatbuilder, 1936 Olympic gold medal winner</em></p><em>“Where is the spiritual value in rowing? The losing of self entirely to the cooperative effort of the crew.” — George Yeoman Pocock, boatbuilder, 1936 Olympic gold medal winner</em><p>Stepping into a Zappos call center is like walking into a circus. Phones ring, voices rise, and laughter bounces around the room. If you closed your eyes, you’d think you’d entered a loud family reunion, not a billion dollar company.</p><p>Zappos employees work in a fiercely proud culture. Only 16 years after founding Zappos, CEO Tony Hsieh has made the online shoe-retailer into one of best places to work in the world. Zappos employees not only love their work, they care deeply about others in the community.</p><p>How did Hsieh do it? By empowering his employees to lead.</p><p>In Eyewitness to Power, David Gergen writes, “At the heart of leadership is the leader’s relationship with followers. People will entrust their hopes and dreams to another person only if they think the other is a reliable vessel.”</p><p>There was a time when leaders thought their role was to exert power over others. No longer. Today’s best leaders — people like Ford’s Alan Mulally, General Motors’ Mary Barra, and Google’s Larry Page — recognize their leadership is most effective when they empower others to step up and lead. That’s exactly what the new generation of Gen X and Millennials expect from their leaders, and they respond with great performance.</p><p>Tony Hsieh focuses on relationships first and business second. In good times and bad, Hsieh’s communications are authentic, funny, and informal. He speaks directly and personally to his colleagues. As Hsieh says “if you get the culture right, most of the other stuff…will just happen naturally.”</p><p>Hsieh reflects traits of an “empowering leader.” These leaders have discovered that helping people find purpose delivers superior results than forcing subordinates to be loyal followers. By giving others the latitude to lead, they expand their own potential impact.</p><p>So, how can you empower others? In Discover Your True North, I profile five things great leaders do.</p><p>1. Treat Others as Equals<br>\n2. Listen Actively<br>\n3. Learn From People<br>\n4. Share Life Stories<br>\n5. Align Around the Mission</p><br><br><br><br><p>Treat Others as Equals<br>\nWe respect people who treat us as equals. Warren Buffett, for example, gives equal attention to every person he meets. He has the same sandwich and Cherry Coke combination with a group of wide-eyed students as he does with his close friend Bill Gates. Buffett does not rely upon his image to make people feel he is important or powerful. He genuinely respects others, and they respect him as much for those qualities as for his investment prowess. By being authentic in his interactions, Buffett empowers people to lead in their own authentic way.</p><br><p>Listen Actively<br>\nWe are grateful when people genuinely listen to us. Active listening is one of the most important abilities of empowering leaders, because people sense such individuals are genuinely interested in them and not just trying to get something. The leadership scholar Warren Bennis was an example of a world-class listener. He patiently listened as you explained your ideas and then thoughtfully contributed astute observations that came from a deep well of wisdom and experience.</p><br><p>Learn from People<br>\nWe feel respected when others believe they can learn from us or ask for our advice. The best advice I ever got about teaching came from my Harvard Business School (HBS) colleague Paul Marshall, who was one of HBS’s greatest teachers. He told me, “Bill, don’t ever set foot in an HBS classroom unless you genuinely want to learn from the students.” I have taken his advice into every class I have taught for the past 12 years, telling MBA students and executives, “I feel certain I will learn a lot more from you than you do from me.” The students find that hard to believe at first, but they soon see how their feedback helps me understand how today’s leaders and MBA students think.</p><br><p>Share Life Stories<br>\nWhen leaders are willing to be open and share their personal stories and vulnerabilities, people feel empowered to share their own stories and uncertainties in return. On Thanksgiving eve in 1996, I sent an e-mail to all Medtronic employees, expressing my gratitude for the support Penny and I received following her ordeal with breast cancer and chemotherapy. We were overwhelmed by the number of people who spontaneously shared their stories with us.</p><br><p>Align Around the Mission<br>\nThe most empowering condition of all is when the entire organization aligns with its mission, and people’s passions and purpose synchronize with each other. It is not easy to get to this position, especially if the organization has a significant number of cynics or disgruntled people. Nonetheless, it is worth whatever effort it takes to create an aligned environment, including removal of those who don’t support the mission.</p><br><p>Leaders of every organization have an important responsibility to articulate how their company contributes to humankind. At Medtronic, our mission was to restore people to full health and wellness. At Disney, it’s to make people happy. Even at the most “boring” business-to-business company, the business can play a powerful role in improving the lives of its stakeholders – customers, employees, suppliers, and community.</p><p>With leadership comes responsibility. As Clayton Christensen wrote, “No other occupation offers as many ways to help others learn and grow, take responsibility and be recognized for achievement.”</p><p>It’s time to lead authentically. You can do so by focusing on empowering others.</p><p>A team of empowered leaders all rowing in the same direction is hard to beat.</p>"

Yet remarkably, Buffett has no qualms about sharing the “secrets” to his success. For example, in his latest&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2014ltr.pdf\">letter</a>&nbsp;to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders released in February 2015, Buffett reflected on investing lessons he and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger learned during the last 50 years leading the firm, offering tactical pieces of advice relevant to investors at all sizes and stages.</p><a href=\"http://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2014ltr.pdf\">letter</a><p>So when one of the most successful investors of all time so openly gives you a glimpse into the inner workings of his success, you’d be wise to pay attention. But why do most other funds ignore Buffett’s investing strategies despite their successful track records?</p><p>In my view, a great deal of this is explained by incentive misalignment between hedge fund and activist investors who are investing other people’s money for large fees and short-term gains, versus Buffett who charges no fees to his investors and invests 99 percent of his wealth alongside them. While some hedge funds make it big in the short-term, they usually cannot sustain their success. It seems to explain why all the pressure from traders, hedge funds, and their academic partners is on the short-term gains — which ultimately led to the 2008 financial collapse.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway’s success is due, in part, to Buffett’s willingness to avoid playing the short-term financial game. Buffett has said that his preferred holding period is forever. In the 2015 letter to shareholders, Munger wrote that Buffett would “deploy most cash not needed in subsidiaries after they had increased their competitive advantage, with the ideal deployment being the use of that cash to acquire new subsidiaries.” In short, Buffett did not want cash back from a business until it had both increased its competitive advantage and considered good-fit strategic acquisitions.</p><p>On Wall Street, where failure to produce short-term results often leads to termination, Buffett has been able to rise above this pressure to build a transparent, values-based company dedicated to upholding the highest levels of business ethics and personal integrity. How? Buffett operates in his “sweet spot,” a term I describe in my new book<em><a href=\"http://www.discoveryourtruenorth.org/\">Discover Your True North</a></em>&nbsp;as the intersection of one’s extrinsic and intrinsic motivations and greatest strengths.</p><em><a href=\"http://www.discoveryourtruenorth.org/\">Discover Your True North</a></em><a href=\"http://www.discoveryourtruenorth.org/\">Discover Your True North</a><p><a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-09-25-1443191403-1635141-Figure6.2.png\"></a></p><a href=\"http://images.huffingtonpost.com/2015-09-25-1443191403-1635141-Figure6.2.png\"></a><p>Claremont professor and pioneer in psychology Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, has given the following advice about motivation: “Find out what you are good at and what you like to do.” When you uncover opportunities that appeal to your motivations and utilize your strengths, you discover your sweet spot and will be most effective as a leader. Buffett’s success lies in a conscious decision to design his life to take advantage of his strengths and focus on his motivations. Clearly, Buffett’s strength is investing. His passion for the trade began when he was a young child. At the age of 11, Buffett made his first stock investment in three shares of Cities Service Preferred at $38 a share. Despite the stock dropping quickly to $27, Buffett held on and sold when the stock reached $40.</p><p>In his first full-time job as a stockbroker, Buffett felt conflicted because he could only generate commissions by pushing clients to trade actively, even when it was against their best interest. Rather than learning the tricks of the trade, Buffett invested his time in learning how to fundamentally analyze stocks. In 1954, Buffett took a position as apprentice to&nbsp;<em>The Intelligent Investor</em>&nbsp;author Benjamin Graham, without even asking the salary. When Graham decided to retire two years later, Buffett returned to his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska to open his own investing firm at the age of 26. This bold move positioned Buffett at the intersection of his motivations and his greatest strengths — his sweet spot.</p><em>The Intelligent Investor</em><p>&nbsp;Extrinsically, Buffett is motivated by being valued and gaining public recognition that allows him to raise his profile and gain access to deals. He is not motivated by material possessions. He still lives in the Omaha house he bought for $31,500 in 1956, eats simple meals at his favorite restaurant Gorat’s, and drives a 2014 Cadillac XTS that he bought after he sold his 2006 Cadillac DTS in a charity auction. Intrinsically, Buffett is motivated by learning and sharing his knowledge, as evidenced by his candid and educational Berkshire Hathaway letters to shareholders.</p><p>As a result of Buffett’s philosophy, Berkshire Hathaway’s returns have more than doubled the S&amp;P 500 Index for the past 40 years. To put that success in context, Buffett has created twice the shareholder value of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley combined with 24 people in a 5,000 square foot office in Omaha.</p><p>Buffett asks his partners, “Do you love the business, or do you love the money?” He only wants those who love the business.</p>"

As Dan McAdams, Northwestern University psychology professor, explains, “The stories we tell ourselves about our lives don’t just shape our personalities –- they&nbsp;are&nbsp;our personalities. ”</p><p>Your narrative identity is the story of your life; but it’s more than just a story. How you understand&nbsp;your narrative frames both your current actions and your future&nbsp;<a title=\"Psychology Today looks at goals\" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/motivation\">goals</a>. As research from Southern Methodist University shows, writing about difficult life experiences improves our physical and mental&nbsp;<a title=\"Psychology Today looks at health\" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/health\">health</a>. How much you confront your life’s challenges – what I call “crucibles” – defines your level of self-awareness.&nbsp;</p><a title=\"Psychology Today looks at goals\" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/motivation\">goals</a><a title=\"Psychology Today looks at health\" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/health\">health</a><p>So, how can you begin? In Discover Your True North, I give a few questions to start.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at your early life story, what people, events, and experiences have had the greatest impact in shaping the person you have become?<br>In which experiences did you find the greatest passion for leading?<br>How do you frame your crucibles and setbacks in your life?</p><br><br><p><strong>2. Create a Daily Habit of Self-reflection&nbsp;</strong></p><strong>2. Create a Daily Habit of Self-reflection&nbsp;</strong><p>Next, you should develop a daily practice of setting aside at least twenty minutes to reflect on your life. This practice enables you to focus on the important things in your life, not just the immediate. Research from Wisconsin’s&nbsp;Richard Davidson demonstrated direct correlation between&nbsp;<a title=\"Psychology Today looks at mindfulness\" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/mindfulness\">mindfulness</a>&nbsp;and changes in the&nbsp;<a title=\"Psychology Today looks at brain\" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/neuroscience\">brain</a>&nbsp;– away from&nbsp;<a title=\"Psychology Today looks at anger\" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/anger\">anger</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title=\"Psychology Today looks at anxiety \" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/anxiety\">anxiety</a>and toward a sense of calm and well-being.</p><a title=\"Psychology Today looks at mindfulness\" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/mindfulness\">mindfulness</a><a title=\"Psychology Today looks at brain\" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/neuroscience\">brain</a><a title=\"Psychology Today looks at anger\" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/anger\">anger</a><a title=\"Psychology Today looks at anxiety \" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/anxiety\">anxiety</a><p>Reflection takes many forms. Some keep a journal, some pray, and others take a long walk or jog. Personally, I use daily&nbsp;<a title=\"Psychology Today looks at meditation\" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/meditation\">meditation</a>&nbsp;as my mindful habit.&nbsp;By centering into myself, I am able to focus my attention on what’s really important, and develop an inner sense of well-being.</p><a title=\"Psychology Today looks at meditation\" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/meditation\">meditation</a><p><strong>3.Seek Honest Feedback</strong></p><strong>3.Seek Honest Feedback</strong><p>We all have traits that others see, but we are unable to see in ourselves. We call these “blind spots.” Do you see yourself as others see you? If not, you can address these blind spots by receiving honest feedback from people you trust.</p><p>Receiving feedback is hard. So, focus on psychological triggers that might block your learning. As Harvard’s Sheila Heen argued in “Thanks for The Feedback”, three main triggers prevent our learning: relationship triggers, identity triggers, and truth triggers. If you feel defensive, think back to&nbsp;why you do. Often, we can explain it using these triggers.&nbsp;</p><p>Becoming self-aware won’t happen in a day. Rather, it will take years of reflection, introspection, and difficult conversations.&nbsp;As you follow these three practices, you will find you are more comfortable being open, transparent, and even vulnerable. As you do, you will become a more authentic&nbsp;<a title=\"Psychology Today looks at leader \" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/leadership\">leader&nbsp;</a>and a more self-aware person.</p><a title=\"Psychology Today looks at leader \" href=\"https://www.psychologytoday.com/basics/leadership\">leader&nbsp;</a>"

It seems to explain why all the pressure from traders, hedge funds, and their academic partners is on the short-term gains — which ultimately led to the 2008 financial collapse.</p><p>Berkshire Hathaway’s success is due, in part, to Buffett’s willingness to avoid playing the short-term financial game. Buffett has said that his preferred holding period is forever. In the 2015 letter to shareholders, Munger wrote that Buffett would “deploy most cash not needed in subsidiaries after they had increased their competitive advantage, with the ideal deployment being the use of that cash to acquire new subsidiaries.” In short, Buffett did not want cash back from a business until it had both increased its competitive advantage and considered good-fit strategic acquisitions.</p><p>On Wall Street, where failure to produce short-term results often leads to termination, Buffett has been able to rise above this pressure to build a transparent, values-based company dedicated to upholding the highest levels of business ethics and personal integrity. How? Buffett operates in his “sweet spot,” a term I describe in my new book&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.discoveryourtruenorth.org/\">Discover Your True North</a></em>&nbsp;as the intersection of one’s extrinsic and intrinsic motivations and greatest strengths.</p><em><a href=\"http://www.discoveryourtruenorth.org/\">Discover Your True North</a></em><a href=\"http://www.discoveryourtruenorth.org/\">Discover Your True North</a><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Claremont professor and pioneer in psychology Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, has given the following advice about motivation: “Find out what you are good at and what you like to do.” When you uncover opportunities that appeal to your motivations and utilize your strengths, you discover your sweet spot and will be most effective as a leader. Buffett’s success lies in a conscious decision to design his life to take advantage of his strengths and focus on his motivations. Clearly, Buffett’s strength is investing. His passion for the trade began when he was a young child. At the age of 11, Buffett made his first stock investment in three shares of Cities Service Preferred at $38 a share. Despite the stock dropping quickly to $27, Buffett held on and sold when the stock reached $40.</p><p>In his first full-time job as a stockbroker, Buffett felt conflicted because he could only generate commissions by pushing clients to trade actively, even when it was against their best interest. Rather than learning the tricks of the trade, Buffett invested his time in learning how to fundamentally analyze stocks. In 1954, Buffett took a position as apprentice to&nbsp;<em>The Intelligent Investor</em>&nbsp;author Benjamin Graham, without even asking the salary. When Graham decided to retire two years later, Buffett returned to his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska to open his own investing firm at the age of 26. This bold move positioned Buffett at the intersection of his motivations and his greatest strengths — his sweet spot.</p><em>The Intelligent Investor</em><p>Extrinsically, Buffett is motivated by being valued and gaining public recognition that allows him to raise his profile and gain access to deals. He is not motivated by material possessions. He still lives in the Omaha house he bought for $31,500 in 1956, eats simple meals at his favorite restaurant Gorat’s, and drives a 2014 Cadillac XTS that he bought after he sold his 2006 Cadillac DTS in a charity auction. Intrinsically, Buffett is motivated by learning and sharing his knowledge, as evidenced by his candid and educational Berkshire Hathaway letters to shareholders.</p><p>As a result of Buffett’s philosophy, Berkshire Hathaway’s returns have more than doubled the S&amp;P 500 Index for the past 40 years. To put that success in context, Buffett has created twice the shareholder value of Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley combined with 24 people in a 5,000 square foot office in Omaha.</p><p>Buffett asks his partners, “Do you love the business, or do you love the money?” He only wants those who love the business.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>From <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-george/are-companies-succumbing_b_8177976.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Huffington Post</a>, posted September 22, 2015.</p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-george/are-companies-succumbing_b_8177976.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Huffington Post</a><p>Are companies and their boards succumbing to short-term pressures from shareholders?</p><p>That’s the concern of Larry Fink, CEO of Blackrock, the world’s largest fund manager with $4 trillion in assets under management. Fink personally wrote to all CEOs in the S&amp;P 500 index last spring to warn them about trying to return money to investors through so-called “shareholder-friendly” steps like increasing dividends and buying back stock. Fink believes pressure from activist investors is harming long-term shareholder value, despite stock price increases that often follow.</p><p>The pressures today have never been greater on chief executives and boards to produce short-term results and maximize shareholder value. The paradox of these pressures is that they may actually destroy long-term shareholder value if they force executives to cut R&amp;D, capital spending, new ventures and expansion in emerging markets, thus constraining future growth potential.</p><p>What is missing in the faux debate about “shareholders versus stakeholders” is a deeper understanding of how shareholder value is created. It is not just by cutting costs, as steadily declining revenues spell doom as they did for Sears and Kodak. Rather sustainable shareholder value – which I believe should be the goal of every company – comes from serving society through great products and services that in turn meet customer needs and create profitability, cash flow for ongoing investments and shareholder value. As Infosys Founder Narayana Murthy argued, “You cannot sustain long-term shareholder value without creating sustainable value for your customers.”</p><p>The responsibility of corporate leaders is to achieve their short-term objectives while investing for future growth. It is not an either-or trade off. But those who make their quarterly numbers by cutting future investments or financial engineering are headed for trouble. Investors can always sell their stock before the long-term consequences are apparent, but corporate leaders are responsible for ensuring their firm’s viability for the long-term.</p><p>Look at what happened to General Motors under former CEO Rick Waggoner and his predecessors, who consistently opted for short-term profits over product improvements and quality. Over forty years GM’s U.S. market share eroded from 52% to 18%, and the firm wound up in bankruptcy when the global recession hit in late 2008. Contrast that with Ford’s Alan Mulally who borrowed $23.5 billion in 2006 to invest in retooling Ford’s entire product line and had sufficient reserves to withstand the 2008-09 market downturn — consequently, Ford continues to thrive.</p><p>In recent years short-term traders and hedge funds have steadily gained power. These active investors, earning high fees and taking 20% of gains, have had a powerful impact on capitalism. For the past five years, however, they have struggled to justify their high fees because they have been unable to consistently outperform index funds, so increasingly they focus on driving short-term gains rather than investing for long-term returns.</p><p>These trends are raising questions about the ultimate purpose of business: is it solely to meet shareholder’s near-term expectations or do companies have larger obligations to serve society and all their stakeholders, including shareholders?</p><p>Public companies get significant privileges as limited liability corporations because they are chartered to serve society. If they do not honor their obligations to individual countries, they may be forced to depart, or have their freedom constrained by laws like Dodd-Frank imposed on financial institutions. Unfortunately, current pressures in the financial system may be forcing companies to view themselves as extractors instead of beneficiaries of society.</p><p>As my HBS colleague Michael Porter argued in his 2011 HBR article, “Creating Shared Value,” when businesses focus on both societal benefit and economic profit, they do the most good through the business model itself. General Electric’s Eco-Imagination line, for example, develops energy efficient products like traditional light bulbs that are growing rapidly and have positive externalities in saving energy.</p><p>Instead of including society as one of its many stakeholders, World Economic Forum President Klaus Schwab argues that companies should view themselves as stakeholders in society. When the world we live in improves — education expands, violence decreases, or global warming slows – everyone wins, especially shareholders. Walmart, for example, cut greenhouse gas emissions in 2009 by reducing packaging and decreasing truck routes by 100 million miles, and it saved $200 million.</p><p>As Porter observed, “The new thinking reveals that congruence between societal progress and productivity in the value chain is far greater than traditionally believed. Few companies have reaped the full productivity benefits in areas such as health, safety, environmental performance.”</p><p>A pioneer in the sustainability movement, Unilever CEO Paul Polman summed up this new mission of business, “It’s not enough anymore to say you contribute to a better world. Instead of thinking how you can use society to be successful, you have to start thinking how you can contribute to society and the environment to be successful.” Polman concluded by saying, “Unilever’s purpose is having a sustainable business model that is put at the service of the greater good. It is as simple as that.”</p><p>What if all companies reframed their purpose along these lines? Think of the impact that global companies and local enterprises could have on addressing the world’s most pressing problems.</p><div></div>"

Or are you a servant-leader who empowers others?</p><p>All of us start out in this world as individual contributors. In our early years we are measured by our grades, test scores, and solo accomplishments. As we enter the world of work, many of us envision ourselves in the hero’s image who can change the world. This is a perfectly natural embarkation point for leaders. Today’s leaders like Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google’s Larry Page have their own change-the-world narrative, yet as they matured, both have become outstanding leaders of others.</p><p>As we take on leadership responsibilities, our orientation must change. As GE’s Jamie Irick said in <em>Discover Your True North</em>, “If you want to be a leader, you’ve got to flip the switch and understand it’s about serving the folks on your team. This is a very simple concept, but one many people overlook. The sooner people realize it, the faster they become leaders.”</p><em>Discover Your True North</em><p>Irick captured the essence of servant-leadership. Robert Greenleaf, father of servant leadership, described servant leaders in 1970:</p><p><em>A servant-leader focuses primarily on the growth and well-being of people and the communities to which they belong. The servant-leader shares power, puts the needs of others first, and helps people develop and perform.</em></p><em>A servant-leader focuses primarily on the growth and well-being of people and the communities to which they belong. The servant-leader shares power, puts the needs of others first, and helps people develop and perform.</em><p>We call this journey the “I to We” transformation, because it requires that you shift your focus from your success to the success of others. In our classes for MBAs and executives at Harvard Business School, we realize this transformation is the most important one leaders experience.</p><p>Some leaders never get there, as they envision amassing legions of followers whose roles are to support them. If you fall into that trap, you will never engender great loyalty or commitment from your teammates, nor will you become an authentic leader.</p><p>Nonetheless, some fear that focusing on others may sidetrack them from reaching their personal goals. However, the opposite is true: As a leader, you can only achieve great things by being a servant leader.</p><p>Research has demonstrated conclusively that “other-focused” leaders&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/wharton-professor-adam-grant-on-success-and-generosity-2014-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lead more effective teams</a>. As Wharton psychologist Adam Grant explains, “They do so by bringing out the best in others.” As a result, givers&nbsp;<a href=\"http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/givers-vs-takers-the-surprising-truth-about-who-gets-ahead/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rise to the top</a>&nbsp;of their profession.</p><a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/wharton-professor-adam-grant-on-success-and-generosity-2014-4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">lead more effective teams</a><a href=\"http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article/givers-vs-takers-the-surprising-truth-about-who-gets-ahead/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">rise to the top</a><p>When leaders stop focusing on their needs, they are more effective in developing other leaders. By overcoming their need to control everything, they learn people are more interested in working with them. A light bulb turns on as they recognize the unlimited potential of empowered leaders working together toward a shared purpose.</p><p>At the core of these two approaches is the leader’s belief: “I” leaders believe they have the answers, and the best results will be achieved if others follow their direction. “We” leaders, on the other hand, believe that superior results result from teams of people exploring possibilities, debating options, and agreeing upon a course of action. Underlying their approach is the belief that “people support what they help create.”</p><p>It took me a long time to learn this. In my early leadership roles, I had a clear vision of what needed to be done. I spelled it out clearly to my team and invited them to challenge it, spending most of my time selling others on my ideas. When you’re the boss, you can be quite “persuasive”! As one confidant said to me, “Bill, you’re not getting the best out of your team because you’re so forceful that you shut out their ideas.” Advice well taken. After that, I tried my best to draw out others before asserting my opinions.</p><p>Making the transformation from I to We requires introspection and cognitive reframing of how you see your role as a leader, and how much you respect others’ ideas and their willing commitment. For some leaders this requires a mid-career crucible.</p><p>Steve Jobs faced such a time when he was fired by the Apple board. During his early years, Jobs was the classic “I” leader. Wildly charismatic and visionary, he bullied, cajoled, inspired, and ultimately exhausted everyone around him. The board determined the company simply couldn’t handle his domineering, though brilliant approach. He went on a journey to rethink his life and leadership. As he said,</p><p><em>I didn’t see it then, but getting fired from Apple was the best thing that ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.</em></p><em>I didn’t see it then, but getting fired from Apple was the best thing that ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life.</em><p>As part of his journey, he purchased an animated movie company, which he renamed Pixar. There, he teamed up with two great innovation leaders, Ed Catmull and John Lassiter. From this experience, Jobs grew from a great innovator to a great innovation leader. That paved the way for him to return to Apple as much more of a “We” leader who knew how to use the talents of his teammates.</p><p>Where are you in your journey? Have you become a “We” leader? Or do you shift back into an “I” mode under pressure? How has this affected the results your team accomplishes?</p><p>As you make this transformation, you are growing into a “leader of leaders” who has unlimited potential to lead others to achieve great things. In so doing, you become a servant-leader. Isn’t this what leadership is all about?</p><p><em>The ideas in this article are drawn from Chapter 9 of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discover Your True North</a>.</em></p><em>The ideas in this article are drawn from Chapter 9 of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discover Your True North</a>.</em><a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Discover Your True North</a><div></div>"

Toshiba’s problems extend back for seven years, and have cost CEO Hisao Tanaka and two key executives their jobs. They have acknowledged awareness of the improper accounting, which they attribute to short-term profit pressures.</p><p>These adjustments are not just accounting errors, they may be indications of potential fraud. If Toshiba was an American company operating under Sarbanes-Oxley, its CEO and CFO could be subject to criminal penalties.</p><p>That was followed by United Airlines announcing the resignation of its chief executive, Jeff Smisek, for his involvement in the corruption scandal with David Samson, former chair of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, involving special flights from Newark to Columbia, SC, where Samson has a home. In addition to Smisek’s resignation, two other top United executives involved in the scandal have also departed.</p><p>The former CEO of Continental Airlines, Smisek led the merger of United and Continental in 2010. As CEO for the past five years, he has been confronted by a host of operating problems from delays, computer problems and breakdowns in the reservation system plus difficulties with merging the unionized workers of the two airlines. This has led to enormous pressure on Smisek from United’s shareholders.</p><p>What is even more shocking about Smisek’s departure is that the United board has granted him a $4.9 million termination settlement plus 60,000 shares of stock worth more than $3 million. He was also awarded lifetime flying and parking privileges, this year’s bonus and his company car. This calls into the question whether the board exercised its responsibility to set a high bar on ethics for the company.</p><p>Scandals like these have no place in today’s world. They tarnish all corporations in the eyes of the general public. In both cases the CEOs were well aware of the rules and yet engaged in inappropriate and potentially illegal activities. For what reason? It appears they were responding to pressure from investors to improve short-term performance. That’s no justification for engaging in corruption, nor should we blame investors for demanding better results. And both scandals involved their subordinates as well. Will it turn out that the corruption at the top levels of United and Toshiba goes much deeper?</p><p>The CEO’s role is to develop sustainable strategies that enable their companies to perform in the near term while investing for long-term growth. In sharp contrast to Smisek’s leadership,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/DAL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Delta</a>&nbsp;CEO Richard Anderson has done just that since the company emerged from bankruptcy and acquired Northwest Airlines in 2008. Delta’s employees are engaged and focused on their customers, its computer systems work well, and the majority of its flights arrive early. This has led to very strong bottom-line results.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/DAL\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Delta</a><p>These days the public and investors are entitled to demand that companies have integrity in their accounting and their dealings, and operate with openness and transparency. Neither Toshiba nor United did so. As a consequence, their reputations are deeply scarred.</p><p>Asking board members who presided over these debacles to take over as CEO is not right either, other than on an interim basis. Rather, the boards of Toshiba and United Airlines need to bring in high integrity leaders who can restore the confidence of their customers, employees and shareholders. Failing that, expect both of these giants to continue to decline.</p><p>The only good that can emanate from these situations will be if other companies’ boards and CEOs learn from them. Capitalism only works when its leaders put first their moral responsibilities to the company and society.</p>"

After building the Huffington Post as the leading online global newspaper,&nbsp;<em>Time</em>&nbsp;chose her as one of the world’s 100 Most Influential People.</p><em>Time</em><p>Then she had a wake-up call. One day she found herself lying on the floor of her home office in a pool of blood. She had collapsed from exhaustion.</p><p>The gravity of her collapse forced Huffington to confront her lifestyle. As she explained, “I was working 18 hours a day, seven days a week. By traditional measures of money and power, I was highly successful, but by any sane definition I was not living a successful life. Something had to change radically.”</p><p>For Huffington, this moment of crisis pushed her to reflect on her life. As her self-awareness deepened, she made important life changes: focusing on her personal health, meditating daily and committing to time for herself.</p><p>The charge, “Know thyself,” is centuries old, but for today’s leaders, it has never been more important.

Developing self-awareness is the first step to develop your EQ.</p><em>&nbsp;Emotional Intelligence</em><a href=\"http://www.eiconsortium.org/reports/what_is_emotional_intelligence.html\" target=\"_blank\">more important predictor of successful leaders</a><p>My grandfather — an old Dutchman who came to America in 1876 — had a worn wooden plaque that read, “We grow too soon old, and too late wise.” As a young man, I rejected this notion as I lacked the self-awareness to understand my limitations, blind spots, and inexperience. Over the years, its truth has come back to me many times.</p><p>When True North was published in 2007, we understood the importance of self-awareness, but were not clear about how to improve our awareness. As demonstrated in my follow-on book,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Discover Your True North</em></a>, we have learned a great deal since then about how to gain self-awareness.</p><a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Discover Your True North</em></a><em>Discover Your True North</em><p>Crises like Huffington’s can force you to reassess your life to gain self-awareness and discover your True North. But you can avoid these crises by developing self-awareness now. After in-depth interviews with 170 world leaders and classroom discussions with 6,000 executives and MBAs in Authentic Leadership Development (ALD) at Harvard Business School, we’ve learned three essential steps to building your self-awareness:</p><ol>\n<li>Probing deeply into your life story and framing your crucible</li>\n<li>Creating a daily practice of introspection and reflection</li>\n<li>Receiving intimate feedback from people you trust</li>\n</ol><li>Probing deeply into your life story and framing your crucible</li><li>Creating a daily practice of introspection and reflection</li><li>Receiving intimate feedback from people you trust</li><p><strong>Understanding your life story and framing your crucible</strong></p><strong>Understanding your life story and framing your crucible</strong><p>Your journey to self-awareness begins with understanding your life story and framing your crucibles. All of us face times of crisis, pain, disappointment, or rejection during our lives. Many respond by developing false selves and building protective layers to protect themselves from pain or facing their reality. In doing so, they grow farther from their true selves and building on their life stories.</p><p>Reflecting on the life you’ve lived helps you to discover your True North – the beliefs, values and principles that are most important to you. Discover Your True North asks readers to consider these questions:</p><ul>\n<li>Looking at your early life story, what people, events, and experiences have had the greatest impact in shaping the person you have become?</li>\n<li>In which experiences did you find the greatest passion for leading?</li>\n<li>How do you frame your crucibles and setbacks in your life?</li>\n</ul><li>Looking at your early life story, what people, events, and experiences have had the greatest impact in shaping the person you have become?</li><li>In which experiences did you find the greatest passion for leading?</li><li>How do you frame your crucibles and setbacks in your life?</li><p>These questions are starting points to become aware. As you understand your life story, the reasons for your current actions become clear. Digging into your crucible is especially important: do you see yourself as a victim? do you repress the experience? Or can you reframe hardship to help find your deeper values?&nbsp;<br><strong><br>Create a daily habit of self-reflection</strong><br>Next, you should develop a daily practice of setting aside at least twenty minutes to reflect on your life. This practice enables you to focus on the important things in your life, not just the immediate. Reflection takes many forms. Some keep a journal, some pray, and others take a long walk or jog. Personally, I use daily meditation as my mindful habit. By centering into myself, I am able to focus my attention on what’s really important, and develop an inner sense of well-being.</p><br><strong><br>Create a daily habit of self-reflection</strong><br><br><p><strong>Seek Honest Feedback</strong><br>Nearly all of us have traits, habits, and tendencies that others see in us, but we are unable to see in ourselves. We call these “blind spots.” Do you see yourself as others see you? If not, your blind spots can be addressed by receiving honest feedback from people you trust.</p><strong>Seek Honest Feedback</strong><br><p>To obtain honest feedback, you must surround yourself with truth tellers. Then you must continuously others for feedback. As you do, you’ll become more self-aware.</p><p>Although a traumatic event can cause you to become self-aware, my advice is don’t wait until that happens — start developing your self-awareness now. As you follow these three practices, you will find you are more comfortable being open, transparent, and even vulnerable. As you do, you will become a more authentic leader.</p>"

      "<p>From&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-george/coping-with-crucibles_b_8071678.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Huffington Post</a>, posted September 1, 2015</p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-george/coping-with-crucibles_b_8071678.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Huffington Post</a><p><em>“Suffering is universal: You turn it around so that it becomes a creative, positive force,” (Terry Waite).</em></p><em>“Suffering is universal: You turn it around so that it becomes a creative, positive force,” (Terry Waite).</em><p>Psychologist Abraham Maslow found that tragedy and trauma are the most important human learning experiences. Crucibles enable people to learn life is uncertain, and that they have limited control over events.</p><p>In recent years, a new reality is emerging that empowers individuals to look at their crucibles and difficult experiences as growth opportunities — we term this approach, Post-Traumatic Growth.</p><p>Think of the most challenging moment in your life. Perhaps it was a time when a loved one passed away, or you had a personal health crisis. Or your lost your job or your family. Whatever it was, it was a time of crisis for you — but also a moment that caused you to reflect deeply about who you are and what is truly important in your life.</p><p>Traumatic moments propel many people into a downward spiral. As they refuse to address or even acknowledge their crucibles, they make the memories more painful. As a result of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, we are painfully aware of “Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder” — or PTSD — but this phenomenon doesn’t just happen to war victims or military veterans.</p><p>New research shows that traumatic experiences can result in post-traumatic growth (PTG). PTG starts by recognizing life’s uncertainties and embracing them as fundamental tenets of human existence. It also requires self-awareness to acknowledge your personal responsibility for the choices you make in life coupled with the desire to undergo personal transformation. As Warren Bennis explained in<em>Geeks and Geezers</em>, “Some magic takes place in the crucible of leadership. Whatever is thrown at them, leaders emerge from their crucibles stronger and unbroken.”</p><em>Geeks and Geezers</em><p>All of us face trials in our lives. How can you respond to your crucible to transform your deep feelings of loss — which are real and natural — into opportunities for personal growth?</p><p>After reading&nbsp;<em>True North</em>, Pedro Algorta, one of the survivors of the famous 1972 crash in the Andes mountains, reached out to me. In his letter, he wrote while flying with 45 friends, his plane crashed into the Andes. “After 72 days barely surviving in the mountains without food or clothing, sixteen of us were finally rescued.”</p><em>True North</em><p>For 35 years, Algorta never mentioned being part of this experience to anyone other than his wife, in spite of the worldwide publicity the event received. As an MBA student at Stanford, he didn’t even share it with his classmates. After reading&nbsp;<em>True North,</em>&nbsp;he began to process how this event had shaped his life. When he visited my Harvard Business School classes in 2008 and 2013, he shared three ways to deal with crucibles:&nbsp;</p><em>True North,</em><ul>\n<li>Focus on the event, and live your life looking backward, often an angry life of blaming others.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Live your life as if nothing happened, while the memories and the pain remain deep inside you.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Use the event to transform your wound into a pearl.</li>\n</ul><li>Focus on the event, and live your life looking backward, often an angry life of blaming others.&nbsp;</li><li>Live your life as if nothing happened, while the memories and the pain remain deep inside you.&nbsp;</li><li>Use the event to transform your wound into a pearl.</li><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my new book,&nbsp;<em>Discover Your True North</em>, Algorta shared the metaphor of the oyster pearl. When sand grates against the oyster, its natural reaction is to cover up the irritant to protect itself with a substance called nacre (mother-of-pearl), which eventually forms the pearl itself.</p><em>Discover Your True North</em><p>Are you turning your wounds into pearls?</p><p>To do so, you will need to reflect on the impact your crucible has had on your life and what you learned from the experience. After discerning its meaning, you can reframe it as an opportunity for personal growth.</p><p>My crucible came when I least expected it. In my mid-20s, I was engaged to be married, just 18 months after my mother’s sudden death. A few weeks before the wedding, my fiancée started having severe headaches. I took her to a leading neurosurgeon, but all her exams were negative. On a Saturday night three weeks before the wedding, we talked about final plans. The following morning her parents called to say she died during the night from a malignant brain tumor.</p><p>In the aftermath of her death, I could have easily become bitter and depressed and even lost my faith. In times of personal crisis, the power of faith and the support of close friends can provide the basis for healing. I was blessed to have both. Together, they enabled me to accept this tragedy and to learn just how precious every day is and to appreciate fully the value of those who are there for us when things go wrong in our lives.</p><p>Tragic as the event was, it opened my heart to the deeper meaning of life. This tragedy caused me to think more profoundly about what I could contribute to others during my lifetime. As my wife Penny explained about her breast cancer diagnosis in 1996, “Life is what happens when you’re expecting something else.”</p><p>With all of life’s uncertainties, we learn to accept what life brings us and to use each experience as an opportunity for personal growth. You cannot go through life without getting knocked down. The question is how you will respond, and whether you will come back stronger than ever. Rather than living an angry life, suppressing your crucibles, or living a fearful life, I urge you to embrace life’s uncertainties and reframe them as learning opportunities in order to turn them into pearls of wisdom.</p><p>If you do, you will lead a fuller, richer life, and you can help others to cope with life’s challenges.</p>"

Unfortunately, many&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/workforce-management/employee-performance-management/employee-engagement-tips.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leaders</a>&nbsp;of major companies believe their job is to create the strategy, organizational structure, and organizational processes. Then they delegate the work to be done, remaining aloof from the people doing the work.</p><a href=\"http://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/workforce-management/employee-performance-management/employee-engagement-tips.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">leaders</a><p>The detached&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/workforce-management/hr-management-skills/leadership-style.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">style of leadership</a>&nbsp;will not be successful in the twenty-first century. Today’s employees demand more personal relationships with their leaders before they will give themselves fully to their jobs. They insist on having access to their leaders, knowing that it is in the openness and the depth of the relationship with the leader that trust and commitment are built.</p><a href=\"http://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/workforce-management/hr-management-skills/leadership-style.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">style of leadership</a><p>Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, and Jack Welch were so successful because they connected directly with their employees and realized from them a deeper commitment to their work and greater&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/workforce-management/employee-performance-management/why-loyalty-matters.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">loyalty to the company</a>. Welch, in particular, was an interesting case because he was so challenging and hard on people. Yet those very challenges let people know that he was interested in their success and concerned about their careers.</p><a href=\"http://hiring.monster.com/hr/hr-best-practices/workforce-management/employee-performance-management/why-loyalty-matters.aspx\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">loyalty to the company</a><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Eyewitness-To-Power-Essence-Leadership/dp/0743203224\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Eyewitness to Power</em></a>, David Gergen writes, “At the heart of leadership is the leader’s relationship with followers. People will entrust their hopes and dreams to another person only if they think the other is a reliable vessel.” Authentic leaders establish trusting relationships with people throughout their organizations. The rewards of these relationships, both tangible and intangible, are long lasting.</p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Eyewitness-To-Power-Essence-Leadership/dp/0743203224\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Eyewitness to Power</em></a><em>Eyewitness to Power</em><p>Rule #1: Just Show Up<br>\nWoody Allen once remarked, “Eighty percent of success is showing up.” Surprisingly, many leaders get so busy that they don’t take the time to be there for people. They don’t bother to attend award ceremonies, company picnics, or sales meetings. Nor do they walk around the offices, factories, labs, and field sales and service locations. Often they are too busy to come to important customer meetings or trade shows.</p><br><p>As a result, their teammates never get to know them personally. Their only contact with their leaders is through impersonal media, such as speeches, voice mail, videotapes, and Web streaming of company events.</p><p>Target CEO Brian&nbsp;Cornell makes frequent visits to stores around the country, often going alone and unannounced, shaking hands and getting to know people, as well as using his astute powers of observation to see how effective Target team members are in connecting with their guests.&nbsp;These visits have given him a clear understanding of his new organization and what needs to be improved. It also led to what he termed “the most difficult decision of my career” — to close his predecessor’s ill-fated foray into Canada.</p><p>Not only did Cornell have multiple business analyses prepared to search for a way forward, but he also visited nearly empty stores the week before Christmas and realized that Target’s efforts should focus entirely on the lucrative U.S. market.</p><p>Likewise, Howard Schultz told of visiting a Starbucks store one Saturday morning:</p><p><em>I walked in, dressed so nobody&nbsp;would recognize me. When I sat down, the manager came up and said, “Howard, is that you?” I said, “Yes, it is.” She told me about receiving Starbucks stock and what it did for her and her family. Then she started crying and said, “I’m so moved that you’re in my store.” Later I got&nbsp;a voice mail from her, saying how powerful that moment was for her. I immediately called her back and thanked her for sharing with me.</em></p><em>I walked in, dressed so nobody&nbsp;would recognize me.

I immediately called her back and thanked her for sharing with me.</em><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stories of basic human interactions like this one are very powerful. All Cornell and Schultz had to do was show up. Being at important events or engaging on the front lines at unexpected times means a great deal to people and enables them to take their leaders off their proverbial pedestals and see them as real people.</p><p>Mutual Respect: The Basis for Empowerment<br>\nTo bring out the best from teammates, authentic leaders must develop trusting relationships based on mutual respect. There is no substitute. Like loyalty, respect provides a basis for empowerment, but leaders must earn it. Here are some of the things empowering leaders do to gain the respect of their colleagues:</p><br><ul>\n<li>Treat others as equals</li>\n<li>Listen actively</li>\n<li>Learn from people</li>\n<li>Share life stories</li>\n<li>Align around the mission</li>\n</ul><li>Treat others as equals</li><li>Listen actively</li><li>Learn from people</li><li>Share life stories</li><li>Align around the mission</li><p><strong>Treat Others as Equals</strong><br>\nWe respect people who treat us as equals, especially when they are successful investors, such as Warren Buffett. He has the same sandwich and Cherry Coke combination with a group of wide-eyed students as he does with his close friend Bill Gates.</p><strong>Treat Others as Equals</strong><br><p>Buffett does not rely upon his image to make people feel he is important or powerful. He genuinely respects others, and they respect him as much for those qualities as for his investment prowess. By being authentic in his interactions, Buffett empowers people to lead in their own authentic way.</p><p><strong>Listen Actively</strong><br>\nWe are grateful when people genuinely listen to us. Active listening is one of the most important abilities of empowering leaders, because people sense such individuals are genuinely interested in them and not just trying to get something from them.</p><strong>Listen Actively</strong><br><p>Warren Bennis was an example of a world-class listener. He patiently listened as you explained your ideas and then thoughtfully contributed astute observations that came from a deep well of wisdom and experience.</p><p><strong>Learn from People</strong><br>\nWe feel respected when others believe they can learn from us or ask for our advice. The best advice I ever got about teaching came from my Harvard Business School (HBS) colleague Paul Marshall, who was one of HBS’s greatest teachers. He told me, “Bill, don’t ever set foot in an HBS classroom unless you genuinely want to learn from the students.”</p><strong>Learn from People</strong><br><p>I have taken his advice into every class I have taught for the past 12 years, telling MBA students and executives, “I feel certain I will learn a lot more from you than you do from me.” The students find that hard to believe at first, but they soon see how their feedback helps me understand how today’s leaders and MBA students think.</p>"

Cut adrift on a raging sea?</p><p>I know I have. When I was reaching the top of Honeywell, I was working 24/7. Having succeeded in turning around a series of troubled businesses, I was tasked with even more turnarounds. On the outside I appeared energized and confident. On the inside I was deeply unhappy but too driven to admit it. In truth, I was losing sight of my True North – more interested in becoming CEO than being a values-centered leader. Driving home one day I had “a flash in the mirror” and saw the real me. It wasn’t pretty.</p><p>That day, I felt like Dante who began the Divine Comedy, “In the middle of the road of my life, I awoke in a dark wood where the true way was wholly lost.” Thanks to that mirror, and the help of my wife and support team, I woke up and decided to rethink my life and career. This self-examination led me to Medtronic and the best 13 years of my professional life.</p><p>My personal experience suggests you can get back on track of your True North IF you recognize the signals before it’s too late.</p><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Discover Your True North</em></a>, I describe&nbsp;<a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/what-pulls-you-away-from-your-true-north/\" target=\"_blank\">five behaviors that can cause you to lose your way</a>:&nbsp;<strong>Imposters, Rationalizers, Glory Seekers, Loners, and Shooting Stars</strong>. Let’s examine each of them:</p><a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Discover Your True North</em></a><em>Discover Your True North</em><a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/what-pulls-you-away-from-your-true-north/\" target=\"_blank\">five behaviors that can cause you to lose your way</a><strong>Imposters, Rationalizers, Glory Seekers, Loners, and Shooting Stars</strong><p><strong>Imposters</strong></p><strong>Imposters</strong><p>Imposters try to reach the top by pretending to be leaders. They are good at office politics — too good. Aggression and paranoia become their hallmarks, and they’ll attempt to eliminate anyone blocking their path. Outwardly, they follow the adage, “You have to fake it to make it.” Inside, they are driven by the fear they aren’t good enough and someone will unmask them as imposters. They rarely ask for help or admit, “I don’t know.”</p><p>Bob Nardelli had a highly successful career at General Electric, becoming one of three candidates to succeed the legendary Jack Welch. Disappointed he wasn’t chosen as CEO, he moved to retailer Home Depot, lured by an enormous compensation package. Failing to spend time listening to store managers and customers, he never grasped the retail business. Instead, he centralized decision-making and reduced in-store support for customers. He terminated 70 of 71 vice presidents, replacing them with many ex-military officers willing to follow headquarters orders. As Home Depot steadily lost retail market share, its board replaced Nardelli with veteran Frank Blake, who restored the company and put it on a sustainable growth path.</p><p><strong>Rationalizers</strong></p><strong>Rationalizers</strong><p>Rationalizers are skillful in blaming others or external factors for their problems. Often they aren’t willing to face reality, admit their mistakes, or see that their distorted view of the world puts their organizations in jeopardy.</p><p>As CEO of General Motors, Rick Waggoner never could face the reality that his company’s drastic decline in market share – from 50% to 18% of the U.S. market – resulted from making cars and trucks that didn’t measure up to GM’s competitors. Instead, he blamed high gasoline prices, government regulations, and GM’s unions. Unwilling to look himself in the mirror, he eventually led GM into bankruptcy.</p><p><strong>Glory Seekers</strong></p><strong>Glory Seekers</strong><p>Glory Seekers are so hungry for fame and public adulation that they deviate from their values just to get ahead.</p><p>Lance Armstrong created a great narrative for his success: seven-time winner of the Tour de France, cancer survivor, and philanthropist with his Livestrong campaign. An extraordinary cyclist, he elected instead to cheat, using illegal performance-enhancing drugs to win races. Ultimately, Armstrong lost all his Tour de France titles when he was found guilty of doping.</p><p><strong>Loners</strong></p><strong>Loners</strong><p>All leaders experience loneliness in their careers, often when they reach their peak. People in high-pressure positions often retreat to their offices rather than listening to subordinates and trusted confidents. That’s when they are prone to make big mistakes.</p><p>As CEO of Lehman Brothers, Richard Fuld refused to listen to his team members or outside confidants. Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson warned him forty times that Lehman was deeply overleveraged and need to raise capital. When Paulson asked the major banks to develop plans to salvage Lehman, Fuld stayed in his office, in denial about his firm’s troubles. When Lehman declared bankruptcy three days later, employees lost their jobs, customers lost their holdings, and shareholders lost their investments. As a result, the financial markets plunged into crisis and the entire country had to pay for Fuld’s solipsism.</p><p><strong>Shooting Stars</strong></p><strong>Shooting Stars</strong><p>Shooting stars are so focused in climbing the career ladder that they have no time for their families and friends. They crave success and get lost in unsustainable frenzy of work. They leap from job to job without learning from their mistakes or gaining self-awareness. Ultimately, they cannot sustain the pace, as even the most energetic people run out of steam. When they crash, they come down fast.</p><p>Silicon Valley shooting star Mark Pincus initially soared with gaming company Zynga. But the company’s faddish products were unsustainable. As he reflected later, “I did every horrible thing in the book, just to get immediate revenues.” Because its leaders failed to create sustainable business models, Zygna’s star came crashing down.</p><p>If you are aware of your vulnerabilities and stay laser-focused on your True North, you won’t fall into these traps. If you develop self-awareness, build your support team, and follow your values, you can stay on track and avoid these pitfalls.</p>"

The ever-increasing pressures to deliver short-term results while continuing to make big bets on high-risk, high-gain ventures is a conundrum, even for high-flying Google with its dual classes of stock.</p><p>With nearly $70 billion in annual revenue, a market capitalization of more than $450 billion, and a stock trading at 31 times its price/earnings ratio, it will take very large bets on major breakthroughs to sustain Google’s growth. Those bets don’t turn into winners without enormous investment and the willingness to take big risks. Meanwhile, Google’s investors are clamoring for greater transparency, which can lead to pressure to cut back on uncertain investments or create premature visibility. Google’s leaders have the wisdom to know that size and creativity are inversely correlated, as witnessed so vividly in the demise of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/HPQ\" target=\"_blank\">Hewlett-Packard</a>‘s innovation machine. Thus, they are breaking the company into a collection of innovative organizations — some very large, some small — that provides their leaders the freedom to innovate without near-term financial constraints.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/HPQ\" target=\"_blank\">Hewlett-Packard</a><p>Some pundits claim that greater visibility will stifle Google’s innovations, which they term “unprofitable experiments.” In reality, all research projects are “losers” until they succeed in the marketplace. These critics don’t seem to understand the determination of Larry Page and his cohort of brilliant leaders to transform the world through innovation.</p><p>Nevertheless, I won’t be surprised to see an activist investor like Dan Loeb or Nelson Peltz call for breaking up Alphabet in a few years into cash-generating Google and growth-generating Alphabet. Their inability to understand the integration of these two differentiated strategies for long-term shareholder value creation — the strategy we followed at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/MDT\" target=\"_blank\">Medtronic</a>&nbsp;— never ceases to amaze me.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/MDT\" target=\"_blank\">Medtronic</a><p>Other writers are comparing Alphabet to Warren Buffett’s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/BRK.A\" target=\"_blank\">Berkshire-Hathaway</a>. Other than both organizations being led by brilliant people, this comparison doesn’t hold water. Buffett’s genius is buying up traditional low-tech companies and running them well. He openly eschews innovation. Google is all about innovation.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/BRK.A\" target=\"_blank\">Berkshire-Hathaway</a><p>Peter Sims, who co-authored “True North” with me, had a far better comparison: Today’s high-tech leaders like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/AAPL\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/FB\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/AMZN\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, and Uber are platforms on which to build profitable business extensions off a solid core structure.

      "<p>From&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-george/for-leadership-do-you-nee_b_7997680.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Huffington Post</a>, posted August 17, 2015</p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-george/for-leadership-do-you-nee_b_7997680.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Huffington Post</a><p>On your leadership journey, should you take a ladder or a compass?</p><p>The answer depends on whether you are trying to build a career or have a fulfilling life. As David Brooks writes in The Road to Character, “Are you pursuing resume values or eulogy values?”</p><p>When I graduated from college, I had the naive notion that my leadership journey was a straight line to the top. Keep climbing the rungs of the ladder and eventually I would reach my destination.</p><p>Was I ever wrong.</p><p>I learned the hard way that leadership isn’t about climbing rungs on the ladder of success, while building the perfect resume. Former Vanguard CEO Jack Brennan believes the worst thing people can do is to manage their careers with a career map. He told me, “The dissatisfied people I have known and those who experienced ethical or legal failures all had a clear career plan.”</p><p>The idea of a career ladder places tremendous pressure on leaders to keep climbing ever higher. Instead, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, favors the idea of a career “jungle gym” where you can move up, down or across. Adds eBay CEO John Donahoe, “Leadership is a journey, not a destination. It is a marathon, not a sprint.” On your winding journey, you need a compass to stay focused on your True North, not a ladder whose rungs you climb.</p><p>Becoming an authentic leader requires building your character. As Warren Bennis wrote, “Leadership is character, not style. It is who we are as human beings. The process of becoming a leader is much the same as becoming an integrated human being.”</p><p>In my early years, I was hardly recognized as a leader by my peers. I was eager – too eager – to get ahead. In high school and college, I lost seven consecutive elections. There was a simple reason for this. I was so ambitious and centered on myself that I never took the time to develop close relationships.</p><p>Then a group of seniors at Georgia Tech gave me some sound advice. “Bill, you seem more interested in getting ahead than in helping other people. No wonder no one wants to follow your lead.” Devastated by this feedback, I took their advice to heart and came to grips with my shortcomings, focusing on others instead of myself. As a result, I was selected to lead many organizations.</p><p>Years later, I got caught again in my own trap. In the late 1980s, I was on my way to the top of Honeywell. As executive vice president responsible for nine divisions and 18,000 people, I was one of two leading candidates to become CEO. Driving home one day, I looked in the rear view mirror and saw a miserable person – me. On the surface, I appeared to be energized and confident, but inside I was deeply unhappy. In that instant I realized I was more focused on climbing the corporate ladder than being a values-centered leader who makes a difference in the world. I faced the reality that Honeywell was changing me more than I was changing it–and didn’t like the changes I saw.</p><p>As Dante starts The Divine Comedy, “In the middle of the road of my life, I awoke in a dark wood, where the true way was wholly lost.”</p><p>When I awoke to my reality, I reopened the opportunity to join Medtronic that I had turned down three times before. This decision led to the best thirteen years of my professional life. Had I not had that awakening at Honeywell, I might never have seen Medtronic’s possibilities.</p><p>In researching my new book, Discover Your True North, we interviewed 170 authentic leaders, from Oprah Winfrey to Howard Schultz. All of them followed difficult paths to success and authenticity, yet stayed grounded by building on their life stories. By understanding their formative experiences, they reframed their stories and shaped their leadership around following their True North.</p><p>From these interviews we learned that the journey to leadership has three distinct phases, detailed below:</p><p><strong>The Journey to Authentic Leadership</strong></p><strong>The Journey to Authentic Leadership</strong><p>Phase I is “Preparing for Leadership,” where leaders develop through education, extracurricular experiences, and early professional work. This is the period where character forms and people lead for the first time. In Phase I most people are naturally self-absorbed, as measures of success are based primarily on individual accomplishments. The basis of authenticity, however, lies in the values they develop in these early years.</p><p>Phase II, “Leading,” begins as individuals take responsibility for leading others and transition from “I to We,” culminating in their peak leadership experience. As they take on greater responsibilities, most leaders have setbacks that test them to their core: their sense of self, their values, and their career assumptions. Through these crucible experiences, leaders learn who they are at their essence and prepare themselves for greater challenges ahead.</p><p>Phase III is “Generativity,” wherein leaders focus on giving back by sharing their knowledge and wisdom with many people and organizations. These days, many leaders are foregoing conventional retirement to share their leadership experiences with others, serving on boards, mentoring young leaders, or teaching and writing. Psychologist Erik Erikson describes the choice in this phase: generativity versus stagnation. For leaders who focus on helping others, this stage is filled with meaning. Those who don’t often face the stagnation common with old age.</p><p>Regardless of where you are in your journey–just getting started, looking for new challenges, or nearing the top–each leadership experience provides myriad opportunities for personal growth and to discover your True North. If you embrace your life story and learn from its lessons, your leadership journey leads to great satisfaction and fulfillment.</p><p>As former Amgen CEO Kevin Sharer said, “You are the mosaic of all your experiences.”</p>"

      "<p>Trust is the essence of leadership – the coin of the realm. Unless people build trust with their colleagues, they cannot gain legitimacy to lead, nor can they empower others.</p><p>Recent studies have shown that only half of Americans trust their leaders. Since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, many Americans have lost trust in their leaders and the institutions they lead.</p><p>Gaining the trust of people is essential for every leader. Leaders cannot be effective without full confidence of the constituencies that grant their institution its legitimacy, nor can capitalism function without trust.</p><p>No matter how effective your strategy, your vision, or your communication, you will fail to achieve the desired results for your organization if you can- not inspire trust as a leader. Lack of trust in your leadership will cause your team to fear failure, resulting in less risk-taking, and therefore, less innovation. Building a culture of trust starts with you. You must quell fears of organizational power by exhibiting authentic behavior that inspires trust and fosters an open, safe environment.</p><p>To be worthy of trust, leaders must have a clear sense of their True North – the purpose of their leadership and the essence of their beliefs, their values and the principles by which they lead. If they stay on course of their True North and do not deviate under pressure, then they can build trust among colleagues and legitimacy among all their constituencies.</p><p>What’s required are new leaders who are grounded in authenticity, relationships, and emotional intelligence. To gain trust, they must be genuine, sincere, transparent, and true to their word. People sense who is authentic and who is not. Only when they are authentic will people grant them the support they need to lead organizations.</p><p>To strengthen the trust and confidence in America’s leaders, we need a new leadership mindset and a new breed of leaders, with five characteristics in common:</p><ol>\n<li>They should be authentic leaders, focused on serving their clients and all the institution’s constituents, rather than charismatic leaders seeking money, fame, and power for themselves.</li>\n<li>They should place the interests of their institutions and society as a whole above their own interests.</li>\n<li>They should have the integrity to tell the whole truth, admit their mistakes, and acknowledge their shortcomings. Authentic leadership is not about being perfect. It is having the courage to admit when you’re wrong and to get on with solving problems, rather than covering them up.</li>\n<li>They need to adapt quickly to new realities, changing themselves as well as their institutions, rather than going into denial when things don’t go as intended.</li>\n<li>They need the resilience to bounce back after dev- astating losses. Resilience enables leaders to restore trust by empowering people to create new solu- tions that build great institutions for the future.</li>\n</ol><li>They should be authentic leaders, focused on serving their clients and all the institution’s constituents, rather than charismatic leaders seeking money, fame, and power for themselves.</li><li>They should place the interests of their institutions and society as a whole above their own interests.</li><li>They should have the integrity to tell the whole truth, admit their mistakes, and acknowledge their shortcomings.

Resilience enables leaders to restore trust by empowering people to create new solu- tions that build great institutions for the future.</li><p>Earning trust requires significant time and effort, and must come from a place of authenticity. Trust cannot be faked. You cannot become a trusted leader by try- ing to imitate someone else. You can learn from others’ experiences, but there is no way you can be successful when you are trying to be like them. People trust you when you are genuine and authentic, not a replica of someone else.</p><p>Don’t be afraid to show your vulnerability. Be transparent with your team, even when the truth may be unpopular or inconvenient. Don’t punish those who bring you bad news. Encourage risk-taking and celebrate “good failures” as opportunities to learn and move forward.</p><p><strong>Remember:&nbsp;</strong>trust starts with you but it is a win-win for everyone.</p><strong>Remember:&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Bill George&nbsp;</strong>is the former Chair and Chief Executive Officer of Medtronics and author of four best-selling books including&nbsp;<em>True North&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Seven Lessons for Leading in Crisis</em>. www.billgeorge.org</p><strong>Bill George&nbsp;</strong><em>True North&nbsp;</em><em>Seven Lessons for Leading in Crisis</em><p>This article was originally published for the Winter 2015 issue of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://files.ctctcdn.com/2f93cf0e201/1bea0cd9-4b52-4e92-a516-23b343fc314b.pdf?utm_source=2015+Top+Thought+Leaders+Announcement&amp;utm_campaign=December+Trust+Sheet&amp;utm_medium=email\">Trust Magazine</a>.</p><a href=\"https://files.ctctcdn.com/2f93cf0e201/1bea0cd9-4b52-4e92-a516-23b343fc314b.pdf?utm_source=2015+Top+Thought+Leaders+Announcement&amp;utm_campaign=December+Trust+Sheet&amp;utm_medium=email\">Trust Magazine</a>"

Do you have a path to fulfilling your dreams?</p><p>You can do so just by being yourself, and developing the gifts already inside you. Can you recall a time when you felt intensely alive? A moment when you could say with confidence, “This is the real me?” That is when you are in sync with your True North.</p><p>True North is your orienting point – your fixed point in a spinning world – that helps you stay on track as a leader. It is derived from your most deeply held beliefs, values, and the principles you lead by. It is your internal compass, unique to you, representing who you are at your deepest level.</p><p>The key to finding fulfillment in life is to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Discover-Your-True-North-George/dp/1119082943\" target=\"_blank\">Discover Your True North</a>&nbsp;– the title of my latest book, being released this week (Wiley: August 17, 2015). To become an authentic leader you have to discover your True North and stay on its course throughout your life. As you do so, you will be prepared to lead in this new era. A fulfilled life is not just about your self-interest, but serving those around you and taking on challenges to make this world a better place.</p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Discover-Your-True-North-George/dp/1119082943\" target=\"_blank\">Discover Your True North</a><p>Written as a follow-up to True North (2007), Discover Your True North focuses on all leaders – from Millennials just starting their careers to CEOs at the peak of their leadership. It is the most comprehensive guide ever written to becoming an authentic leader. We have assembled the most important learnings from the stories of 101 leaders we profiled, as well as our latest ideas on developing authentic leaders.</p><p>In preparing to write Discover Your True North, I took a closer look at today’s leaders by interviewing 47 exceptional leaders in addition to the 125 leaders in our original 2005-06 research. The new group is more diverse, more global, and more in tune with society’s issues. They include Arianna Huffington, Jack Ma, and Mike Bloomberg among others. Through teaching executives at Harvard Business School, I also have had opportunities to interact with more than 5,000 business, non-profit and government leaders.</p><p>These interviews confirmed the dramatic changes in today’s leaders:</p><ul>\n<li>Authenticity has become the gold standard for leaders.</li>\n<li>Charisma, image and style have been replaced by character, humility, and service.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/08/03/bill-george-leadership-ceos/\" target=\"_blank\">Hierarchical leaders are out</a>, empowering leaders are in.</li>\n<li>Today’s leaders celebrate diversity and understand how to lead in global environments.</li>\n<li>They are in sync with society’s most important issues and are committed to use their organizations to create positive value for all stakeholders.</li>\n</ul><li>Authenticity has become the gold standard for leaders.</li><li>Charisma, image and style have been replaced by character, humility, and service.</li><li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/08/03/bill-george-leadership-ceos/\" target=\"_blank\">Hierarchical leaders are out</a>, empowering leaders are in.</li><a href=\"http://fortune.com/2015/08/03/bill-george-leadership-ceos/\" target=\"_blank\">Hierarchical leaders are out</a><li>Today’s leaders celebrate diversity and understand how to lead in global environments.</li><li>They are in sync with society’s most important issues and are committed to use their organizations to create positive value for all stakeholders.</li><p><strong>How Leadership Has Changed</strong></p><strong>How Leadership Has Changed</strong><p>Our expectations for leaders have escalated significantly in the past decade, in part due to the 2008-09 financial crisis that damaged the public’s perception of leaders. From these experiences, today’s leaders learned what not to do, as they witnessed many of their predecessors trap themselves chasing money, fame, and power – losing sight of their True North. They learned the perils of putting self-interest ahead of the institutions they led.</p><p>Simultaneously, the Millennials have changed our expectations for leaders. This generation won’t tolerate bureaucracy or excess hierarchy, and they work in more collaborative ways. Millennials want to make meaningful contributions immediately to the world and yearn to see their leaders as real people, authentically struggling with challenges just as they do.</p><p>Finally, today’s leaders are more diverse in gender, race and national origin, and are much more focused on global leadership.</p><p><strong>The Journey to Discovering Your True North</strong></p><strong>The Journey to Discovering Your True North</strong><p>The journey to authentic leadership begins with understanding yourself. As Howard Schultz, CEO of Starbucks, told me, “The reservoir of all my life experiences shaped me as a person and a leader.” Many of us are influenced by painful crucibles: personal illness, death of a loved one, or discrimination. By reflecting deeply on these events, we can understand ourselves and the values we hold most dear.</p><p>This process of discovering who you are at your deepest level requires introspection, support, and feedback. Mindful practices, such as daily meditation, prayer, or journaling, are important first steps. From there, you can incorporate outside feedback from close friends, family, and mentors. But ultimately, you must take responsibility for your own development.</p><p>Authentic leaders are true to themselves and to their beliefs. They have discovered their True North, align people around a shared purpose, and empower them to lead authentically. Because they engender trust and develop genuine connections with people, authentic leaders are able to motivate them to achieve higher levels of performance. As servant leaders, they are more concerned about serving people than their own success or recognition.</p><p>Discovering your True North takes a lifetime of commitment and learning, but its rewards are unlimited. Some days will be better than others, but as long as you are true to who you are, you can cope with the most difficult circumstances life presents.</p><p>As you embark on your journey, or enter into your next phase, I hope you will take Discover Your True North with you. At the end of each chapter you will find valuable exercises that help you understand yourself more deeply and stay on track. To start your process now, check out&nbsp;<a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/\" target=\"_blank\">my website for the book</a>&nbsp;which contains useful self-assessment tools, in-depth features of the interviewees, video content, and articles on authentic leaders.</p><a href=\"http://discoveryourtruenorth.org/\" target=\"_blank\">my website for the book</a><p>By dedicating yourself to discovering your True North, you can fulfill your dreams and become an authentic leader who makes a positive difference in your world.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>From&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-george/the-millennials-ready-to_b_7924838.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Huffington Post</a>, posted August 3, 2015</p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-george/the-millennials-ready-to_b_7924838.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Huffington Post</a><p>Many Baby Boomers look down on Millennials as over-protected, lazy, attention-seeking young kids who haven’t faced hardship.</p><p>They are dead wrong.</p><p>By 2020, Millennials — born between 1981 and 1997 — will make up 50 percent of the workforce. As their influence grows, we’ll see a generation more focused on authenticity, mindfulness, and learning through adversity. Millennials are ready to lead now. As they do, they’ll transform our ideas of leadership for the better.</p><p>Worried about Millennial leadership? Don’t be. More than any generation, Millennials are transforming our ideas about leadership, as they use their life stories to fuel their authentic purpose — their True North. They are highly collaborative, culturally competent, and celebrate diversity of gender, race, national origin and sexual preference. 70% of Millennials support same-sex marriage compared with 45 percent of Baby Boomers.</p><p>Lazy? Hardly. They are constant learners and the most educated generation ever. In the workplace, they are deadline-driven employees who get lots done in short periods. Growing up as digital natives, they are constantly connected and eager to learn new technologies. As social media experts, they are their organization’s megaphone to the new generation.</p><p>Attention-seeking? Not quite. Millennials have a deep passion for making a difference in the world. They seek careers where they can have immediate impact with emphasis on social good. No doubt they are impatient. Born into a world with instant communication, they want to have influence on those around them. Consequently, they are unwilling to tolerate bureaucracy. That’s why so many are starting their own businesses and nonprofit organizations.</p><p>Not everything is rosy for the Millennial generation. The profligacy of the Baby Boomers is saddling them with enormous debt and unfunded Social Security and Medicare obligations, as well as mountains of student debt. While Millennials are working more hours than any prior generation, their average earnings are the lowest since 1980.</p><p>The most prominent Millennial leader, Mark Zuckerberg, displays the wisdom and maturity we can expect of this generation. Zuckerberg founded Facebook at age 19; now at 31, he is already worth $35 billion. Older entrepreneurs have waited to give away their fortunes. Zuckerburg hasn’t. He and his wife Priscilla Chan have already made enormous charitable grants, such as $2.5 billion in Facebook stock to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, $100 million to Newark public schools and $75 million to San Francisco General Hospital. Millennials look up to him: a survey of Millennials named Zuckerberg as best representative of their generation.</p><p>Zuckerberg’s leadership mirrors that of Malala Yousafzai – the 18-year-old Pakistani woman who became the youngest Nobel Prize laureate. At the age of 12, Malala began writing about life with the Taliban. Three years later, an armed gunman boarded her school bus and shot her, grazing her forehead. After months of intensive care, she set out on a global campaign to improve female access to education.</p><p>This past winter I met Taylor Carol, a Harvard College student whose life story defines his mission. Upon meeting, Taylor seems like the all-American student: ingenuous, hardworking, and surrounded by friends. Then he tells you he was diagnosed with terminal cancer at age 11.</p><p>When a baseball injury didn’t heal, Taylor to a nearby hospital for testing. There a doctor told him he had a rare form of leukemia that doesn’t respond to normal treatments and had only two weeks to live. Unwilling to accept that diagnosis, his parents took him to Seattle Children’s Hospital for experimental treatment.</p><p>The next two years of Taylor’s life were as difficult as anyone can imagine: bone marrow transplant, weeks in complete isolation, and inability to eat, walk, or speak for extended periods. Most difficult of all was watching the death of his best friend, Christian. Taylor explained, “I was broken by Christian’s death. Why did he die and I lived?”</p><p>Facing hardship isn’t new to this generation, but their response is. Millennial leaders face life with what psychologist Carol Dweck calls a growth mindset. They see crucibles as opportunities for post-traumatic growth (PTG) where they can embrace life’s uncertainties and use them for personal growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Taylor used his experience in overcoming terminal cancer to develop his abilities as a singer/songwriter. He became National Spokesperson for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society and helped raise $10 million. Having missed four years of school, he was advised to get a graduate equivalent degree (GED). Instead, he studied intensely and was accepted to Harvard College.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.taylorcarol.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Taylor</a>&nbsp;is currently working in Los Angeles — singing, songwriting, and producing his first album.</p><a href=\"http://www.taylorcarol.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Taylor</a><p>Nadir Vissanjy overcame great difficulties just to graduate from college. Born in Lisbon, Portugal, he moved with his family to Central California at age nine. When his parents divorced, Nadir lost legal status in America and became undocumented. Since his mother worked in a convenience store, college wasn’t financially possible. In his senior year of high school, California passed the Dream Act, permitting undocumented children to pay in-state college tuition. Suddenly, Nadir’s life changed.</p><p>Inspired by this opportunity, Nadir has devoted his life to giving back. At Sonoma State, he became student body president, and was elected chairman of the California State Student Association. Graduating recently from MIT’s Sloan School and Harvard Kennedy School, he is returning to Oakland “to give back to the system that has given me so much.”</p><p>By embracing all aspects of their life stories, Millennial leaders are discovering their True North and acting on it to improve the world. Maybe it’s time for the Baby Boomers to step aside and turn over leadership to this remarkable new generation of leaders like Zuckerberg, Yousafzai, Carol, and Vissanjy.</p>"

      "<p>From <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-george/the-power-of-mindful-lead_b_7878482.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Huffington Post</a>, posted July 27, 2015</p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-george/the-power-of-mindful-lead_b_7878482.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Huffington Post</a><p>From the moment you wake up, you’re bombarded with distractions. Emails clog your inbox, requests pile up, and notifications flicker in the background. Within moments your attention is scattered. Given the realities of today’s 24/7 world, how do great leaders slow down and focus in order to make thoughtful decisions?</p><p>Mindfulness.</p><p>Mindfulness is the practice of self-observation without judgment with a focus on our minds and inner voices. Mindful practices include daily meditation, prayer, journaling, or jogging alone. In a fast paced world, mindfulness enables you to clear your mind of clutter, focus on what is important, and be creative. Leaders like Arianna Huffington and Steve Jobs are well known for their mindfulness practices.</p><p>As our lives have become filled with technology, the distractions we face increase exponentially. With it, our ability to focus has diminished, but our need to think clearly in order to make complex decisions has not. More than ever, leaders need to train themselves to be fully present.</p><p>Becoming a mindful leader isn’t easy. There are no five easy steps to do so. A few years ago when I asked the Dalai Lama how we can develop a new generation of compassionate, mindful leaders, he replied simply, “Develop a daily habit of introspection.”</p><p>Today many more companies are promoting mindful practices to improve the health and decision-making of their leaders. Google, under the tutelage of Chade-Meng Tan, trains 2,000 engineers in meditation each year. When I visited Google this spring, it was evident that mindfulness is one of the key reasons behind Google’s innovative and harmonious culture. Leading financial services firms like Blackrock and Goldman Sachs offer mindfulness courses for their employees. At General Mills Janice Marturano was so successful in mindfulness training that she founded the Institute for Mindful Leadership.</p><p><strong>My Mindful Practice: Meditation</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>\nIn 1975 my wife Penny and I went to a weekend program on Transcendental Meditation. At the time I was working nonstop, coming home exhausted, and having late dinners. I even got denied for life insurance because of high blood pressure. After the training, I started meditating twice daily–not as a spiritual practice, but for health reasons. Forty years later, I still practice regularly.</p><strong>My Mindful Practice: Meditation</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><p>Meditation is the best thing I have ever done to calm myself and separate from the 24/7, connected world. By centering into myself, I can focus my attention on the important things, develop an inner sense of well-being, and gain clarity in making decisions. My most creative ideas come from meditating, and meditation has built resilience to deal with difficult times. No doubt it has helped me become a better leader.<br>\n<strong><br>\nThe Science of Mindfulness&nbsp;</strong><br>\nMind training, of which meditation is one form, can change the composition of your mind. Research by Wisconsin’s Richard Davidson demonstrated direct correlation between mindfulness and changes in the brain – away from anger and anxiety and toward a sense of calm and well-being. UCLA’s Mindful Awareness Research Center found meditation can improve executive functions (sustaining attention, diminishing distractibility) better than medication in many cases.</p><br><strong><br>\nThe Science of Mindfulness&nbsp;</strong><br><br><p>Daniel Goleman, the father of emotional intelligence, describes the effect of mindfulness for focusing the mind’s cognitive abilities. As Goleman says in his new book, Focus, “One way to boost our will power and focus is to manage our distractions instead of letting them manage us.”</p><p><strong>The Growing Importance of Mindfulness</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br>\nIncreasingly, companies see mindfulness training as a competitive advantage. Aetna, the nation’s third largest health insurer, partnered with Duke University to study meditation and yoga. Researchers found these practices decreased stress levels by 28%, improved sleep quality (20%), reduced pain (19%), and improved productivity 62 minutes per employee per week. Aetna is now offering similar programs to all employees as well as its insured customers.</p><strong>The Growing Importance of Mindfulness</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><p>The World Health Organization estimates that stress costs American businesses roughly $300 billion dollars per year. Over the past thirty years, we’ve experienced an 18-23% increase of self-reported stress for men and women, respectively. As companies such as Google, General Mills, Blackstone, and Goldman Sachs have shown, mindfulness training decreases stress levels.</p><p>The key to effective leadership is the ability to integrate your head (IQ) with your heart (EQ). As Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh taught me years ago, “The longest journey you will ever take is the eighteen inches from your head to your heart.” Our hearts are where essential leadership qualities like passion, compassion and courage reside. By practicing mindfulness, mindful leaders exhibit high levels of self-awareness and intentionality in their actions.</p><p>The best time to start a mindful practice is now, but don’t take the word “practice” lightly. Maintaining the discipline of your practice isn’t easy. To become a mindful leader, you need to make this a daily introspective act. As you do so, you’ll worry less about day-to-day problems and focus on what is most important. As you become more mindful, you will be a more effective, successful and fulfilled leader.</p><p>That’s worth twenty minutes a day, isn’t it?</p><p><em>Bill George is a senior fellow at Harvard Business School and author of Discover Your True North.

      "<p>Originally published in <a href=\"http://www.hrps.org/?page=peoplestrategy\" target=\"_blank\">People + Strategy</a> Journal: Volume 38, Issue 3, Summer 2015</p><a href=\"http://www.hrps.org/?page=peoplestrategy\" target=\"_blank\">People + Strategy</a><p>When 31-year-old Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg decided he wanted a deeper understanding of China, he made concerted efforts to learn Mandarin and then demonstrated his acumen by speaking comfortably with Chinese students. In May, Alibaba founder Jack Ma promoted 42-year-old Daniel Zhang to CEO to “hand over leadership to those born in the ’70s.” These are just two examples of the new global leaders.</p><p>As they focus on expanding their business around the world, companies are facing a dearth of experienced global executives capable of leading in all parts of the world, especially in emerging markets. We can rise to the challenge of how companies develop authentic global leaders of all ages by increasing their global intelligence (GQ). Given the enormous volatility of emerging markets, leading today’s global organizations requires different skills and personal qualities than in the past. Just a few years ago, geographic managers could ensure success by relying on their knowledge of local markets, operating skills, technical understanding, and financial acumen.</p><p>No longer.</p><p>To create dynamic global strategies and adaptive organizational structures, today’s leaders must understand the global context of their business and possess awareness of how geopolitical events can impact it. They must be skilled in aligning their multicultural organizations around the company’s mission and values, making them the unifying force coalescing their far-flung organizations. Interpersonally, they need high levels of self-awareness, cultural sensitivity, and humility to empower people throughout the world. Finally, they must be able to develop other global leaders and serve as their mentors and role models.</p><p>Beyond those challenges, today’s society is demanding that global leaders practice the highest ethical standards and contribute meaningfully to countries in which they do business. It is no longer sufficient to meet the demands of the shareholders and laws and ethics of their home markets without regard for the negative consequences that their businesses may have on the countries where they operate. As a result, global leaders are partnering with local governments to support the progress and growth of their societies.</p><p>While it is challenging to possess all these qualities, nothing less is required to sustain consistently superior performance. Firms run by a cadre of global leaders effective in operating in this new world will be more competitive, more productive, and more profitable over the long term.</p><p>The multi-national model, with its matrix structure that attempts to balance strategic business units with geographic organizations, has become the dominant organization form, but today its effectiveness requires different kinds of leaders. In the past, multi-national organizations like British bank HSBC sent talented expatriates from their home countries to lead regional and local units and transfer headquarters standards, processes, control systems, and marketing approaches to local countries. These expatriates often failed to take advantage of the creative skills of their local teams and thus were unable to meet the unique needs of local markets. Consequently, they couldn’t compete with skilled local companies with deeper understanding of local consumers.</p><p>To maximize growth in emerging markets, companies are recognizing they require greater diversity in their decision-making ranks rather than dominance by headquarters nationals. As a result, they are opening up their executive ranks to the best leaders from around the world, without preference for home country executives. Unilever’s chief operating officer, Harish Manwani, says, “If 70 percent of our future business comes from emerging markets, then 70 percent of our leaders must come from emerging markets.”</p><p>Yet even the most progressive companies are struggling to develop top global leaders from emerging markets. Under the leadership of former CEO Daniel Vasella, M.D., and CEO Joe Jimenez, Switzerland-based pharmaceutical company Novartis has been one of the most progressive in expanding its executive ranks beyond its historic Swiss management. Today, its nine-person executive committee consists of four Americans, including CEO Jimenez, two Swiss, and a Belgian, Briton, and German. Yet neither Vasella nor Jimenez considers Novartis’s top team as global. Says Vasella, “We won’t be global until we have a Chinese, an Indian, and a Latino as well as more women.” Adds Jimenez, “It’s not because we aren’t looking, but we haven’t been able to develop them.”</p><p>“The big difference between global executives and Americans who have never worked outside America,” continues Jimenez, “is respect for cultural differences. I have seen many people who can’t become global leaders because all their decisions are steeped in their home country’s culture.”</p><p>It isn’t just American companies that are dominated by local nationals. Even at Japanese, Indian, Chinese, and German companies it is rare that a non-national executive breaks into the company’s top ranks. As Siemens’ CEO Peter Loescher said in 2008, “Siemens is not achieving its full potential on the international stage because its management is too white, too German, and too male. If you don’t reflect your global client base, you cannot achieve your full potential.”</p><p>Historically, companies focused on sending promising leaders from their home country overseas for developmental assignments to position them for key corporate positions. That relegated foreign executives to being country managers and didn’t prepare them to run global business units or reach the top executive ranks. Meanwhile, many foreign nationals who came to headquarters for development faced “tissue rejection” when they returned home.</p><p><strong>Developing Global Leaders with Global Intelligence</strong></p><strong>Developing Global Leaders with Global Intelligence</strong><p>To address these challenges, leading-edge companies are developing a new generation of global leaders effective anywhere in the world. They recognize that ultimately the diversity of their top leaders must reflect the diversity of their customers. Developing these new global enterprise leaders will require different types of experiences combined with leadership development programs vastly different from today’s corporate training programs. The shortcomings of many global leaders—and subsequent failures—usually result from the lack of leadership capabilities that together make up what we call “global intelligence” (GQ).</p><p>GQ consists of seven elements, all of which are essential for global leaders:</p><ul>\n<li>Adaptability to changing world</li>\n<li>Self-awareness</li>\n<li>Cultural curiosity</li>\n<li>Empathy</li>\n<li>Alignment</li>\n<li>Collaboration</li>\n<li>Integration</li>\n</ul><li>Adaptability to changing world</li><li>Self-awareness</li><li>Cultural curiosity</li><li>Empathy</li><li>Alignment</li><li>Collaboration</li><li>Integration</li><p>Let’s explore each of these seven characteristics.</p><p><strong>Adaptability to Changing World</strong></p><strong>Adaptability to Changing World</strong><p>Being a global leader today requires understanding the world and anticipating changes ahead. Global leaders must be able to respond quickly to the rapidly changing global context by shifting resources to opportunity areas and developing contingency plans to cope with adverse geopolitical situations.</p><p>Novartis’s Vasella, who spent his formative business years working in the U.S., is an example. He is a visionary who built Novartis from the outset of the 1996 merger of two mid-sized Swiss pharmaceutical companies (Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy) into one of the world’s leading health care companies. His strategic initiatives, such as moving research headquarters from Basel, Switzerland to Cambridge, Massachusetts to tap into top scientists at MIT and Harvard, were well ahead of their time. Vasella also foresaw the need to move from a Swiss-dominated management team and board of directors to a global leadership team, without regard to nationality.</p><p><strong>Self-Awareness</strong></p><strong>Self-Awareness</strong><p>To understand how they will react to the cultural differences they encounter in emerging markets, global leaders must understand their strengths, vulnerabilities, and biases, starting with recognizing the dominant paradigms they grew up with versus those of their headquarters organizations. It requires humility to recognize that other cultures often have better ways of doing things embedded in their cultural norms.</p><p>When I was president of Honeywell Europe in the 1980s, the corporation sent American expatriates to Europe to transfer U.S.-based marketing programs as well as engineering and manufacturing expertise. A number of them were insensitive to significant differences in these markets and were intent on imposing U.S. practices. I asked INSEAD Professor Andre Laurent to create a program for Americans to help them understand these cultural differences. He proposed two days on American culture before getting into European cultures, because “Americans rarely understand their own cultural biases, and assume their ways are superior ‘if only the Europeans understood.’”</p><p><strong>Cultural Curiosity</strong></p><strong>Cultural Curiosity</strong><p>Global leaders must be curious about myriad cultures and understand how they operate and have the humility to recognize what these cultures offer their organizations. This requires an insatiable desire to learn about these cultures.</p><p>When many corporate executives visit India or China, they stay in international hotels, eat Westernized cuisine, and spend their time in offices reviewing presentations. As a result, they learn little about the local culture. Far better to get into the countryside, stay in local hotels, eat at local restaurants, and talk with local people. I learned how important it is to do this in 1975 by living for three weeks in a one-room apartment with my wife and two-year-old son in all-Japanese area of Tokyo. Each day, we learned what middle-class life in urban Japan was like.</p><p>On my first trip to China in 1984, I spent 10 days in the countryside negotiating a joint venture. Awakened one morning by cowbells, I saw farmers leading their oxen to market. When I went to the market, I found the government market and the private market. Asking a local which had better produce, he explained, “Obviously, the private market where prices are higher, as farmers sell their required quotas at fixed prices in the government market.” This was the beginning of Deng Xiaoping’s new elite farmers. Had I stayed at Westernized hotels in Tokyo and Beijing, I never would have gained critical insights into each culture.</p><p><strong>Empathy</strong></p><strong>Empathy</strong><p>Empathy is the ability to walk in someone else’s shoes. It requires engaging people from different cultures on a personal level, rather than standing back and judging them. Empathy builds rapport through bonding on a human level and the building of lasting relationships. Only with empathic understanding are leaders able to engage colleagues from different cultures and empower them to achieve exceptional performance.</p><p>On my first visit to India, I conducted a “Medtronic Mission and Medallion Ceremony” for several hundred Indian employees, giving each a bronze medallion symbolizing Medtronic’s mission. Afterward, they asked me to plant a tree honoring them with my visit. Rather than a simple tree-planting, this was a traditional Indian ceremony, complete with painting my face, washing my hands, and talking with a native healer. Meanwhile, the employees stood with rapt attention to observe how I was responding to their tradition.</p><p><strong>Alignment</strong></p><strong>Alignment</strong><p>Global leaders need to align employees around the company’s mission and values with a commitment that transcends national and cultural differences. Achieving alignment is far more difficult in emerging markets because local employees are being asked to put company values ahead of their native values, often in cultures where ethical standards differ sharply from the company’s. However, this does not mean giving up their culture and their norms, as norms can differ widely, provided that employees commit to the company’s ethical standards and business practices.</p><p>Global leaders like former IBM CEO Sam Palmisano understand it isn’t possible to write a code of rules and regulations covering every context. In launching IBM’s 2003 “values jam,” he wrote, “In this world of intense scrutiny, one reaction is to create more processes, controls, and bureaucracy. A better alternative is to trust the values that bind us together in the absence of controls. Values provide the framework to make decisions when procedures aren’t clear, using judgment based on values.”</p><p>Gaining alignment requires frequent face-to-face meetings in myriad countries to understand how the mission and values translate locally. Alignment is the only tool that inspires organizations to achieve superior performance and unites them in difficult times. The ability to achieve alignment in complex global organizations is the trademark of exceptional leaders.</p><p><strong>Collaboration</strong></p><strong>Collaboration</strong><p>In the global context, collaborative leaders create horizontal networks that cut across geographic lines, unite people around common goals, and create a modus operandi that transcends geographic goals. This requires putting the company’s and project’s goals first, and working in partnerships to achieve them. The most successful geographic collaborations are orchestrated by leaders who know the strengths and weaknesses of each geographic group and make assignments that take advantage of their relative strengths.</p><p>When Bangladesh-born Omar Ishrak became CEO of Medtronic in 2011, the company was struggling to establish itself in emerging markets. He immediately diversified its executive committee by promoting six executives from emerging markets and holding quarterly meetings in Shanghai and Mumbai. In addition, he created new business models for emerging markets to enable locals to gain access to Medtronic therapies.</p><p><strong>Integration</strong></p><strong>Integration</strong><p>The greatest challenge facing global leaders is incorporating local issues into an integrated corporate strategy. Such a strategy enables them to optimize their position in a wide array of local markets in an efficient manner to create sustainable competitive advantage. Doing so requires deep understanding of local markets and the vision to see how their companies can serve their customers in a superior manner by leveraging their corporate strengths. That’s the only way they can outcompete local companies, which often have a cost advantage.</p><p>Unilever’s Manwani takes the tradition of “think global, act local,” and turns it on its head, saying the key today is to “think local, act global.” In his view, all strategies emanate from a deep understanding of local needs, but if they only act local, global companies have no competitive advantage over local suppliers. Rather, they need to create global strategies to leverage their unique strengths to deliver superior solutions for customers.</p><p><strong>Next Generation Global Leaders</strong></p><strong>Next Generation Global Leaders</strong><p>Role models for these new global leaders include executives like Unilever’s Paul Polman, PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi, and Alibaba’s founder Jack Ma.</p><p>Under Polman’s leadership, London-based Unilever, with 170,000 employees in 160 countries, has become one of the world’s most global companies with 55 percent of its revenues coming from emerging markets. Yet Polman acknowledges the company still has a long way to go in developing global leaders as most of its senior executives come from the U.K. or the Netherlands. Since becoming CEO in 2009, Polman has invested heavily in developing global leaders, sending its 600 top executives to London and Singapore for in-house training as authentic global leaders. He says, “In the long-run, the only true differentiation is the quality of leadership of all.”</p><p>PepsiCo’s Nooyi got her university education in India before attending Yale’s graduate school. As CEO since 2006, she has focused on “performance with purpose” to steadily shift PepsiCo’s product portfolio to healthful foods and beverages and meet the needs of emerging markets. She has also diversified her global leadership team with a wide range of nationalities.</p><p>Alibaba’s Ma has emerged as China’s first true global leader. A remarkable visionary who has created over $200 billion in shareholder value, Ma is creating an ecosystem that can serve two billion Asian consumers with products from one million small businesses sourced throughout the world.</p><p><strong>Stepping Up to the Challenge</strong></p><strong>Stepping Up to the Challenge</strong><p>Just as Mark Zuckerberg’s success at Facebook and Daniel Zhang’s promotion at Alibaba herald the rise of younger global leaders, global companies are crying out for a new generation of leaders—regardless of age—to step up to challenging leadership roles. Progressive companies like Unilever, Novartis, PepsiCo, and Alibaba are working hard to develop this new cadre. While ideas will evolve about how to develop them, one thing seems clear: Sustaining success in the 21st century will require global chiefs with sophisticated leadership qualities that operate with high levels of GQ.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>From <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/22/learning-from-starbucks-on-job-creation-commentary.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC</a>, posted July 22, 2015</p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/2015/07/22/learning-from-starbucks-on-job-creation-commentary.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNBC</a><p>Never accuse&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/SBUX\" target=\"_blank\">Starbucks</a>&nbsp;CEO Howard Schultz of being afraid to take on tough issues.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/SBUX\" target=\"_blank\">Starbucks</a><p>His latest effort is aimed at the issue of youth unemployment, which is stuck at 12 percent for people 16 to 24 years of age. This age category includes many young people who dropped out of school and have never been regularly employed. In many cases, they do not have the skills or training required for today’s jobs, even with four million current jobs going unfilled. None of this fazed Schultz, as he organized Opportunity 100,000 to create 100,000 jobs for unemployed youth.</p><p>This time, however, he isn’t taking on such a complex issue alone. In his recent announcement, Schultz said he had commitments from 16 companies that include some of America’s largest employers:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT\" target=\"_blank\">Wal-Mart</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/TGT\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/M\" target=\"_blank\">Macy’s</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/CVS\" target=\"_blank\">CVS Health</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/HLT\" target=\"_blank\">Hilton</a>.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/WMT\" target=\"_blank\">Wal-Mart</a><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/TGT\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/MSFT\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/M\" target=\"_blank\">Macy’s</a><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/CVS\" target=\"_blank\">CVS Health</a><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/HLT\" target=\"_blank\">Hilton</a><p>Schultz is hearkening back to the days of his youth growing up in Brooklyn’s Bayview housing projects. There he witnessed many people, including his father, who were left out of the American dream. Determined to change this, Schultz put together funds to acquire the original Starbucks from its founders in 1987.</p><p>He created Starbucks “to build a company my father would be proud to work at,” adding, “My inspiration comes from seeing my father broken from the 30 terrible blue-collar jobs he had over his life, where an uneducated person just did not have a shot.” Later Schultz provided health-care coverage for all Starbuck’s employees, including part-timers. “I wanted to build the kind of company my father never had a chance to work for, where you would be valued and respected, no matter where you came from, the color of your skin, or your level of education, and a company that linked shareholder value to the cultural values we create with our people.” Today, Schultz has built a thriving enterprise that employs 191,000 people in 22,000 stores, as Starbucks has created $83 billion in value for its investors, including employees who get “bean stock.”</p><p>Schultz’s vision goes far beyond providing first-level jobs to youth. He is equally committed to helping them develop the skills needed to take on higher level, better paying positions. To this end, he has teamed with Arizona State University to establish online training programs for his employees. He and his wife are contributing $30 million toward local job training and mentorship programs. Next month Schultz is kicking off Opportunity 100,000 with a jobs fair in Chicago.</p><p>While Schultz’s initiative will impact only a fraction of the 5.6 million young people who are neither working nor studying, it is a worthy effort to attack one of America’s most persistent problems. The larger issue is the capacity of the American economy to generate sufficient jobs that pay Americans a living wage, not just the current minimum wage.</p><p>America needs to embark on a massive revamping of our training and education systems to prepare our young people for the jobs of the future. Such a program should start in high school and offer students a choice of a college track or a vocational track, much like the German system. This includes apprenticeship programs, such as those created by North Carolina’s Central Piedmont Community College, which has over 20,000 students, with the support of the Germany’s Siemens. If we can train people for skilled jobs in computer graphics and programming, skilled trades like electricians and carpenters, or running complex machines, companies can and should pay them much more for their efforts. In doing so, they can fill many of the four million vacant jobs companies report having.</p><p>That’s the only viable way to attack the pervasive income inequality challenges we face. The goal must be to make the pie larger, rather than legislating what share everyone gets of a fixed pie. In turn, America will become more competitive in global markets, and all our citizens will be able to realize the American dream, just as Howard Schultz has done.</p><p><em>Commentary by Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School and the former chair and CEO of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/MDT\" target=\"_blank\">Medtronic</a>.

      "<p>From <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-george/the-phoniness-of-donald-t_b_7831662.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Huffington Post</a>, posted July 20, 2015</p><a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/bill-george/the-phoniness-of-donald-t_b_7831662.html\" target=\"_blank\">The Huffington Post</a><p>Donald Trump wants to become president. He’s running a campaign based on vanity and ego, not authentic leadership, with some prejudice tossed in. You will have to look far and wide to find a public figure who is less authentic than Trump. Last Saturday he reached a new low when he attacked Senator John McCain’s war record, saying, “He’s not a war hero because he was captured.” While McCain was held captive in the “Hanoi Hilton,” Trump avoided the war through deferments.</p><p>Trump is the perfect illustration of why “you can’t fake it to make it” to become a leader. Running for the nation’s highest office without ever holding an elected position, he is trying to act like a leader without developing himself as an authentic human being. People immediately sense who is authentic and who is not, and Trump doesn’t pass the sniff test.</p><p>Nevertheless, according to Fox News, Trump leads the Republican primary polls. This may say more about dissatisfaction of the electorate than Trump’s qualifications to be president. Without question, a Trump presidency would severely damage our nation. “The Donald” has driven organizations into bankruptcy, made racist slurs, and denied climate change. As a result, a dozen companies recently severed ties with him.</p><p>As a wannabe leader, Trump tries to comb over more than his hair. In the past, he has advocated government health care, an assault weapons ban, and 14.25 percent flat tax on all wealthy Americans. Now he opposes all three. Does he stand for anything, other than promoting Donald Trump?</p><p>In 2012 Trump told Newsmax the GOP wouldn’t win election if it was perceived as “mean-spirited to Latinos.” Contrast that with his recent presidential announcement, “When Mexico sends its people, they’re bringing drugs, they’re bringing crime, they’re rapists.” With that, he stirs up racial prejudice and divides our country.</p><p>Trump’s phoniness stands in sharp contrast to Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. This past Monday, Schultz announced that Starbucks, in partnership with 16 other companies, will hire 100,000 minority youth workers by 2018. In addition, Schultz is putting his money where his mouth is. He and his wife Sheri donated $30 million from their family foundation to fund local job training. Through these initiatives, Schultz is hearkening back to the challenges of his youth by making a commitment to help young people get started. As Schultz said “It’s very personal for me, having grown up in public housing and understanding what it was like to be that poor kid.”</p><p>At Harvard Business School, we have spent the past 10 years in helping develop authentic leaders among MBAs and executive participants. As I describe in my forthcoming book, Discover Your True North, the mark of an authentic leader is being a servant leader who focuses on others. To become authentic leaders, all of us have to make the transition from “I to We” — recognizing that leadership is not about us, but empowering the people we serve.</p><p>Howard Schultz made that transition, which Trump never did. At Starbucks, he’s focused on improving the lives of employees, becoming the first retail chain to offer health care to all employees, including part-timers. Over the past five years, Starbucks has committed to hiring 10,000 veterans, providing in-job training, and paying for employees’ online college education through Arizona State University. Schultz has also been an advocate for same sex marriage, gun control, and improved federal health care. In the absence of federal government action, he believes the business community must take the lead in addressing the jobs crisis.</p><p>Schultz isn’t perfect, but he acknowledges his mistakes and moves on. For example, his “Race Together” campaign this past spring received an avalanche of criticism. In this case he moved too far, too fast to address a highly charged subject, but does anyone doubt that we need to have honest discussions about racial issues?</p><p>On the other hand, Trump has only moved from “I” to “I am running for president.” Where Schultz has focused Starbucks on serving others, Trump has focused his companies on promoting himself. Over the past 30 years, Trump developed multiple products with his name: Trump Towers, Trump Vodka, and my favorite, Donald Trump The Fragrance. In his television show, “The Apprentice,” Trump’s favorite phrase was “You’re Fired,” spoken with all the compassion of a cruel despot.</p><p>In the past, Trump’s self-serving style of leadership was all-too-common. In that era many leaders focused on extrinsic metrics of success: money, power, and fame. Today’s authentic leaders recognize that to be effective leaders they must serve others. They know that empowering others to lead, rather than exerting power over them, is the only way their organizations can be successful.</p><p>Donald Trump’s rise in the polls legitimizes a broken style of leadership. For young leaders, Trump provides the wrong type of model – a self-focused egomaniac. For authentic leaders, Trump insults the humble service they give to their organizations. For the rest of us, Trump represents a well-crafted persona who cannot be trusted.</p><p>As our increasingly diverse nation honors the enormous contributions of newly immigrated Americans, it is a sad commentary that Trump’s racist statements about Mexicans have taken him to the top of the Republican polls.</p><p>Does something smell rotten in this presidential election? It must be Donald Trump The Fragrance.</p><div></div>"

It is derived from your most deeply held beliefs, your values, and the principles you lead by.”</em>&nbsp;— Introduction to&nbsp;<em>Discover Your True North</em></p><em>“True North is your orienting point that helps you stay on track as a leader. It is derived from your most deeply held beliefs, your values, and the principles you lead by.”</em><em>Discover Your True North</em><p>Today, I am launching this new weekly column, “True North Leaders,” in conjunction with The Huffington Post. Each Monday, it will feature leadership insights and the stories of authentic leaders making important differences in the world. We will also take on current leadership challenges and analyze why leaders fail. Most important, the ideas in this column will help you discover your True North, so you can lead authentically throughout your life.</p><p>First, a little personal background about why I believe it’s so important to develop more True North Leaders. After 33 years in the business world, the last thirteen at Medtronic, I set out on a journey to discover my next steps. As part of my search, I spent 18 months in Switzerland teaching business and technical leaders at two leading Swiss institutions before joining the faculty of Harvard Business School.</p><p>It is no secret that there has been a crisis in the business world the past twelve years. While I was in Switzerland, the first corporate crisis — stimulated by the scandals at Enron, WorldCom and other companies — ripped the business world asunder. When Congress passed Sarbanes-Oxley to reform corporate governance in 2003, more than 200 companies announced “accounting adjustments,” some as much as $3 billion. Five years later, the financial crisis hit, triggered by the failure of Lehman Brothers, AIG, Citigroup, Fannie Mae and many leading banks.</p><p>These crises were not caused by the lack of governance procedures or subprime mortgages, but rather by failed leaders.</p><p>What caused leaders to fail?</p><p>In the 1990s many corporations chose the wrong people as CEO. Under pressure from Wall Street to maximize short-term earnings, boards of directors frequently selected leaders for their charisma rather than their character. These leaders put their companies at risk by focusing on the spoils of leadership instead of building organizations for the long-term.</p><p>These stock market pressures boomeranged in the fall of 2008 when many financial institutions became insolvent, forcing the U.S. government to intervene to save the system from complete collapse. The Great Recession that followed depleted the savings of millions of Americans and U.S. unemployment rose above 10 percent.</p><p>As a result, trust in business leaders fell to its lowest level in 50 years. In business, trust is the coin of the realm. The success of any organization depends upon customers’ trust in its products, employees’ trust in their leaders, and investors’ trust in those who steward their funds. Seven years later, public trust in business leaders is still low.</p><p>The positive side of these crises is the high quality of leaders who have emerged. From these debacles today’s leaders learned what not to do. They saw many of their predecessors get caught in the trap of chasing money, fame and power, and learned the perils of putting self-interest ahead of the institutions they served.</p><p>True North Leaders are the antidote to this crisis — people who can lead us through the myriad problems we face. While many of the leaders we feature have accomplished remarkable things, these columns aren’t about their successes, but rather the incredible challenges they overcame in becoming leaders. Through in-depth studies of 170 leaders, we learned their successes are the result of what they learned about themselves through their life stories, their crucibles and their journey to discover their True North.</p><p>These new leaders are bringing about a fundamental transformation in leadership. No longer is leadership about being charismatic, emulating others, or acting like a leader without going through rigorous self-reflection. These leaders learned that being authentic is the most effective and sustainable way to lead.</p><p>The hierarchical leadership style of the 20th century is fading fast in favor of today’s empowering and collaborative leaders. In today’s organizations people want to make meaningful contributions to the world through their work. They seek opportunities to lead now, not to wait their turn as so many did in my generation. They yearn to see their leaders not as figureheads, but as real people, authentically struggling with challenges just as they do.<blockimg src=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/files/images/media-files/BillGeorgeInfographicRevised%20-%20v2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"517\"></blockimg></p><blockimg src=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/files/images/media-files/BillGeorgeInfographicRevised%20-%20v2.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"517\"></blockimg><p>This is not to say that these new leaders are perfect. Far from it. All leaders have weaknesses and are subject to human frailties and mistakes. Yet by acknowledging their shortcomings, their humanity comes through, and they are able to connect with people and inspire them.</p><p>As we examine these leaders, we hope to challenge you to learn more about yourself and your leadership, and to discover your True North. The bottom line is this:&nbsp;<em>You can discover your True North right now.</em></p><em>You can discover your True North right now.</em><ul>\n<li>You do not have to be born with certain traits and characteristics</li>\n<li>You do not need a title or have to be at the top of your organization</li>\n<li>You can step up and lead at any point in your life.</li>\n</ul><li>You do not have to be born with certain traits and characteristics</li><li>You do not need a title or have to be at the top of your organization</li><li>You can step up and lead at any point in your life.</li><p>There are no magic answers here — no seven easy steps. People recognize immediately who is authentic and who is not, so you cannot “fake it until you make it.” Instead, by being authentic and continuing to develop yourself, you can become a True North leader.</p><p>I look forward to going with you on this journey.</p><p><em>Bill George is senior fellow at Harvard Business School and former chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic.

This is the field I’ve been studying since I left the corporate world eight years ago, and I’m convinced that the key to this is compassionate, authentic leadership. We need a new generation of leaders to step forward and provide this new kind of leadership.</p><p>My basic premise is that compassionate, authentic leadership is essential. It’s not just that it’s good to have—it’s necessary for a healthy society. I’m disappointed in my generation of leaders; I believed that they failed in their responsibility. As a result of the failures of leadership in the last decade, there’s been a loss of confidence in our leaders, and a loss of trust. Each of us who takes a leadership role has a responsibility to the people we serve. If we put ourselves ahead of the public, we have failed in our responsibilities and we can cause great harm.</p><p>At my former company Medtronic, which makes medical products, our mission and our meaning was to restore people to full life and health. The way we measured ourselves was not by earnings per share but by how many people we helped. My greatest source of pride is that in the time I was there, we went from 300,000 people per year to 10 million people per year who were being restored to fuller, more active lives through our work. We always tried to convey this meaning to the people in the company, because that’s what inspired them, not the stock price, not the earnings.</p><p><strong>THE CHANGING ROLE OF LEADERS</strong><strong></strong></p><strong>THE CHANGING ROLE OF LEADERS</strong><strong></strong><p>The role of the leader in this century is different than in centuries past. It’s to bring people together around this sense of meaning, purpose, and values. It is a very difficult task, particularly in organizations that span the globe, to gain that kind of alignment where people believe in the purpose of the organization and practice its values.</p><p>The second role of the leader is not to exert power over other people. Many scholars have written about leadership as power. This idea of power suggests a zero-sum game: if I give you power, I have less. But I reject this idea. I think leadership is about empowering people to lead. If we can empower other people to step up and lead, then we have much stronger organizations, and we can all contribute to the best of our abilities.</p><p>Let me give you an example of a woman whom I met at Medtronic many years ago. She was making heart valves. If a human heart valve failed, they could actually take a valve from the pig and use it to replace the failed human heart valve. This woman was the top worker in the plant. When I asked her about her work, she looked at me with passion in her eyes and said, “My job is to make heart valves the save people’s lives. I make one thousand heart valves a year. If one valve is defective, someone will die, and I could never live with the idea that I caused the death of another person.” But she also said, “You know, when I go home at night, what I’m thinking about is that there are five thousand people in the world today who are alive and healthy because of the products I made.”</p><p>This woman is an empowered leader. She doesn’t have a formal leadership role, and she isn’t a supervisor, but everyone looks to her for inspiration. This is the kind of empowered leadership we need to spread more broadly.</p><p><em>—<strong>William George</strong>&nbsp;is a professor of management practice at Harvard Business School, where he teaches leadership development and ethics.

      "<p>As children and young adults, we spend a lot of time in self-reflection. Who am I? What is the point of life? How will I change the world? Although I’d like to say that with age comes wisdom, that isn’t always true. What is certain, however, is that aging brings responsibility. We spend so much effort rushing from work to home to activity that we don’t take the time to think about what it all means. Carl Jung once said, “Your vision will become clear only when you can look into your own heart. Who looks outside, dreams; who looks inside, awakes.” Use these questions to look inside yourself and light the path towards your True North.</p><p><strong>1. What do you think is the meaning of life? Do you live your life accordingly?</strong></p><strong>1. What do you think is the meaning of life? Do you live your life accordingly?</strong><p>Look at these two questions separately, and don’t let your answer to the second question influence your answer to the first. I particularly like physicist Michio Kaku’s thoughts on the matter. He says, “Beyond work and love, I would add two other ingredients that give meaning to life. First, to fulfill whatever talents we are born with. However blessed we are by fate with different abilities and strengths, we should try to develop them to the fullest, rather than allow them to atrophy and decay… Second, we should try to leave the world a better place than when we entered it. As individuals, we can make a difference, whether it is to probe the secrets of nature, to clean up the environment and work for peace and social justice, or to nurture the inquisitive, vibrant spirit of the young by being a mentor and a guide.”</p><p><strong>2. What do you think you were put on this earth to learn? What were you put here to teach?</strong></p><strong>2. What do you think you were put on this earth to learn? What were you put here to teach?</strong><p>We are all both teachers and students. What qualities do you display in your everyday behavior? Those around you are influenced by your actions. You may not have a formal role as a teacher or student, but each of us, particularly those in leadership positions, teaches others through our words and deeds. I often stress the importance of mentorship, and this question is a great way to explore ways in which you can mentor others – and to determine what mentors you might be lacking in your life.</p><p><strong>3. If you had the opportunity to get a message across to a large group of people, what would you say?</strong></p><strong>3. If you had the opportunity to get a message across to a large group of people, what would you say?</strong><p>YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, and other advances in technology give every person the ability to reach a global audience. If you captured the attention of the world, what would you have to say? This requires careful consideration – would you offer actionable advice (“Get screened for breast cancer”) or say something more generic (“Be kind to others.”) What could you say and how would you phrase it to motivate others to take action?</p><p><strong>4. Who or what energizes you? What makes you feel depleted? Do you thrive on chaos, or prefer order?</strong></p><strong>4. Who or what energizes you? What makes you feel depleted? Do you thrive on chaos, or prefer order?</strong><p>While the common definitions of introvert and extrovert focus on how social and outgoing one is, I prefer the theory that extroverts are energized by social interaction, while introverts find large groups more draining and are energized by time alone. Although tools like the Myers-Briggs test can be useful for identifying parts of your personality, you don’t have to define yourself with conventional labels. Determine the conditions under which you are most successful, and then set yourself up accordingly.</p><p><strong>5. Why do you want to find your purpose?</strong></p><strong>5.

Are you truly willing to make changes to your life? It’s much easier to remain where you are, doing the same things day in and day out. Once you’ve discovered your True North, are you prepared to take the necessary steps to steer yourself towards it? It can be frightening to venture into the unknown.

      "<p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/TGT\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>‘s CEO, Brian Cornell, is no stranger to difficult decisions.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/TGT\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a><p>In 1981, Cornell stood in his UCLA dorm room, struggling with the biggest choice of his life. He could attend his college graduation, or he could fly to London to chase the girl who had “absolutely stolen his heart.”</p><p>Thirty-four years later, Cornell faced another difficult decision. While dining with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/CVS\" target=\"_blank\">CVS</a>&nbsp;CEO Larry Merlo, he and Merlo hatched a plan to sell Target’s pharmacies and its in-store clinics to CVS.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/CVS\" target=\"_blank\">CVS</a><p>In both cases, he made the decision to choose the important over the immediate.</p><p>The partnership with CVS represents yet another opportunity for Target to build its business. The transaction frees up resources for growth priorities — wellness and healthy foods, e-commerce, and new store formats like Target Express, small stores near college campuses and in urban areas. The move will also bring more guests to Target stores as CVS owns Caremark, a pharmacy benefits manager with over 70 million users.</p><p>Since taking the helm just ten months ago, Cornell has moved quickly to enable Target to regain its mojo, which had steadily slipped away in the past five years. He did so by making hard choices and refocusing the company on its roots that gave it the cache to be known among guests as Tar-Jay.</p><p>When Cornell took over, Target was not in good shape. Since 2007, the percent of Americans who say they’ve visited a Target store in the past four weeks has dropped by 30 percent, according to Kantar Retail. Its thrust into food was achieving mixed results; its long overdue e-commerce initiative was cumbersome to use; and its expansion into Canada was failing, as that division had lost $2 billion since opening in 2011. Then in December, 2013, the Target data breach burst into the open, affecting up to 70 million of its credit-card users.</p><p>Facing these difficult challenges, Cornell wasted no time in putting them behind him. After spending his first month touring stores, he announced that Target would focus on four key categories: fashion, kids, babies and wellness. Recognizing that Target’s headquarters staff had become bloated, he slashed 2,300 positions. And he ventured into London to recruit Tesco’s Mike McNamara as CIO, giving him a broad portfolio that includes Target’s digital platform, information security, and its omnichannel strategy.</p><p>Cornell’s toughest decision came last January. After visiting several of Target’s Canadian stores, he announced the liquidation of the Canadian division, closing all 133 stores. I realized what courage he had not to throw good money after bad, and to reinvest south of the border. He described the decision as “the toughest of my career.”</p><p>Hard decisions like these characterize great leaders. They build upon their company’s roots and its strengths, and don’t try to do it all. As my Harvard Business School colleague Michael Porter teaches, “Strategy is all about choices and deciding what not to do.” That’s precisely what Cornell has done at Target.</p><p>Freeing up investment dollars is enabling him to sharpen merchandising in focus categories, expand Target’s presence in urban areas with TargetExpress, and invest $1 billion in Target’s digital platform.</p><p>These moves are also enhancing Target’s same-store sales and profitability. Since Cornell took over last August, Target stock is up 40 percent, while rival Wal-Mart has declined 4 percent. As Target’s first CEO to come from outside ranks, Cornell is reaching out to the local community, vowing to continue Target’s policy of giving 5 percent of its pre-tax income to philanthropic causes.</p><p>For Cornell, “It’s all about people.” Upon arriving at Target, he moved from the 26th floor CEO corner suite to a smaller office down the hall. He then moved the majority of the executive team to the 26th floor to make communication easier.</p><p>Brian Cornell has hit nothing but bull’s-eyes in the past year.</p><p>And the girl he chased in 1981? He and Martha have been married for twenty-five years.</p><p><em>Commentary by Bill George, a senior fellow at Harvard Business School and the former chair and CEO of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/MDT\" target=\"_blank\">Medtronic</a>.

The FBI was also looking into how World Cup hosting rights were awarded to Russia in 2018 and Qatar in 2022, according to a U.S. law enforcement official.</p><p>Beleaguered Zurich-based FIFA president Sepp Blatter announced on Tuesday that he would step down just days after being re-elected for a fifth term.</p><p>Before U.S. law enforcement officials brought the charges focused mainly on soccer governing bodies in North and South America, Central America and the Caribbean, speculation and allegations had swirled for years in soccer circles.</p><p>“I’m not surprised there has been so much smoke around this,” Pound said. He said the charges had not touched Asia, Africa or the Middle East and “maybe what is going on in America is just chicken feed in the great scheme of things.”</p><p>Blatter’s departure will not in itself polish FIFA’s tarnished image and rid the organization of corruption, he said.</p><p>“It is a little bit like alcoholism, unless the person involved, the organization involved acknowledges there is a problem you can’t solve it.”</p><p>Harvard Business School senior fellow Bill George, a soccer fan who was once chair and chief executive officer of Medtronic Inc medical technology company, said FIFA needed “a clean sweep.” “The same people can’t set up a new governance.”&nbsp;</p><p>(Reporting by Steve Keating in Edmonton, Canada; additional reporting by Tim McLaughlin in Boston; Editing by Grant McCool)</p>"

In 2012, he persuaded Kraft’s chief executive at the time, Irene Rosenfeld, to abandon its global marketing by spinning off its North American food business and renaming the international company Mondelez.

DuPont has used its central research labs to support all its businesses, providing the breakthroughs that have spurred their growth.</p><p>In 2014 alone, $9 billion of DuPont revenue, or 32 percent, came from internal innovations. Without the steady stream of scientific breakthroughs coming from its central research labs, where will DuPont’s future revenue come from?</p><p>The Peltz proposal is troubling because it mirrors a disturbing trend in which financiers are gutting American research labs that develop tomorrow’s innovations. In reality, they want to increase short-term earnings, see an uplift in the stock price and close out their positions. They are speculators, not investors.</p><p>When a hotel chain increases its short-run profit by neglecting to make necessary repairs, customers eventually stop coming to stay in dilapidated rooms. Similarly, for science-driven companies like DuPont, research and development is at the heart of their growth. Today’s investments lead to tomorrow’s breakthroughs and profits. Cutting R.&amp;D. investments that create innovative new products will leave these companies lagging global competition in years to come.</p><p>From time to time, investors conveniently ignore this fundamental business law. Financial engineers convince managers that they can generate short-term gains and not worry about the future. Allergan, which increased shareholder value 29 times in 16 years, was forced by Valeant to sell to Actavis this year to avoid being dismantled.</p><p>The pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has openly declared it is moving away from basic science. IBM has cut R.&amp;D. the last several years.</p><p>This rarely ends well. Without new products from R.&amp;D., all of them will struggle.</p><p>DuPont currently has a strong, independent board that includes 10 current or former chief executives, chief financial officers or chief operating officers — many of whom have deep scientific and regulatory knowledge.</p><p>What then is the basis for replacing four of these directors with nominees loyal to Mr. Peltz? Among those Mr. Peltz seeks to replace is DuPont’s lead director, Alexander M. Cutler, who is chairman and chief executive of the Eaton Corporation and a highly regarded corporate leader.</p><p>In reality, all that seems to matter to Mr. Peltz is a higher stock price so he can make some money, close out his position and let others pick up the pieces.</p><p>In contrast, DuPont’s chief, Ms. Kullman, is making all the right moves for the company’s customers, employees and shareholders. During her first six years at the helm, DuPont provided a total return to shareholders of 266 percent with more than $13 billion in dividends and stock buybacks to its shareholders. Ms. Kullman’s results far exceed the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 index&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;Mr. Peltz’s own Trian Fund.</p><em>and</em><p>It’s time for DuPont shareholders to give Ms. Kullman a resounding vote of confidence at DuPont’s annual meeting, scheduled for May 13. If they don’t, one of America’s great science companies will be at risk.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>Laws being passed this past week by Indiana and Arkansas to make discrimination legal on basis of religious freedom have stirred up a hornet’s nest of protests across the country, causing the Republican governors of these two states to ask that the legislation be modified.</p><p>While LGBT obviously oppose these laws, many of the most criticism has come from CEOs of the nation’s leading companies. Last Sunday, Apple CEO Tim Cook led off the debate when he penned a powerful op-ed decrying Indiana’s religious freedom law. His decision to speak out was not without risk. Apple products exist in 76 countries where homosexuality is illegal. He wrote:</p><p>“On behalf of Apple, I’m standing up to oppose this new wave of legislation… regardless of what the law might allow in Indiana or Arkansas, Apple will never tolerate discrimination.”</p><p>Other CEOs, wary of similar risk, might have avoided the debate. In the past they have been reluctant to engage in these discussions, for fear of being criticized by their customers and employees, especially those who are evangelical Christians. The business response could have begun and ended with Apple.</p><p>But not this time.</p><p>In the past week, CEOs Doug McMillon of Walmart, Arne Sorenson of Marriott (a Mormon-founded company), Marc Benioff of Salesforce, and John Lechleiter of Eli Lilly (based in Indiana) have come out vigorously against similar laws.&nbsp; Walmart’s McMillon tweeted about a similar law being considered in Arkansas,</p><p>“Every day, in our stores, we see firsthand the benefits diversity and inclusion have on our associates, customers and communities we serve. For these reasons, we are asking Governor Hutchinson to veto this legislation.”</p><p>A few years ago, such public protest would have been surprising.&nbsp;For five years, I sat next to Lord John Browne, then chief executive of&nbsp;British Petroleum (BP), as we served together on the Goldman Sachs board. Browne is gay, yet this was a subject we never discussed. As he wrote in his poignant 2014 book, <em>The Glass Closet,&nbsp;</em>“My refusal to acknowledge my sexual orientation publicly stemmed from a lack of confidence… It is difficult to feel good about yourself when you are embarrassed to show who you actually are.”</p><em>The Glass Closet,&nbsp;</em><p>Increasingly authenticity is seen as the gold standard for leadership. Fortunately, we see more courageous CEOs – willing to take stands for what they believe and for the diversity of their employees. Now, more than ever, it is essential our society treat everyone equally regardless of religion, national origin, race, or sexual preference.</p><p><em>Discrimination for any reason gives a rationale for all forms of discrimination</em>.<strong> &nbsp;</strong>If the law permits business owners to discriminate against gays based on their religious views, what prevents them from discriminating against Muslims or Indians?</p><em>Discrimination for any reason gives a rationale for all forms of discrimination</em><strong> &nbsp;</strong><p>I know firsthand that wading into these debates has its downsides. As CEO of Medtronic in 2000, I spoke out against the Boys Scouts’ decision to prevent gay scouts from joining their ranks. I also supported the Medtronic Foundation’s decision to withhold grants to the Scouts because the Foundation does not fund organizations that discriminate for any reason. I received a lot of criticism from evangelical Christians and former Scouts among Medtronic employees, but it was worth it. Eventually, the local chapters amended their policies to accept all boys regardless of sexual preference, and years later the national organization followed suit.</p><p>It is encouraging that CEOs have taken an active role in this debate. But they can’t do it alone.&nbsp;Leaders from all walks of life, from government officials to civic leaders, need to embrace diversity in all forms. Speaking publicly against discrimination is the first step in that process.</p><p>As Tim Cook wrote in his op-ed,&nbsp;“Men and women have fought and died fighting to protect our country’s founding principles of freedom and equality. We owe it to them, to each other and to our future to continue to fight with our words and our actions to make sure we protect those ideals.”</p><p>To the CEOs who have already spoken out, thank you. Your voices are powerful, and have already forced the states of Indiana and Arkansas to amend their laws. As this national debate shows, there is much work left to do for Americans to accept all people as being equal under the law.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>From <a href=\"http://www.zacharyclayton.com/2015/03/building-business-the-right-way/\" target=\"_blank\">ZacharyClayton.com</a>, posted March 31, 2015</p><a href=\"http://www.zacharyclayton.com/2015/03/building-business-the-right-way/\" target=\"_blank\">ZacharyClayton.com</a><p>Someone recently asked me if it was a disadvantage that Three Ships didn’t have venture capitalists. I laughed and thought about something Jim Goodnight, Founder of SAS, once told me. “I didn’t know what venture capital was when I started SAS,” he said and then paused dramatically. With a big grin, he then pronounced: “I’m sure glad I didn’t.”</p><p>Forty years and $3 billion in revenue run rate later, Goodnight is surely happy to be in control of his destiny. SAS constantly graces the Fortune 500 “Best Place to Work” list and has grown steadily, decade after decade. He doesn’t have to justify to external investors that making investments in employees leads to better results – he just knows that is the case. When managers think like investors (and investors think like managers), good things can happen.</p><p>There are entirely appropriate times to partner with institutional capital. Great companies such as Apple, Google, and Intel all had venture capitalists as backers. However, the wrong type of institutional capital can lead to many kinds of short-term pressures that distort management’s ability to create great long-term results (e.g. “cut R&amp;D to increase margins,” “under-hire to show profit growth –&nbsp;&nbsp;even if it burns everyone out”). In my own career, I’ve seen the destructive effects of how private equity or venture capital firms can let short-termism creep in, creating unnatural moments for the business.</p><p>Here are some principles I thought about when crafting the 3S trajectory:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>We’re creating something that is built-to-last, not built-to-flip.</strong>&nbsp;Shareholders, customers, and employees are all better off if the company never needs to sell. If we’re truly building for the long-term, we don’t need an “exit strategy.” (And this increases the odds that if we ever do sell, it’s only for a great financial offer that is a fit.)</li>\n<li><strong>Sustainable success offers the luxury of an “infinite runway”.</strong>&nbsp;If we are working hard, delivering value to customers, having fun, and growing… we will have an attitude of “Hey, why would we want to sell?” Again, this mindset increases the odds of either great return from continued ownership or a great exit.</li>\n<li><strong>My goal is creating something great, not finance a great lifestyle.</strong>&nbsp;Our current approach of “no dividends/distributions” is a signal that everyone (management, investors, and me) are focused on building a company that has a long-term growth trajectory. The digital marketing transformation will accelerate over the next 10 years and we’re just scratching the surface of the market.</li>\n</ul><li><strong>We’re creating something that is built-to-last, not built-to-flip.</strong>&nbsp;Shareholders, customers, and employees are all better off if the company never needs to sell.

      "<p>From <a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/when-activist-investors-target-strong-companies/?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times DealBook</a>, November 20, 2014</p><a href=\"http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2014/11/20/when-activist-investors-target-strong-companies/?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times DealBook</a><p>Activist investors have the “hot hand” these days. Their calls to break up companies have attracted growing attention, and their hedge funds continue to add new capital. Bill Ackman, for example, netted more than $2 billion on his investment in Allergan. He pressured its board to sell to Valeant, but profited even though the company was ultimately sold to Actavis. Carl Icahn challenged Apple’s cash hoard, while Mr. Ackman dislodged Robert McDonald as chief executive of Procter &amp; Gamble. Chief executives are concerned that their company may be next.</p><p>Fueled by growing funds under management and emboldened by media coverage, the activists have recently shifted their focus to targeting America’s best companies. Why are activists pursuing those companies instead of moribund companies on the wrong track? The lofty strategic rhetoric of the investors notwithstanding, they are looking for quick gains. This may net handsome profits in the short-term, but it places the competitiveness of America’s great global companies at risk.</p><p>Let’s examine four situations among some of America’s best companies — Amgen, PepsiCo, DuPont, and Allergan — to see where activists have it wrong.</p><p><strong>Amgen</strong>&nbsp;Under the leadership of Kevin Sharer and Bob Bradway, Amgen has been a stellar performer. In the past five years, its stock has increased 185 percent. Apparently dissatisfied with this performance, Mr. Loeb wants to break up the company. Break it up? It’s all one business. Centralized research and development fuels innovation that results in a steady array of breakthrough drugs. Amgen has exceptionally high net income margins of 27 percent and generates $6 billion a year in free cash flow, even after investing 22 percent of its revenues in research. Mr. Loeb’s idea of splitting older drugs from newer drugs would destroy one of America’s most productive innovators by taking away the cash it needs to develop new drugs, meet patient needs and fuel the company’s growth.</p><strong>Amgen</strong><p><strong>PepsiCo</strong>&nbsp;When she became chief executive in 2006, Indra Nooyi foresaw the need for healthy foods and beverages — trends currently sweeping the globe — and devised a long-term strategy to broaden PepsiCo’s portfolio. Pepsi’s performance the past three years has been exceptional. Its 52 percent stock price increase is double that of its archrival, Coca-Cola, which is trapped in a single-minded strategy focused on carbonated soft drinks and bottled water. Nevertheless, the activist investor Nelson Peltz is agitating to split PepsiCo in two, just as he did with Kraft. But both Kraft and its spin-out, Mondelez, are struggling.</p><strong>PepsiCo</strong><p><strong>DuPont</strong>&nbsp;Perhaps stung by his inability to influence PepsiCo, now Mr. Peltz is trying to break DuPont into three pieces. Has he not studied what the chief executive, Ellen Kullman, has been doing the past five years? When she took over in 2009, 200-year-old DuPont was a disjointed conglomerate without a clear strategy. Its stock had declined 62 percent since 2000. Ms. Kullman immediately went to work to reshape DuPont’s portfolio for the future, spinning off slow growth, low-margin businesses like performance chemicals and coatings. Now, DuPont is focused on three high-growth, high-margin businesses: agriculture and nutrition, biotechnology and advanced materials. Ms. Kullman is using DuPont’s vaunted central research labs to drive innovation in all three sectors. Her strategy is working. The company’s stock has increased 250 percent since she took the reins.</p><strong>DuPont</strong><p><strong>Allergan</strong>&nbsp;Bill Ackman successfully partnered with Valeant’s chief executive, Mike Pearson, to put Allergan in play and ultimately force its sale to Actavis, but why was that warranted in the first place? Since David Pyott joined Allergan in 1998 as chief executive, he created a more than 2,400 percent increase in Allergan’s stock. Allergan spends 17 percent of its revenues on research and development. These smart research investments have sustained the company’s high growth rate. Valeant’s strategy was to cut Allergan’s research spending to 3 percent of revenues, lower its taxes from 34 percent to 3 percent, and eliminate its executive team — which would ultimately make the company noncompetitive. For what purpose?</p><strong>Allergan</strong><p>In contrast, an outside perspective can be a powerful catalyst for improvement at performing companies that are not performing well. Ralph Whitworth of Relational Investors helped save Home Depot by unseating its chief executive, Bob Nardelli, in favor of Frank Blake, leading to a decade of strong performance. Mr. Whitforth also turned around a dysfunctional board at Hewlett Packard, one that had previously fired three successive chief executives. Likewise, Jeff Ubben of the hedge fund Value Act Capital Management pressured the Microsoft board for change after 14 years of marginal leadership by Steve Ballmer. Since Satya Nadella took over last February, the tech giant’s stock has jumped 75 percent.</p><p>But in the case of strong companies with effective managements, activist attacks are enormously distracting. Executives focus on saving their companies and short-term financial moves, instead of winning global competitive battles, creating great products and building new businesses.</p><p>Trying to break up great companies only weakens one of America’s greatest competitive advantages: the leadership, strength, and adaptability of its global companies. The activists should keep their focus on the underperformers, and work to build the next set of great companies like Amgen, PepsiCo, DuPont and Allergan.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>Yesterday I had the privilege to participate as a speaker at “Celebrating the Life and Legacy of Warren Bennis” at University of Southern California,” along with a number of speakers. It was a moving and upbeat memorial service, done with great grace and elegance, just as Warren lived his life. Warren was a great leadership scholar who have justifiably earned the title of “The Father of Leadership.” Over 600 friends, mentees and admirers joined his wife, Grace Gabe, and members of his family in celebrating this great man. Here are my remarks:</p><p>—–</p><p>University of Southern California, September 30, 2014</p><p>Warren Bennis was my friend, mentor and colleague. I met Warren in the late 1990s, and he has been a loyal friend ever since – always available with positive encouragement and a helping hand. He had an enormous impact on the lives of so many people in just the same way – always with kindness, deep insight, and warmth.</p><p>Warren was a giant in his intellect, his heart, and his spirit. He transformed the understanding of what it means to be a leader. Rejecting the notion that leaders are born with certain traits, Warren opened the door to the real source of leadership: <em>within you</em>. It is <em>who you are</em>. He showed us how leaders develop through their life experiences, are shaped by their crucibles, and emerge ever stronger to take on responsibilities of leadership. As he said, “The process of becoming a leader is similar to becoming a fully integrated human being.” Which is how Warren led his own life.</p><em>within you</em><em>who you are</em><p>In his younger years he worked with some of the finest leadership thinkers of the greatest generation, Douglas McGregor, Abraham Maslow, Erik Erickson, and Peter Drucker. Just as his thinking was influenced by this generation, Warren shaped the thinking of my generation of business leaders, showing us how to develop ourselves as leaders.</p><p>I first encountered Warren’s writing in 1989 when I read <em>On Becoming a Leader,</em> as I was joining Medtronic. It was a revelation: finally, I had found a philosophy of leadership I could resonate with!&nbsp; As Warren wrote: “The most dangerous leadership myth is that leaders are born. That’s nonsense; in fact, the opposite is true. Leaders are made rather than born.” Throughout my years at Medtronic and at Harvard, I have carried his philosophies into my work and teaching.</p><em>On Becoming a Leader,</em><p>Warren’s influence on business leaders was widespread and profound. So many who never had the privilege of knowing him were inspired by his writings and adopted his approach to leadership. Countless CEOs have told me personally what a profound influence he had on their leadership. For that, he is known as “The Father of Leadership.”</p><p>As president of the University of Cincinnati, he said<em>: </em>“I realized my personal truth. I was never going to be able to be happy with <em>positional power</em>. What I really wanted was <em>personal power</em>: having influence based on my voice. My real gift is what I can do in the classroom and as a mentor.” At USC, he found his “sweet spot” for the last 35 years. What other professors do you know who are still teaching at age 89?</p><em>: </em><em>positional power</em><em>personal power</em><p>In December of 2000 I invited him as a guest patient to an annual Medtronic event where he graciously thanked the employees who designed and manufactured his defibrillator. Warren was fond of saying that he had Medtronic “in his heart,” and then would describe how his defibrillator saved his life half a dozen times. I once witnessed this in person at Harvard while he was speaking: The defibrillator went off, and Warren slumped to the ground, dropping his papers. Ever the gracious soul, he picked up his papers, apologized for the disruption, and continued his talk. Ten minutes later when it went off a second time, the Cambridge Fire Department escorted him to safety.</p><p>Warren gave me the courage to embark on a new career of teaching and writing. He was even arranged for us to rent his Cambridge apartment my first semester at HBS. Warren generously shared his ideas on leadership, and was executive editor on four of my books. While writing <em>True North, </em>Peter Sims and I spent five days with Warren going over the ideas and stories in the book. Unlike many scholars who protect their ideas, Warren genuinely wanted us to expand on his and make them fully accessible to the new generation of leaders.</p><em>True North, </em><p>In <em>Geeks and Geezers, </em>Warren described his philosophy with the little known term neoteny: “Neoteny is the retention of all those wonderful qualities we associate with youth: Curiosity, Playfulness, Eagerness, Fearlessness, Warmth, and Energy. Undefined by time and age, older people with neoteny are open, willing to take risks, courageous, hungry for knowledge, and eager for each new day. Neoteny keeps older people focused on all the marvelous undiscovered things to come, rather than on past disappointments. Neoteny gives you a hungry heart. It is a metaphor for all the youthful gifts the luckiest of us never lose.” This describes Warren perfectly, right to his final days.</p><em>Geeks and Geezers, </em><p>This past April Warren asked Penny and me to discuss leadership with him in the next-to-last class he ever taught. While his physical health was declining, his mind was as sharp as ever. Over dinner that evening Penny asked Warren what he would like on his tombstone. He replied, “Generous Friend.”</p><p>Warren, a generous friend is just what you were to me and Penny, to all of us here, and thousands of friends, students, scholars, and mentees whom you influenced with kindness, buoyancy of spirit, and wisdom. We miss you deeply, but will carry your love in our hearts and your wisdom in our work. That may your greatest legacy of all.</p><div></div>"

It ended the day up 38 percent, at $93.89, giving the company a market value of $231 billion. The company set the record for the largest initial public offering in history. Yet Mr. Ma was humble, preferring to talk about building a great company that helps its customers, creates jobs and serves society. “They call me ‘Crazy Jack,’” he said. “I hope to stay crazy for the next 30 years.”</p><p>China’s large and growing economy has made it an increasing economic force over the last two decades, but it had not produced global companies. Chinese businesses focused domestically and mass-produced products for international companies. Mr. Ma is taking a different approach. Alibaba has initially concentrated on China’s enormous markets, but he understands the Internet is a worldwide phenomenon that knows no borders. He believes that Alibaba can compete internationally and across sectors, and intends to serve the American, European and emerging markets. But he said he won’t stop there. He has plans to disrupt China’s commercial banking and insurance sectors as well.</p><p>Asked about his success, Mr. Ma shares his life story. He was raised in humble origins in Hangzhou in the 1980s, just as China was opening up to the West. Growing up, he overcame one obstacle after another. He was rejected at virtually every school he applied to, even grade schools, because he didn’t test well in math.</p><p>He persevered. From age 12 to 20, he rode his bicycle for 40 minutes to a hotel where he could practice his English. “China was opening up, and a lot of foreign tourists went there,” he said. “I showed them around as a free guide. Those eight years deeply changed me. I became more globalized than most Chinese. What foreign visitors told us was different from what I learned from my teachers and books.”</p><p>As a young man, he applied for jobs at 30 companies and was rejected every time. At Kentucky Fried Chicken, 24 people applied, 23 got jobs; only Mr. Ma was rejected. So he became an English teacher at Hangzhou Electronics Technology College. In 1995, he visited America for the first time. “I got my dream from America,” he said. “When I visited Silicon Valley, I saw in the evening the road was full of cars, all the buildings with lights. That’s the passion. My role model is Forrest Gump.”</p><p>Returning to Hangzhou, he and Joe Tsai, now Alibaba’s executive vice chairman, founded the company in Mr. Ma’s modest apartment. They called the company Alibaba because it is “easy to spell, and people everywhere associate that with ‘Open, Sesame,’ the command Ali Baba used to open doors to hidden treasures in ‘One Thousand and One Nights.’”</p><p>Mr. Ma focused on applying his team’s ideas to help businesses and consumers find hidden treasures of their own. Yet he was unable to raise even $2 million from venture capitalists in America. Once again, Mr. Ma persevered. Eventually he raised $5 million through Goldman Sachs. Later, Masayoshi Son of Japan’s SoftBank invested $20 million, making it Alibaba’s largest shareholder. That stake is now worth about $75 billion. Today, the Alibaba companies serve 600 million customers in 240 countries.</p><p>With Friday’s I.P.O., Mr. Ma became China’s wealthiest citizen, worth more than $18 billion. Yet when he asked his wife several years ago whether it was more important to be wealthy or to have respect from business people, he said they agreed on respect. Mr. Ma talks about building the Alibaba ecosystem to help people, a philosophy that is baked into the DNA of the company. At the founding of the company, Mr. Ma issued generous stock option packages to early employees because he wanted to enrich the lives of all involved in his venture. He insisted that Alibaba’s six values — customer first, teamwork, embrace change, integrity, passion and commitment — be placed on the pillars of the New York Stock Exchange the day of the I.P.O.</p><p>For all his success, Mr. Ma has retained his authenticity. He recognizes that leadership is character, and he is focused on building his team. His role model is a well-oiled soccer team where 11 players work together for the success of the team. He would rather hire entrepreneurs than seasoned business executives, who are always looking over their shoulders, trying to please their bosses rather than their customers.</p><p>His own commitment to a cause larger than himself has propelled him onward. “My vision is to build an e-commerce ecosystem that allows consumers and businesses to do all aspects of business online. I want to create one million jobs, change China’s social and economic environment and make it the largest Internet market in the world.”</p><p>American tech leaders like Steven P. Jobs, Larry Page, and Mark Zuckerberg have emphasized technology and product above everything. Not Mr. Ma. “I’m not a tech guy,” he said. “I’m looking at technology with the eyes of my customers, normal people’s eyes.”</p><p>Mr. Ma said this was not just about making money. “I’m just a purist. I don’t spend 15 minutes thinking about making money,” he said. “What is important in my life is influencing many people as well as China’s development. When I am myself, I am relaxed and happy and have a good result.”</p><p>His lighthearted nature has helped create a unique culture and fun atmosphere at Alibaba where employees are given cans of Silly String, encouraged to do handstands to bolster their energy during breaks, and participate in an annual talent show where Mr. Ma sings pop songs. He practices tai chi and uses the nickname “Feng Qingyang,” a reference to a Chinese kung fu guru who trained an apprentice into a hero. Mr. Ma called martial arts “the most down-to-earth way of explaining Confucianism, Buddhism and Taoism,” adding, “They cherish brotherhood, morality, courage, emotion and conscience.”</p><p>He said he worried that China lost an entire generation when Mao Zedong phased out Confucianism and other forms of spirituality. But he said he hoped to restore that sense of values and purpose to the next generation. “It’s not policies that we need, but genuine people,” he said. Asked about corruption in China, he said, “I would rather shut down my company than pay a bribe.”</p><p>He listed three worries: continuing to create genuine value for his customers, working cooperatively with the government and building his team of global leaders. What will he do with his fortune? His big dream is to found a university for entrepreneurs that can create the new generation of Chinese entrepreneurs.</p><p>Jack Ma is a force of nature. He may become the role model for the new generation of global leaders, not only in China, but also throughout the world. “Our challenge,” he said, “is to help more people to make sustainable money that is not only good for themselves but also good for society. That’s the transformation we are aiming to make.”</p><div></div>"

      "<p>From <a title=\"Bill George: Strong female leadership sets Twin Cities apart\" href=\"http://m.startribune.com/business/274943411.html\" target=\"_blank\">StarTribune</a>, September 13, 2014</p><a title=\"Bill George: Strong female leadership sets Twin Cities apart\" href=\"http://m.startribune.com/business/274943411.html\" target=\"_blank\">StarTribune</a><p>What makes the Twin Cities so vibrant and progressive? First, great institutions in business, education, health care, government, the arts and social services. Second, extraordinary leaders who built these organizations.</p><p>While we have had exceptional male leaders, what makes the Twin Cities stand out are the many women who have built these organizations as CEOs, board chairs and presidents. In no other major city have women leaders had as great an impact.</p><p>Many books and articles assert that women don’t have opportunities to succeed in male-dominated organizations. Sadly, far too many cultures systematically deny women opportunities for advancement. Yet a 2012 Harvard Business Review research study found that in evaluations of 7,280 leaders, women were judged better than men in relationships, integrity, developing self and others, taking initiative and driving for results. That’s certainly true of female leaders I have studied.</p><p>Twin Cities leadership doors opened to women long ago. Pioneering female leaders performed so well that gender is rarely an issue today in creating opportunities for talented Twin Cities women. In each sector locally there have been extraordinary women who paved the way for today’s female leaders.</p><p>On Tuesday, the George Family Foundation will honor these and other women leaders — a total of 84 — before the Guthrie’s preview showing of “The Heidi Chronicles.”</p><p>Health care. Minnesota has long been a leader in health care, thanks to Mayo Clinic, the University of Minnesota and Abbott Northwestern Hospital. As chairwoman of Northwestern Hospital for Women, Virginia Piper led the 1970 merger that created Abbott Northwestern. She became a role model for exceptional female leaders like HealthPartners’ Mary Brainerd and Allina Health’s Penny Wheeler, as well as women leading Gillette Children’s, UMN Physicians and UMN Health.</p><p>Government. Coya Knutson became the first Minnesota woman elected to Congress in 1954, setting a standard for progressive government carried on today by Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Rep. Betty McCollum and Mayor Betsy Hodges. In 1977, Rosalie Wahl was the first woman named to Minnesota’s Supreme Court. Wahl’s legal stature gave credence to Kathleen Blatz, the first woman to serve as chief justice; Justice Wilhelmina Wright and Judge Diana Murphy.</p><p>Business. The corporate world was challenging to crack until Marilyn Carlson Nelson took over as Carlson’s CEO in 1998. Nelson, who worked as a volunteer and raised her family before joining the company in 1989, transformed Carlson over the past 25 years. Her leadership example inspires the 11 women leading major Twin City companies, including current Carlson CEO Trudi Rautio.</p><p>Education. Today local educational institutions are dominated by female leaders. That wasn’t the case until 1977, when Reatha Clark King became president of Metropolitan State University. King, a sharecropper’s daughter, was the first African-American woman awarded a doctorate in chemistry by the University of Chicago. She transformed Metro State from a “school without walls” to pioneer combinations of on-campus and online education. Today women lead St. Thomas, Hamline, St. Catherine, Augsburg, Gustavus Adolphus, United Theological Seminary, North Hennepin Community College and the Minneapolis and St. Paul public schools.</p><p>Arts. The Twin Cities’ arts scene is admired throughout the country, thanks in large part to women who have led every major arts institution. The pioneers were Nina Archabal at the Minnesota Historical Society; Luella Goldberg as first female chair of the Minnesota Orchestral Association; and Lyndel King at the Weisman. More recently, Margaret Wurtele led the Guthrie-on-the-Mississippi expansion and Patricia Mitchell transformed the Ordway, just as Olga Viso and Kaywin Feldman expanded the Walker and MIA.</p><p>Social service. While examining Twin Cities social service and philanthropic organizations, it’s hard to find any that haven’t been led at some point by women. Sara Caruso and Lauren Segal built the Greater Twin Cities United Way, which funds vital social services. Today women lead the Minneapolis YWCA, Boys &amp; Girls Clubs, Habitat for Humanity, Lutheran Social Service, and Planned Parenthood. In addition, most of our leading philanthropic foundations are headed by women.</p><p>Twin Cities’ quality of life is indeed much richer because of these and many other women who have led our great institutions.</p>"

Desai is a professor at Harvard Business School and Harvard Law School who has done&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6585&amp;facInfo=pub\" target=\"_blank\">a lot of research</a>&nbsp;on corporate taxes, and wrote the July-August 2012&nbsp;<em>HBR</em>&nbsp;article “<a href=\"http://hbr.org/2012/07/a-better-way-to-tax-us-businesses/ar/1\" target=\"_blank\">A Better Way to Tax U.S. Businesses</a>.” George is a professor at HBS and the former CEO of Medtronic, which has been involved in one of this year’s highest-profile inversion transactions, a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://investorrelations.medtronic.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=251324&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1939883&amp;highlight=\" target=\"_blank\">merger with Ireland-based Covidien</a>.</p><a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6585\" target=\"_blank\">Mihir Desai</a><a href=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Bill George</a><a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=6585&amp;facInfo=pub\" target=\"_blank\">a lot of research</a><em>HBR</em><a href=\"http://hbr.org/2012/07/a-better-way-to-tax-us-businesses/ar/1\" target=\"_blank\">A Better Way to Tax U.S. Businesses</a><a href=\"http://investorrelations.medtronic.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=251324&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1939883&amp;highlight=\" target=\"_blank\">merger with Ireland-based Covidien</a><p>Part of our conversation was recorded for an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/08/how-to-stop-corporate-inversions/\" target=\"_blank\">HBR Ideacast</a>, which you can listen to below. What follows that is an edited, much-condensed transcript of both the Ideacast and the progressively wonkier discussion that ensued after the podcast was done.</p><a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/2014/08/how-to-stop-corporate-inversions/\" target=\"_blank\">HBR Ideacast</a><p><strong>Why have inversions become a big deal lately?</strong></p><strong>Why have inversions become a big deal lately?</strong><p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong>&nbsp;There was a wave in the early 2000s, and we shut them down with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1130&amp;context=jibl\" target=\"_blank\">anti-inversion legislation</a>. Now, instead of just being able to do it by yourself, the rules are such that you really have to have a foreign partner and there has to be a merger. As a consequence we now see these relatively high-profile mergers which facilitate the departure of U.S. companies. We have some of our largest and most innovative companies doing this.</p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong><a href=\"http://scholarlycommons.law.hofstra.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1130&amp;context=jibl\" target=\"_blank\">anti-inversion legislation</a><p><strong>So Bill, is the problem here — if there is a problem here — our corporate tax code or our corporate executives?</strong></p><strong>So Bill, is the problem here — if there is a problem here — our corporate tax code or our corporate executives?</strong><p><strong>Bill George:</strong>&nbsp;The problem is definitely with the tax code. We have a dysfunctional tax code in the United States. We have among the highest tax rates anywhere in the world, and what’s happened is companies are paying taxes on foreign earnings that they generate overseas but they’re not bringing them back to the United States because they don’t want to pay at the U.S. corporate tax rate of 35%. You’ve got some $2 trillion of cash trapped overseas, so companies are looking for ways to use that cash effectively. It’s driven many U.S. companies to buy foreign companies, but in many cases they’d much rather deploy that cash in the United States.</p><strong>Bill George:</strong><p>One very interesting proposal came from Robert Reich, a liberal Democratic economist&nbsp;<a href=\"http://robertreich.org/post/93122315065\" target=\"_blank\">who recommended</a>&nbsp;that the U.S. go to the system that almost all other industrial nations have of just taxing people where they earn the money. Personally I think that would solve the problem.</p><a href=\"http://robertreich.org/post/93122315065\" target=\"_blank\">who recommended</a><p><strong>Mihir, you wrote an article for HBR a couple years ago on how to fix the U.S. corporate tax code, and I think this was one of the things you wanted to have happen. What were some of the other key changes?</strong></p><strong>Mihir, you wrote an article for HBR a couple years ago on how to fix the U.S. corporate tax code, and I think this was one of the things you wanted to have happen. What were some of the other key changes?</strong><p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong>&nbsp;This is the manifestation of two big problems. One is a high rate, and the second is this worldwide system, both of which are highly distinctive relative to the rest of the world. One of the things that’s happened recently is that leading countries like the UK and Japan, which used to look more like us, with relatively high rates and a worldwide system, have left. So now we’re really all alone — and that’s why these transactions are happening more.</p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong><p>A meaningful reform would combine two things. One, a considerably lower rate — and I think you need to get below 25% or 20% for it to be meaningful. And the second, as Bill mentioned, is a switch to a territorial regime. I actually am optimistic that we can get there; there’s a fair amount of consensus about that. The tricky part is where does the money come from to fund all of that, and there I think people divide up. My proposal has two particular sources of revenue-raising: One is that we have now large numbers of pass-through entities, and we have more business income in non-C-corporate form than we do in C-corporate form.</p><p><strong>Like what kind of entities?</strong></p><strong>Like what kind of entities?</strong><p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Those would be partnerships, those would be REITs, those would be subchapter S corporations — LLCs — and they have mushroomed wildly in the last 25-30 years. As a result the only people who pay the corporate tax are these large public multinationals, and that doesn’t make any sense. A small tax on those pass-through entities can help a lot. The second source of revenue is trying to change the fact that corporations report large profits to the capital markets and relatively small profits to tax authorities. If we make it more the case that you have to base your taxes on profit reports to capital markets, that can raise a fair amount of revenue as well.</p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Bill George:</strong>&nbsp;One issue I fear is how much money is going to be lost by the U.S. Treasury. When I’m talking to corporate CEOs, CFOs, and board members, I don’t see the major multinationals planning to bring that cash back to the United States. I was with the CFO of Apple the other day, and they’ve got $140 billion of cash trapped overseas. They aren’t planning to do an inversion, but on the other hand after tax they’re earning less than 1% on that money, compared to over 30% when they invest it in new products and R&amp;D and innovation.</p><strong>Bill George:</strong><p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong>&nbsp;The amazing thing about Apple is they just decided to give back a lot of that cash in the form of dividends and share repurchases, but to fund it they’re not bringing the cash home from Ireland, they’re borrowing close to $40, $50 billion. Tim Cook in his&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/offshore-profit-shifting-and-the-us-tax-code_-part-2\" target=\"_blank\">testimony to the Senate committee</a>&nbsp;said should I borrow money at 1% or should I pay 35% on my repatriated profit? The answer obviously is borrow at one.</p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong><a href=\"http://www.hsgac.senate.gov/subcommittees/investigations/hearings/offshore-profit-shifting-and-the-us-tax-code_-part-2\" target=\"_blank\">testimony to the Senate committee</a><p><strong>One percent vs. 35%, that’s a really big difference. But at some level is there a conflict here, if you’re a CEO of a company — and you were one, Bill — between your obligation to your shareholders and others within your organization to minimize taxes, but then also your obligations as a citizen to not minimize them all the way to zero. What is the dividing line here? Is there one that we can identify?</strong></p><strong>One percent vs. 35%, that’s a really big difference. But at some level is there a conflict here, if you’re a CEO of a company — and you were one, Bill — between your obligation to your shareholders and others within your organization to minimize taxes, but then also your obligations as a citizen to not minimize them all the way to zero. What is the dividing line here? Is there one that we can identify?</strong><p><strong>Bill George:</strong>&nbsp;I’ve just spent many hours talking to Omar Ishrak, the CEO of Medtronic, who is involved in a major inversion, a $43 billion deal to purchase Covidien. The key question I asked him was, “Why are you doing this?” If he’s doing it for tax inversion, he’s got trouble. But he was very clear he was doing it to expand the Medtronic mission of helping patients — the strategy is a perfect fit, and it allows them to invest more money in innovation, ironically, because they can now use the $14 billion they have in cash trapped overseas to invest in the U.S.</p><strong>Bill George:</strong><p><strong>You’ve been critical of some of the other inversions, such as</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/26/us-astrazeneca-pfizer-idUSBREA3R0H520140526\" target=\"_blank\">the Pfizer one which isn’t going to go through</a>.</strong></p><strong>You’ve been critical of some of the other inversions, such as</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><strong><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/26/us-astrazeneca-pfizer-idUSBREA3R0H520140526\" target=\"_blank\">the Pfizer one which isn’t going to go through</a>.</strong><a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/05/26/us-astrazeneca-pfizer-idUSBREA3R0H520140526\" target=\"_blank\">the Pfizer one which isn’t going to go through</a><p><strong>Bill George:</strong>&nbsp;I was quite critical of Pfizer because I thought they were doing it for the wrong reasons. In fact Ian Read, the CEO, in his&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/lawmakers-press-pfizer-ceo-job-guarantees\" target=\"_blank\">testimony to the British parliament</a>, said he was doing it basically for two reasons, one for tax saving through the inversion and on the second to do all the savings he could by cutting people and combining. So I saw that in a very different context.</p><strong>Bill George:</strong><a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/lawmakers-press-pfizer-ceo-job-guarantees\" target=\"_blank\">testimony to the British parliament</a><p>Back to the Medtronic example. Medtronic gets no tax savings. It already has an 18% tax rate and that’s about what they’re going to pay with Covidien. So there’s really no savings to them at the present time, but it does free up cash.</p><p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong>&nbsp;Bill’s example is interesting for two reasons. One is that we’re in such a crazy place that doing something that seems like it’s going to remove activity from the U.S. actually helps the U.S., because of all this capital that’s trapped overseas.</p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong><p>At the same time I do think your question puts your finger on something deep, which is there’s a growing distrust of corporations. When people see corporations doing this, they question their patriotism, as in fact the administration has. Corporations have to be more sensitive to this issue than I think they’ve been.</p><p><strong>Bill George:</strong>&nbsp;There has been a lot of ill will over that and I think companies are going to have to step up and show their commitment to invest in the United States. Because this is the greatest place anywhere in the world to invest in innovation and R&amp;D. As well as investing in social programs through their own philanthropy — I think many companies are stepping those up as well.</p><strong>Bill George:</strong><p><strong>There is this argument from at least a minority of economists that the corporate tax is an abomination anyway, that we should just be taxing the shareholders — as we do, although right now we give them a lower tax rate — and not corporations. Do either of you think there’s any merit to that argument?</strong></p><strong>There is this argument from at least a minority of economists that the corporate tax is an abomination anyway, that we should just be taxing the shareholders — as we do, although right now we give them a lower tax rate — and not corporations. Do either of you think there’s any merit to that argument?</strong><p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Well, yeah, I think there’s a fair amount of merit. And I don’t even know if it’s a minority. The corporate tax is a hard tax to like. It’s a hard tax to like because it’s a second layer of taxation and it’s entity-level taxation. So it’s always going to be dominated by a tax on individuals, because you’re giving another margin for distortion and another margin for evasion.</p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><p>The reason why we might still like one, albeit it a low-rate one, is because without it you can run into some problems with individuals shielding and hiding their own income. Justin Fox Inc. can all of a sudden become a vehicle, if it’s got a zero rate, for shielding a lot of income. So we need a rate, and it’s probably positive.</p><p><strong>One thing that’s really striking is how consistently, in polling, Americans of both parties, of all age groups, agree that the one group in this country that needs to pay more taxes than they do now is corporations.</strong></p><strong>One thing that’s really striking is how consistently, in polling, Americans of both parties, of all age groups, agree that the one group in this country that needs to pay more taxes than they do now is corporations.</strong><p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong>&nbsp;It’s a puzzle. We know that corporations don’t per se pay taxes. That tax is going to be borne by shareholders, workers, or customers. Those are the only people who can actually end up paying the tax. So while people like to think about corporate tax reform as a sop to big business, the reality is that what we know about the corporate tax is it’s most likely borne by workers.</p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong><p><strong>When you say it’s borne by the worker, you mean it comes out as lower wages?</strong></p><strong>When you say it’s borne by the worker, you mean it comes out as lower wages?</strong><p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Exactly right. It’s either the shareholders, the workers, or it’s going to be customers. And those other folks are pretty mobile. The workers aren’t.</p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Bill George:</strong>&nbsp;Just to illustrate that with an example. I serve on the board of Exxon, the world’s the second-largest market cap company. It’s very profitable. I don’t think that’s a bad thing. Exxon pays 45% tax on a global basis. Of course it affects dividend policy, it affects wage policy, it affects everything.</p><strong>Bill George:</strong><p>The real issue in our tax code is we’ve got a huge number of loopholes and a lot of favors given to various industries, and if we were to go to territorial tax system I think there’s a golden opportunity to get rid of a lot of these loopholes.</p><p><strong>When you talk about loopholes, the reason why Apple and Google, they’re the most famous ones, have these massive piles of money overseas is because it’s income that they’ve paid almost no taxes on to any country at all.

There’s $140 to $160 billion of offshore cash, $100 billion of it is in Ireland. Almost all of that $100 billion represents not profits earned in the U.S. but profits earned in Germany and Japan or China or wherever and then potentially shifted to Ireland. Do we care if Apple shifted money from Germany to Ireland? Frankly it’s not clear to me why the U.S. taxpayer cares about that. The German taxpayer should care about that, and the German taxpayer should be worried about it, and they should go after Apple if they want to. But why are we in the business of defending the German taxpayer?</p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong><p><strong>Bill George:</strong>&nbsp;The one area the IRS and the Treasury would have to be very analytical and consistent on is transfer pricing. If companies are going to move technology ownership outside the United States, then you pay a substantial tax on that. That should be enforced. If you make products in the U.S., some of the profits should be captured in the U.S.</p><strong>Bill George:</strong><p>Let me give you specific example. Back in 1996, Medtronic made an arrangement to put a major defibrillator factory in Switzerland. The technology was all created in the United States, so what Medtronic did was sell that technology from Medtronic U.S. to Medtronic Switzerland, and pay a very substantial tax on that in the United States. After that it was governed by the Swiss tax system in terms of the profits made where manufactured.</p><p><strong>With these companies where everything is intellectual property, and there aren’t factories moving from one country to another — Google is the really clear example of that — the tax authorities of the world seem to be struggling with how to do this correctly.</strong></p><strong>With these companies where everything is intellectual property, and there aren’t factories moving from one country to another — Google is the really clear example of that — the tax authorities of the world seem to be struggling with how to do this correctly.</strong><p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong>&nbsp;Absolutely, and one of the interesting things that’s on the horizon is the OECD has something called the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Base Erosion and Profit Shifting</a>&nbsp;initiative. They’re trying to come together and get at this idea of how does intellectual property get transferred and how do we value it. That’s a non-trivial problem.</p><strong>Mihir Desai:</strong><a href=\"http://www.oecd.org/ctp/beps.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Base Erosion and Profit Shifting</a><p>The question politically is do we really think we’re going to get to a place where we have a multilateral organization, like the WTO, in taxes. I think the answer to that is, highly unlikely. That’s just a bridge too far for most people.</p><p><strong>Bill George:</strong>&nbsp;You’re now getting into a much broader and more complex issue. With global corporations, they have to insure that they can be competitive around the world, and still be responsible to the national governments they serve. And there’s no such thing as global laws in many, many cases, including tax law. So you get a great deal of dysfunctionality, and I think this is why we need international bodies to help us work our way through these issues and sort them out.</p><strong>Bill George:</strong>"

      "<p>From <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/business/272195011.html?page=all&amp;prepage=1&amp;c=y#continue\" target=\"_blank\">Star Tribune</a>, August 22, 2014</p><a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/business/272195011.html?page=all&amp;prepage=1&amp;c=y#continue\" target=\"_blank\">Star Tribune</a><p>Medtronic Inc. chief executive Omar Ishrak heard an earful from stockholders who got their first chance Thursday to directly question the company’s planned purchase of an Irish company.</p><p>Medtronic’s $43 billion deal to buy Covidien Inc. has drawn enormous media and political scrutiny as one of a growing number of U.S. companies purchasing firms in countries with lower tax rates, then relocating their legal headquarters abroad to take advantage of those rates.</p><p>For Medtronic’s shareholders, there’s another issue to the deal: Its structure creates a surprise taxable event for them — one that could cost thousands of dollars depending on how many shares they own.</p><p>Their complaints enlivened the company’s annual shareholder meeting, an event that is usually a formal discussion of numbers and new medical gadgetry.</p><p>“This is the least shareholder-friendly proposal that I have ever seen,” said Lee Binger, 79, of Maple Grove, drawing hearty applause from the crowd of 500 during the meeting’s Q&amp;A period.</p><p>As Ishrak listened, Binger said he would have to sell much of his Medtronic stock to pay a tax on his capital gains — the difference between what he originally paid for the shares and their value at the time the Covidien deal closes. The tax is triggered because the deal effectively dissolves Fridley-based Medtronic Inc. and its stock. Shareholders would sell their stock and, in exchange, get shares in a new company called Medtronic PLC. Since Medtronic stock has performed well in recent years, people who bought at low prices decades ago face much greater sticker shock than institutional investors which buy and sell more frequently.</p><p>On Thursday, Medtronic shares closed at $64.10, not far from their all-time high of $65.50.</p><p>In response, Ishrak laid out the rationale for the deal in many of the same terms he has used since it was announced in June. He said Medtronic will reap long-term benefits through the acquisition, including the potential for greater profit that would raise the value of the investors’ new shares.</p><p>“There is a pain here, which I understand, and I don’t deny,” he said.</p><p>The Covidien deal is expected to close by early next year, but it could happen before the end of this year. The Federal Trade Commission is investigating the sale, and the Treasury Department is expected to propose rules soon to discourage such deals, known as “corporate inversions.”</p><p>Uncertainty about which tax year the deal would close also irritated attendees at the meeting. Others were upset that Medtronic is planning to cover an estimated $65 million in special excise taxes that apply to board members and officers of the company. Still other critics said they may not live long enough to see enough of a gain in the value of the new Ireland-domiciled company to make up for the immediate capital gains tax hit.</p><p>The meeting, held at a Medtronic office in Mounds View, kicked off with a presentation on how Medtronic products extend lives. But the question-and-answer session dealt mainly with the tax issues surrounding the Covidien deal.</p><p>At one point, Ishrak was heckled when he announced he would take only one more question, even though many hands in the crowd were still raised. He eventually relented and called on another half-dozen speakers.</p><p>Retired attorney Donald Zibell, 77, of Shoreview was skeptical that the deal would benefit him. He estimated that the stock price of the new Medtronic would have to rise by $17 a share in order to make up for the tax he will have to pay.</p><p>Medtronic executives suggested that stockholders could reduce their tax burdens by donating part of their holdings to charities or family trusts, rather than selling them. Former chief executive Bill George said that’s what he intends to do to defray the estimated $1.5 million in taxes he will face.</p><p>George said the inversion would trigger taxes that he and all investors would have eventually faced anyway.</p><p>“The stock has doubled since Omar came on board three years ago,” he said, referring to Ishrak. “I think this is the launchpad for the company to go to the next level.”</p><p>At the meeting, Ishrak also confronted criticism that the deal would allow Medtronic to avoid U.S. taxes. After the transaction is concluded, he said, the company will still pay the same tax rates on dollars earned in the United States that it does today.</p><p>One of the key motives of the deal, he said, is to allow Medtronic to bring $14 billion in foreign-held cash back into the United States without paying this country’s 35 percent corporate tax rate. Avoiding those taxes would allow the company to invest $10 billion in U.S. facilities that it could otherwise not afford under a traditional acquisition, Ishrak said, repeating an oft-heard pledge about the deal.</p>"

      "<p>Returning to Berlin for the first time in several years, it is remarkable to see this great city progress as the cultural center of Germany. Penny and I had the privilege of staying at the magnificent Adlon Hotel as our hotel room looked out on Brandenburg Gate, the former dividing line between East and West Berlin. I still have vivid memories of standing under the gate on October 3, 1990 – the day of German reunification – when Maestro Leonard Bernstein conducted the Berlin Philharmonic playing Beethoven’s 9<sup>th</sup> Symphony with its glorious “Ode to Joy.”</p><sup>th</sup><p>Some thoughts on our impressions of Berlin circa 2014:</p><ul>\n<li>I wish I could have been here on Sunday, July 13 for the spectacular triumph of the German soccer team as 250,000 Germans watching on large screens on Unter Den Linden saw young&nbsp;Mario Götze’s&nbsp;brilliant goal in the 113th minute to bring the World Cup back to Germany.</li>\n<li>Two days later 400,000 Germans gathered to greet their heroes as the team arrived home from Rio. Prior to landing at Berlin’s Tegel airport, their airplane did a flyover and wiggled its wings to salute the cheering masses. What a contrast with the 1930s …</li>\n<li>Speaking of the 1930s, German contrition and ownership of the terrors of the past are present everywhere, but no more apparent than at the stunning and horrifying Topography of Terror. This museum documents the shame of the past without pulling any punches. Just one block from Brandenburg Gate is the haunting Holocaust Memorial, with its images of large blocks protruding from the grounds (representing those who died in the Holocaust?). As horrifying as these monuments are, one has to credit the German people for owning the sins of their past.

      "<p>On Sunday, Germany became the champion of the soccer world, winning the World Cup for the 4<sup>th</sup> time, defeating a rugged Argentina team with Lionel Messi as its star. Germany’s surge through the tournament – undefeated in seven games with only a tie with Ghana marring its record – wasn’t a fluke, nor was it lucky. It was the result of 14-year rebuilding program that began in 2000 when soccer was at a low point in Germany’s vaunted history.</p><sup>th</sup><p>In 2000, Germany had been embarrassed by being ousted in the group stage of the European Cup, finishing in 14<sup>th</sup> place. Its aging greats were retiring and no young stars were emerging. When Coach Erich Ribbeck resigned, the German Federation decided it needed to overhaul its entire player development system. It took 14 years for these decisions to pay off fully. On Sunday Germany’s dreams were fulfilled, thanks to 22-year-old Mario Götze’s brilliant goal in overtime, assisted by 23-year-old André Schürrle, both of whom entered the game as substitutes.</p><sup>th</sup><p>Here are five lessons that business leaders can learn from the German soccer experience that apply to running your business.</p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">#1 – The team is more important than any individual</span>.</strong> This maxim was evident throughout the tournament as Germany prevailed over such extraordinary individuals as Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo, holding both scoreless. The German victory was definitely a team effort, thanks to the coaching of Joachim Löw, who took over in 2006. Germany was such a well-unified team that FIFA could not single out one player as MVP, so it gave the award to a disappointed Lionel Messi. Is your organization truly a team effort, with the leader as coach, not director, or is it directed from the top? If the latter, you will never get the best efforts from your teammates or enable them to develop fully.</p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">#1 – The team is more important than any individual</span>.</strong><span>#1 – The team is more important than any individual</span><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">#2 – Develop a broadly-based cadre of emerging stars for the long-term</span>. </strong>Germany’s youth movement was launched by former star Jürgen Klinsmann, now coach of the U.S. national team, when he became coach in 2004. It has been carried on by his former assistant and now head coach, Joachim Löw, for the past 8 years. They deserve credit for producing such great players as Thomas Müller (24), Mesut Özil (25), Toni Kroos (25), Jérôme Boateng (25), Mats Hummels (25), and Benedikt Höwedes (26) as well as Götze and Schürrle. Business leaders need to think less about immediate succession plans and more about long-term development of outstanding future leaders. That takes intense work with young leaders in their twenties and thirties who will have the breadth and depth of leadership experiences to be prepared for top-level assignments.</p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">#2 – Develop a broadly-based cadre of emerging stars for the long-term</span>. </strong><span>#2 – Develop a broadly-based cadre of emerging stars for the long-term</span><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">#3 – Rely on your veterans, but give emerging stars their chance to shine</span>.</strong> Unlike Klinsmann who dropped Landon Donovan, America’s all-time leading scorer at age 32, Löw moved 36-year-old Miroslav Klose, Germany’s all-time leading scorer into the starting lineup, for the final two games. He responded with the winning goal against Brazil, making him the leading goal scorer in World Cup history. Yet when Germany desperately needed a goal with the clock ticking down, Löw called on young Götze, who responded with the goal that won the Cup. All too often, business leaders fail to take risks on their best young leaders by giving them the big opportunity to step up in the most challenging situations. An exception is former Novartis CEO Dan Vasella, who promoted two leaders in their thirties to run the company’s most challenging divisions.</p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">#3 – Rely on your veterans, but give emerging stars their chance to shine</span>.</strong><span>#3 – Rely on your veterans, but give emerging stars their chance to shine</span><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">#4 – As the coach, position your players in their “sweet spot” on the field</span>.</strong> The key to leading a business organization or team is very similar to soccer: the leader needs to ensure that the players are positioned on the field in their optimal positions, where their strengths can be maximized and their weaknesses not exposed. That’s what Germany’s Löw did in starting three forwards, while keeping his rock-solid defenders in place. Midway through the tournament he made a key tactical move to get Captain Philipp Lahm back to his “sweet spot” at left defense, moving Bastian Schweinsteiger to center midfield, which strengthened both positions. Business leaders need to ensure they get their key leaders into the right positions so their strengths can be fully utilized.</p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">#4 – As the coach, position your players in their “sweet spot” on the field</span>.</strong><span>#4 – As the coach, position your players in their “sweet spot” on the field</span><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">#5 – You’re building for the long-term, but you must win today’s game</span>.</strong> Business leaders often complain about the pressures of quarterly earnings reports while they are investing for the long-term. Every great soccer coach knows you have to win today’s game to have a shot at building for the long-term. As well as Germany has done in developing its cadre of talented players, it still had to beat Argentina to establish its success. Had it lost in a shootout, I doubt everyone would be hailing German soccer today. It’s the same for companies: performance matters. But the key is not to win a single tournament or have a great year; it’s to sustain that performance year-after-year. As in soccer, that’s hard to do with new competitors constantly nipping at your heels. Most important of all, it is essential to invest in your people for the long-term, and to know how to use an aging star like Klose and when to trust a young star like Götze.</p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">#5 – You’re building for the long-term, but you must win today’s game</span>.</strong><span>#5 – You’re building for the long-term, but you must win today’s game</span><div></div>"

For example, if you bought your stock three years ago when Omar Ishrak became CEO, your gain is 65%.

      "<p>Credit German-born Jürgen Klinsmann for turning U.S. Soccer into America’s Team.</p><p>While the Australians have their national rugby team and the Brazilians, Spanish and Germans have their national soccer teams, Americans have only had professional sports teams representing their cities. No wonder Europeans are so passionate about their national teams while Americans focus on the Dallas Cowboys, New York Yankees, Boston Celtics and Chicago Blackhawks.</p><p>Now that has changed. In less than a month, the gritty, determined 23 athletes chosen by Klinsmann to represent America in the World Cup have captured the hearts of America. Never before have Americans turned out in such record numbers to watch any team – pro or national – play four consecutive games. Never before have so many fans gathered in groups to watch an American national team. And in a country 5,000 miles away no less! Over 40,000 watched the games on large screens in Chicago’s Grant Park. America’s first game against Ghana attracted 16.9 million television viewers, making it the second-most-watched sporting event of the year. Tuesday’s game against Belgium attracted over 23 million viewers – an all-time record.</p><p>Klinsmann did so by cobbling together a group of players from all over the world, including seven dual-nationality players, into a cohesive fighting force that battled to the very end of every contest, including an exhausting, non-stop 120 minutes against Belgium in last Tuesday’s 2-1 overtime loss. They learned to play “The Klinsmann Way” – attacking the ball all over the field with non-stop running and collective defense.</p><p>In reality, America’s soccer talent cannot come close to comparing with the world-class stars fielded by Germany, Belgium, Ghana or Portugal. Yet the U.S. survived the most difficult group in the tournament, the so-called “Group of Death,” and advanced further than more talented teams like Spain, Italy and England. All because Klinsmann instilled the tactical discipline, physical conditioning, positive psychology and teamwork necessary to compete toe-to-toe with the best players in the world. The team performed strongly even without without striker Jozi Altidore, who played only 22 minutes of the Ghana game before pulling his hamstring, and Landon Donovan, who would have added much more offensive punch than side midfielders like Brad Davis, Graham Zusi and Alejandro Bedoya.</p><p>When he took over U.S. Men’s National Team in 2013, Klinsmann knew he didn’t have the talent to compete at the highest level. So he challenged America’s best players like Michael Bradley, Tim Howard, and Clint Dempsey to elevate their games, while integrating no fewer than seven dual-nationality players into the national team: German-Americans Jermaine Jones, Fabian Jones, and youngsters John Brooks and Julian Green; Norwegian-American Mix Diskerud, Icelantic-American Aron Jóhannsson, and Alejandro Bedoya of Columbian descent.</p><p>Unlike his predecessors Bob Bradley and Bruce Arena, Klinsmann isn’t just preparing for World Cup competition, but building American soccer for the long-term to the level of the best countries in the world. With his new four-year contract which adds the role of “technical director” for the first time, America has someone responsible for developing the cadre of talented youth players who can compete with the best in the world. In an encouraging sign of what’s to come, the U.S. Under-17 team has won four international competitions.</p><p>The good news is that Americans won’t have to wait four more years to see their new national favorites in action. Next July the U.S. will compete in the CONCACAF Gold Cup, a tournament it won in 2013, with a chance to qualify for the Confederations Cup in 2017 against the world’s best teams. Thanks to Klinsmann’s negotiating skills, the U.S. will host Copa America for the first time in June 2016 against the best national teams from South America (e.g., Brazil, Columbia, Argentina, Chile, Uruguay), the Caribbean and North America. All of this action with Klinsmann at the helm will prepare America to advance further in the 2018 World Cup in Russia. Meanwhile, thanks to Don Garber, Major League Soccer continues to grow in quality with the addition of Bradley, Dempsey, and Brazilian star Kaka as well as fan attendance and the addition of more franchises in cities like Miami and Orlando.</p><p>The future of soccer is brighter this summer. For the first time we can say with confidence that professional soccer is here to stay, and that Klinsmann’s troops have become America’s Team!</p><div></div>"

Young fails to comprehend that Medtronic’s acquisition of Covidien is being done precisely to benefit all of its stakeholders: customers, employees, shareholders and communities. Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak justifies the Covidien acquisition because it extends Medtronic’s mission to 5 million more patients annually. Let’s examine the actual impact on stakeholders:</p><p>Customers: Since 1989, Medtronic has expanded from restoring 300,000 patients annually to 10 million today. With Covidien, 15 million patients will be restored annually. Combined R&amp;D budgets of $2 billion per year will produce breakthrough therapies to help more patients. The combination gives Medtronic nearly $4 billion in emerging market revenues to make its therapies more affordable and this enables it to serve U.S. hospitals more efficiently.</p><p>Employees: The acquisition gives Medtronic 87,000 employees who enjoy good-paying jobs, health care and retirement, including 9,100 in Minnesota.

This shift won’t change its 18 percent tax rate, but gives Medtronic access to $14 billion in cash trapped overseas plus future cash flows of $7 billion annually. Medtronic already has paid local taxes on these earnings, so it isn’t avoiding taxes on them, and it continues paying U.S. taxes on all U.S.-generated revenues.</p><p>Medtronic has committed to reinvesting $10 billion of these funds in new ventures and technology acquisitions, because management believes the U.S. is the world’s best place to invest in medical technology and entrepreneurs pursuing innovative medical therapies.</p><p>The litmus test for me is: Would I have done this deal if I were still CEO of Medtronic? My answer is an emphatic “yes.” Credit Ishrak for having the courage to seize this golden opportunity to extend Medtronic’s mission and be a powerful voice in improving health care globally.</p><p>Bill George</p><p><em>The writer is professor of management practice at Harvard Business School, author of “True North” and former chairman and CEO of Medtronic.</em></p><em>The writer is professor of management practice at Harvard Business School, author of “True North” and former chairman and CEO of Medtronic.</em><div></div>"

      "<p>The headline in the Op-Ed in Sunday’s Minneapolis Star-Tribune blared, “It’s shareholders over stakeholders for Medtronic.” Nothing could be further from the truth.<em>&nbsp;</em></p><em>&nbsp;</em><p>Medtronic’s acquisition benefits <em>all</em> of its stakeholders: its customers, employees, shareholders, communities and society as a whole. I spoke at length with Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak on Friday evening about these issues, as well as prior to the acquisition announcement. Omar is as committed to the Medtronic Mission as any CEO since founder Earl Bakken, myself included. For Omar, the Covidien acquisition expands the Medtronic Mission of contributing “to human welfare by the application of biomedical engineering to alleviate pain, restore health, and extend life” – to more patients. When Bakken penned the Mission in 1960, he intentionally covered all aspects of human health.</p><em>all</em><p><em>A Deal That Benefits All Stakeholders</em></p><em>A Deal That Benefits All Stakeholders</em><p>Let’s look at the impact on each group of Medtronic stakeholders:</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Customers</span>: When I joined Medtronic in 1989, the company was restoring 300,000 new patients every year to health. During the past 25 years that number has grown to more than 10 million patients per year. Now, with the Covidien acquisition, Medtronic will be able to restore more than 15 million patients annually. Patients will benefit enormously from therapies originally created by Covidien that treat cancer, gastro-intestinal, respiratory, peripheral vascular and neurovascular diseases. The combined company will have a Research &amp; Development budget of more than $2 billion per year (5x the annual <em>revenue</em> of Medtronic when I first joined). This R&amp;D capability will produce a wide range of new therapies that help patients in the years ahead.</p><span>Customers</span><em>revenue</em><p>To be clear, many of these therapies are innovations that create entirely new markets – restoring patients who otherwise had few alternatives. Adding Covidien’s $1.6 billion revenues in emerging markets to Medtronic’s $2.1 billion will enable the company to serve emerging markets at scale, making these therapies more affordable for all and expanding patient access to life-saving therapies.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Employees</span>: When the acquisition is complete, Medtronic will employ 87,000 people with well-paying jobs and full health care and retirement benefits. Its home state of Minnesota will benefit from an additional 1,100 Covidien employees currently in Minnesota. All of these employees, regardless of origin, will be brought into the Medtronic Mission that offers them “a means to share in the company’s success.”</p><span>Employees</span><p>Moreover, the improved competitive position of the combined company will increase the long-term opportunities available for employees.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Shareholders</span>: Since the announcement, Medtronic shareholders have enthusiastically embraced this deal, bidding up Medtronic stock $3.16 to $63.86, or 5.2%. That’s in sharp contrast to most deals where shareholders sell the acquiring company’s stock and buy stock in the acquired company. Six of the twelve security analysts recommending “hold” for Medtronic upgraded their recommendations to “buy.” Of the 24 firms covering Medtronic, 18 now have “buy” recommendations, 6 “hold,” and none “sell.” Since Ishrak took over as CEO three years ago, the company’s stock is up 65%.</p><span>Shareholders</span><p>Cynics may say gains to shareholders don’t matter, but I respectfully disagree. Strong financial performance sustains a company’s ability to invest in the long-term.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Communities</span>: Medtronic has long been dedicated to the Minneapolis community and all communities where it has large concentrations of employees, consistently giving more than 2% of its pre-tax income to philanthropic and community causes. In addition, Medtronic committed to add 1,000 new jobs in Minnesota as a result of the Covidien acquisition, bringing its Minnesota employment to 10,100. This caused Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton to say the deal is “good news for Minnesota.”</p><span>Communities</span><p>The one community that will suffer is Boston, where Covidien headquarters will be closed, an inevitable consequence of acquisitions. However, Covidien’s main business locations along with Medtronic’s locations can anticipate continuing increases in employment through growth in their businesses. This projection is borne out by the three major acquisitions Medtronic did over a decade ago – Sofamor-Danek, Arterial Vascular Engineering, and Mini-Med – whose employment and R&amp;D investments have tripled in Memphis TN, Warsaw IN, Santa Rosa CA, Galway, Ireland, and Northridge CA.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Society as a Whole</span>: Throughout its 65-year history Medtronic has been dedicated to serving society by improving health for people with chronic disease through its innovative therapies. This acquisition will enable Medtronic to accelerate its new therapies through an expanded R&amp;D budget, extend them to more people in emerging markets, and expand its commitment to make the health care system more efficient.</p><span>Society as a Whole</span><p><em>Addressing the Critics</em></p><em>Addressing the Critics</em><p>There has been much focus—too much focus, I’d argue—on the tax structure of the deal, through which Medtronic will relocate its legal domicile to Ireland. In its latest fiscal year Medtronic paid $640 million in taxes, 18% of profits. By changing its domicile to Ireland, its tax rate will not change materially. Medtronic did not do the Covidien deal to reduce its tax rate: it will still pay full taxes on all income earned in the United States.</p><p>The change in domicile enables Medtronic to utilize the $14 billion in cash trapped overseas as well as invest the $7 billion in annual free cash flow it anticipates in the future. Medtronic had already paid tax on these earnings in the countries where revenues were generated so it is not avoiding taxes on them. Rather, it avoids a form of double taxation – paying the added 35% U.S. tax in addition to foreign taxes on the same revenues, an approach being followed by all other global corporations. Medtronic’s situation is quite common. U.S. companies—including Apple, Google, and others—have more than $2 trillion trapped overseas by the inability to repatriate their earnings without added taxes.</p><p>In an interesting twist, Medtronic has committed to reinvest $10 billion of these funds in the U.S. in new ventures, technology acquisitions, and venture capital – over and above its current strategic plans. Medtronic management believes that the U.S. is still the best place in the world to invest in medical technology and support entrepreneurs pursuing innovative medical therapies.</p><p>In contrast to the <em>Star-Tribune</em> column, the one group that could experience a burden from this deal are current Medtronic shareholders who will owe capital gains taxes when the acquisition is complete. Depending on the cost basis of their stock, this could be significant, as it is for my wife and me. We have devised a solution to this problem that other Medtronic stockholders may want to consider: give Medtronic stock away to philanthropic causes.</p><em>Star-Tribune</em><p>In our case we plan to give our Medtronic stock to the Penny George Institute for Health and Healing at Allina Health and to the George Family Foundation, which gives grants for integrative health, authentic leadership, and vital organizations in our community. To continue to invest in Medtronic’s future, we plan to buy additional Medtronic shares as soon as the deal closes.</p><p>The <em>Star-Tribune</em> Op-Ed columnist has the logic exactly backward. Medtronic’s acquisition of Covidien is being done precisely to benefit all its stakeholders and to further the Medtronic mission. For me the litmus test is this: If I were still CEO of Medtronic, would I have done this deal? The answer is an emphatic “Yes.” Omar Ishrak has demonstrated great courage with this step, making Medtronic an even more powerful voice in improving health care globally.</p><em>Star-Tribune</em><div></div>"

Medtronic has been active in optimizing its international tax position since the 1970s with its Puerto Rico locations. In 1996 Medtronic’s European headquarters was located in Switzerland and its manufacturing position in Ireland was expanded through its 1998 acquisition of California-based AVE.</p><em>not</em><p>Kudos to Omar Ishrak in putting together such an attractive strategy to build the company in exciting new ways and extend its mission to “alleviate pain, restore health, and extend life.” Medtronic’s growth story continues.</p><div></div>"

As well as saving on Medtronic’s tax bill, the acquisition is expected to deliver around $850 million of annual pretax savings by the end of 2018.</p><p>“To finance the deal, they have some $13 billion to $14 billion in cash trapped overseas. They wanted to free that up to use that,” former&nbsp;Medtronic Chairman and CEO Bill George told CNBC on Monday.</p><p>The U.S. company had also been linked to a potential bid for U.K.-listed <a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/SN.-GB\" target=\"_blank\">Smith &amp; Nephew</a>.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/SN.-GB\" target=\"_blank\">Smith &amp; Nephew</a><p>Ireland’s corporate tax rate of 12.5 percent is substantially lower than the U.K.’s 21 percent and the 35 percent in the U.S. Covidien itself is historically based mainly in Massachusetts, but moved its headquarters to Ireland for tax reasons in 2009.</p><p>Medtronic is the latest U.S. company to do a “tax inversion” — move its base overseas for tax purposes, so that overseas revenues will be taxed at a lower rate. This kind of move particularly suits pharmaceutical companies because they tend to be cash-rich and generate a significant amount of their revenues overseas.</p><p>George, who has been against inversions, said this one is different. “They are not doing it for tax savings.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/PFE\" target=\"_blank\">Pfizer</a>&nbsp;is looking to cut its tax,” he said, noting that the tax rate for Medtronic and Covidien is already below the U.K.’s 21 percent. “There is not tax-rate savings.”</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/PFE\" target=\"_blank\">Pfizer</a><p>Pfizer had been pursuing U.K. drug-maker&nbsp;<a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/AZN-GB\" target=\"_blank\">AstraZeneca</a>&nbsp;before deciding to abandon its bid because of opposition. But that $116 billion offer raised eyebrows on Capitol Hill, spurring U.S. lawmakers to talk about how to close the tax inversion loophole.</p><a href=\"http://data.cnbc.com/quotes/AZN-GB\" target=\"_blank\">AstraZeneca</a><p>Medtronic was careful to stress its commitments to research and development in the U.S. as part of the deal, and pledged to spend a further $10 billion in the country over the next decade.</p><p>“The medical technology industry is critical to the U.S. economy, and we will continue to invest and innovate and create well-paying jobs,” Ishrak said.</p><p>Medtronic was advised by Perella Weinberg, while Covidien was advised by Goldman Sachs.</p>"

This values the company at $93.22 per share, a 29% premium compared to Friday’s closing levels. Shareholders of Covidien will hold some 30% of the outstanding shares of Medtronic following the deal closure.</p><p>The board of directors of both companies have already approved the deal which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of this year, or in the first quarter of 2015.</p><p><strong>Strategic Rationale</strong></p><strong>Strategic Rationale</strong><p>The new combination will even have a more comprehensive product portfolio, reach and opportunities to grow. The pro-forma business employs some 87,000 employees in some 150 countries.</p><p>Underlying the deal rationale are three fundamental reasons. Medtronic will gain many more innovative capabilities given the impressive portfolio of leading products in Covidien’s pipeline.</p><p>The strong foreign exposure, even into emerging markets, brings a lot of global reach thanks to Covidien’s operations. And finally are the revenue and cost synergies, allowing the new combination to package therapies and solutions throughout the healthcare system.</p><p><strong>Financial Implications</strong></p><strong>Financial Implications</strong><p>The deal includes the famous “inversion” with regards to Medtronic’s tax structure, which results in Medtronic becoming domiciled in Ireland for obvious tax reasons. The company’s real operational headquarter remains in Minneapolis were Medtronic is currently employing 8,000 workers.</p><p>Medtronic estimates that the deal is accretive to cash earnings by 2016, the first full fiscal year after the anticipated closure of the deal. The transaction is seen accretive to GAAP earnings by 2018. By that year, the deal should result in $850 million in pre-tax cost synergies. Note that this estimate excludes any revenue synergies which are likely to be achieved.</p><p><strong>Pro-Forma Calculations</strong></p><strong>Pro-Forma Calculations</strong><p>For the fiscal year ending on April of 2014, Medtronic posted revenues of $17.0 billion, which up 2.5% on the year before. The company posted an 11.6% drop in earnings to $3.06 billion.</p><p>Medtronic held a strong balance sheet with $14.2 billion in cash and $11.9 billion in debt, resulting in a modest net cash position of $2.3 billion. The cash component of the deal calls for $15.9 billion in cash being transferred to Covidien’s shareholders. This most likely requires still a significant bridge financing or credit line to be arranged despite the large cash balances.</p><p>Given that Covidien holds $1.2 billion in cash and $5.0 billion in debt, the pro-forma business will operate with roughly $17 billion in net debt. The company posted revenues of $10.2 billion for its most recent fiscal year, which is up 3.9% on the year before. Earnings fell by 10.8% to $1.70 billion.</p><p>The number of outstanding shares of Medtronic will increase from roughly 1.00 billion to 1.43 billion shares following closure of the deal based on these terms. Based on Friday’s closing price, Medtronic’s equity will be valued around $87 billion. However shares of Medtronic have risen to $66 in early trading on Monday, boosting the valuation to $94 billion.</p><p>The new pro-forma combination will have revenues of around $27 billion and post earnings of close to $4.8 billion. This values the new pro-forma equity at 3.4 times annual revenues and 19-20 times annual earnings. The company anticipates $850 million in pre-tax synergies, or roughly $743 million after tax. This increases earnings towards $5.5 billion, valuing the business at 17 times pro-forma earnings on the back of the anticipated synergies.</p><p>Note that potential tax savings might be minimal. Covidien paid an effective tax rate of 16.2% over its past fiscal year, while Medtronic had an effective tax rate of 17.3% last year. This is barely above the statutory tax rates of 12.5% for Irish-based companies.</p><p><strong>Continued Commitment To The US</strong></p><strong>Continued Commitment To The US</strong><p>The move by Medtronic to “move” into Ireland might be politically sensitive, something which the company appears to realize as it attached a dedicated segment in the press release “demonstrating the commitment to the US.”</p><p>Medtronic believes medical devices are among the US’s most valuable exports and it stresses the commitment to R&amp;D within the country.</p><p>The company will commit $10 billion in technology investments in the coming decade in areas like early stage venture capital, R&amp;D and acquisitions in the US on top of its existing plans.</p><p><strong>Takeaway For Investors</strong></p><strong>Takeaway For Investors</strong><p>The $93.22 offer implies a roughly $9.5 billion dollar premium which Medtronic is offering for Covidien, little over 11 times anticipated annual pre-tax synergies. Given the run-up in Medtronic’s shares in early trading, this premium has increased a bit more.</p><p>Note that the deal allows Medtronic to use its overseas cash without repatriating it, thereby avoiding billions in taxes to be paid if it wished to bring the cash home.</p><p>The new giant is also a more formidable competitor for&nbsp;Johnson &amp; Johnson (<a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/jnj\" target=\"_blank\">JNJ</a>)&nbsp;and to the healthcare system at large. As hospitals and medical centers are concentrating their purchases, being a more formidable supplier in the area is key in terms of product offerings as well as pricing power.</p><a href=\"http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/jnj\" target=\"_blank\">JNJ</a><p>Medtronic will gain expertise beyond its current offerings like heart devices, spinal implants and insulin pumps to new areas like weight-loss surgery.</p><p>The rationale for the deal is expected to be driven by real cost synergies as anticipated tax synergies will be very limited despite the inversion move. The $850 million in pre-tax synergies are huge in absolute terms but don’t forget that Medtronic is offering nearly a ten billion dollar premium to get its hands on Covidien. Shareholders in Covidien will furthermore hold nearly a third of the equity in Medtronic, being able to participate in the expected synergies.</p><p>The success of the deal will largely depend on anticipated revenue synergies which are not specified and hard to estimate. Note that Medtronic paid a $9.5 billion premium for Covidien based on Friday’s prices and that its own shares trade some 9% higher in pre-market trading, thereby adding another $7.5 billion in equity value. As such an incremental $17 billion in value for Medtronic seems a bit steep based on the facts as outlined currently.</p><p>Therefore I am not convinced about the deal rationale for the moment, and will hold off making an investment on the back of the deal unless more gets announced regarding the size of potential revenue synergies.</p>"

The transaction will add to Medtronic’s cash earnings during the first full year of operations for the united company.</p><p>Covidien’s Chief Executive Officer Jose Almeida, meanwhile, will remain with the company until the deal closes.

      "<p>Put yourself in Mary Barra’s shoes: After 33 years with the company, you have been CEO of General Motors (GM) for just two weeks – the first operating executive in 30 years to be CEO and the first female. You are determined to transform the moribund GM culture that led the company into bankruptcy by focusing on superior vehicles that meet your customers’ needs with design, quality, and most of all, safety.</p><p>Then you learn that the company has a major safety problem with ignition switches on the Chevrolet Cobalt that has caused 12 deaths, and you must recall 1.6 million vehicles. Your investigation uncovers that GM employees have known about this for 12 years but the problem was never surfaced – all to save $1 per car.</p><p>You recognize immediately the potential consequences: angry customers, negative publicity, and an array of liability suits, Congressional investigations, and significant financial impact. You recall how Toyota’s quality problems impacted its reputation and cost the company more than $1 billion.</p><p>You know there is likely much more looming below the surface. Amid this uncertainty you are determined to be open and honest with your customers and the general public, yet you don’t have all the facts. How can you go public without complete answers and solutions?</p><p>The pre-bankruptcy GM often had similar problems but its leaders refused to face reality. Mary Barra is a very different kind of CEO: she is determined to lead GM into a new era that focuses on customers first and sets new standards of transparency in providing the safest, highest quality vehicles. I had the privilege of getting to know her last summer when she attended my Harvard Business School course, “Leading Global Businesses” while she was GM’s chief of worldwide product development.</p><p>Thus far, Barra has performed remarkably well under the mounting pressure. She has stepped forward and acknowledged the problems, and taken full responsibility for them. Unlike the old GM, she isn’t hiding behind lawyers and PR specialists. Rather, she has spoken directly to GM’s customers and apologized for what has happened, expressing empathy by admitting that “something went very wrong … and terrible things happened.”</p><p>When Congressional hearings begin on April 1, Barra isn’t sending a subordinate: she will testify herself. She has promised to release findings of an internal investigation examining the problem’s root causes and why no action was taken. “Our overriding goal is to be transparent,” Barra said.</p><p>Barra is using this crisis to transform the old GM culture. In early March, she wrote to employees: “Our company’s reputation won’t be determined by the recall itself, but by how we address the problem going forward … What is important is taking great care of our customers and showing that it really is a new day at GM.”</p><p>To signal her determination to change GM’s culture, she appointed a new chief of global vehicle safety. She has assigned 50 employees to GM’s technical center to handle customer inquiries about safety and is holding daily meetings to oversee the recall. Using decades of experience in designing GM’s vehicles, she is focusing on understanding <em>how</em> the defect occurred and <em>why</em> it took over a decade to bring it to the public’s attention.</p><em>how</em><em>why</em><p>With so many problems like GM’s surfacing in the past decade, the American public has lost trust and confidence in the integrity and transparency of corporate leaders. In the automobile industry alone, the public still has raw memories of Ford’s Jacques Nasser blaming Firestone tires for the rollovers of Ford Explorers that caused 273 deaths, and denials of Toyota and Audi about problems with their vehicles.</p><p>It takes a long time to regain consumer confidence. By being open and transparent about GM’s problems, Barra has aligned herself with her customers and ameliorated public outrage. Acknowledging there is no quick-fix for these problems, Barra said “We have apologized, but that is only one step in the journey to resolve this … We have much more work ahead of us.” To reinforce her commitment, she announced the recall of 1.7 million newer GM vehicles suspected of carrying faulty airbags.</p><p>Barra recognizes regaining the trust of GM’s customers is far more important than the billions of dollars in lawsuits and fines that GM may incur. She weathered decades of “financial engineers” in the CEO’s chair who focused on short-term profit instead of building great products. She has been at GM long enough to know how difficult it will be to change GM’s entrenched culture. To change GM’s culture from its inward-looking, short-term focus, she has to be the role model for all employees of how to treat customers, especially during a crisis.</p><p>Mary Barra recognizes that “a burning platform” like this one offers a golden opportunity to convert GM’s culture permanently into a passionate focus on vehicles that make customers’ transportation safer and more enjoyable. Demonstrating her visionary approach to leading GM, Barra says, “We will be better because of this tragic situation, if we seize the opportunity.”</p><p>She has the leadership, wisdom, and commitment to do just that.</p><div></div>"

These are the qualities of the mindful leaders I have worked with, taught, mentored, and interviewed. They are also the qualities that give today’s best leaders the resilience to cope with the many challenges coming their way and the resolve to sustain long-term success. The real point of leverage — which though it sounds simple, many executives never discover — is the ability to think clearly and to focus on the most important opportunities.</p><p>In his new book&nbsp;<em>Focus</em>, psychologist Dr. Daniel Goleman, the father of emotional intelligence (or EQ), provides data that supports the importance of mindfulness in focusing the mind’s cognitive abilities, linking them to qualities of the heart like compassion and courage. Dr. Goleman prescribes a framework for success that enables leaders to build clarity about where to direct their attention and that of their organizations by focusing on themselves, others, and the external world — in that order. &nbsp;Cultivating this type of focus requires establishing regular practices that allow your brain to fully relax and let go of the anxiousness, confusion, and pressures that can fill the day.

(In spite of this, I still do mindless things like leaving my laptop on an airplane, but I continue to work on staying in the present moment.) All of our family members meditate regularly. Our son Jeff, a successful executive in his own right, believes he would not be successful in his high-stress job were it not for daily meditation and jogging.</p><p>Meditation is not the only way to be a mindful leader. In the classes I teach at Harvard Business School, participating executives share a wide range of practices they use to calm their minds and gain clarity in their thinking. They report that the biggest derailer of their leadership is not lack of IQ or intensity, but the challenges they face in staying focused and healthy. To be equipped for the rapid-fire intensity of executive life, they cultivate daily practices that allow them to regularly renew their minds, bodies, and spirits. Among these are prayer, journaling, jogging and/or physical workouts, long walks, and in-depth discussions with their spouses and mentors.</p><p>The important thing is to have a regular introspective practice that takes you away from your daily routines and enables you to reflect on your work and your life — to really focus on what is truly important to you. By doing so, you will not only be more successful, you will be happier and more fulfilled in the long run.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel and his leadership team are experiencing every company’s worst nightmare. This problem is as bad as it can get. As a retailer, the loss of private customer data hurts consumer trust. The timing of the crisis—the biggest shopping month of the year—was doubly unfortunate.</p><p align=\"left\">Yet, in response, Steinhafel and his team seem to be doing everything right. Steinhafel is wise enough to know that the most important thing here is Target’s ability to maintain the confidence of its customers. Every decision he has made since the crisis began is based on that clear objective.&nbsp; Steinhafel and his colleagues have been fully transparent with their “guests,” as they refer to customers. They have offered to reimburse them for any losses incurred. They have not only reissued their Target credit cards, but any other credit cards used in their stores, and paid for the cost of reissuing them.</p><p align=\"left\">The good news here, if there is any, is that the actual losses incurred by Target customers pale in comparison to the enormous number of accounts breeched. In part, this is because Target moved so quickly to cancel and reissue credit cards.</p><p align=\"left\">Steinhafel seems to be following the well-known playbook of the 1982 Tylenol crisis, when CEO Jim Burke distinguished himself with his openness, authenticity, and transparency. At the time, many so-called experts predicted that Tylenol could never recover. As a result of Burke’s aggressive actions to protect consumers, Tylenol quickly regained its leading position in the consumer market.</p><p align=\"left\">Some pundits have criticized Target for additional revelations that expanded the number of customers who may have been impacted. If you understand even a little about cyber-security, you know that you often don’t have all the information initially. Firms like British Petroleum have tried to buy time by withholding information until they knew the full story. This only made the situation worse and caused them to lose control over the public messages.</p><p align=\"left\">Target has gone in the opposite direction, providing all the information it had at its disposal as quickly as possible. The problem is that you don’t know what you don’t know. As its team of experts dug deeper into its computer files, Target learned additional information that it immediately shared with its customers and the media. Since the crisis broke, transparency has been the company’s motto.</p><p align=\"left\">In 2009 shortly after the peak of the global financial crisis, I wrote the book <em>7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis</em>, which provides a framework for handling this type of urgent, important, highly visible situation.&nbsp; I’ll use it to check in against how Steinhafel’s actions follow it:</p><em>7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis</em><p align=\"left\">\n</p><ul>\n<li><em>Lesson #1: &nbsp;Face Reality:</em> Steinhafel immediately recognized the potential impact of the data theft on its customers and did everything within its power to inform them and protect them from further harm. While this hurt Target’s pre-Christmas sales, it may have salvaged trust &nbsp;with its customers.</li>\n<li><em>Lesson #2: &nbsp;Use Your Teammates:</em> Steinhafel has formed a strong working team of his top executives, his board, and external advisors—they are working actively and diligently together.</li>\n<li><em>Lesson #3: &nbsp;Dig Deep for the Root Cause:</em> Supported by outside experts, Target’s information technology team has continued to dig deeper into its computer files, enabling it to get to the root cause of the problem. They still have not figured out who invaded their systems.&nbsp; (And they may not; the terrorist who laced Tylenol capsules with cyanide was never identified.)</li>\n<li><em>Lesson #4: &nbsp;Get Ready for the Long Haul: </em>Target’s leadership has recognized that this crisis won’t go away easily, so it has focused on restoring the confidence of its shoppers as well as the general public.</li>\n<li><em>Lesson #5: &nbsp;Never Waste a Good Crisis:</em> Steinhafel recognizes that he can use this crisis to strengthen his ties to Target’s guests by being open and offering to reimburse them, whatever the cost.</li>\n<li><em>Lesson #6: &nbsp;You’re in the Spotlight: Follow True North: </em>Throughout the crisis Steinhafel has maintained his integrity and his openness. He has been visible to his customers, including his appearance on CNBC on Monday, January 13.</li>\n<li><em>Lesson #7: &nbsp;Go on Offense, Focus on Winning Now:</em> It’s too soon in the crisis to think about winning in the marketplace, as Target is currently trying to hold its position with customers after the December shortfall. Looking ahead, I have no doubt that Target management will attempt to turn its handling of this crisis into expanding its business with its customers.<em>&nbsp;</em></li>\n</ul><li><em>Lesson #1: &nbsp;Face Reality:</em> Steinhafel immediately recognized the potential impact of the data theft on its customers and did everything within its power to inform them and protect them from further harm.

Between 1995 and 2005, I served on the Target board when he was Executive Vice President, Merchandising and later President. He has also been a participant in the courses we run at Harvard Business School for new CEOs. He is a person of absolute integrity. I have never seen him prevaricate or dissemble, even under extreme pressure. For him, everything revolves around satisfying his guests. He is a brilliant merchant, arguably the finest in the retail field. He can anticipate customer needs and fulfill them.</p><p align=\"left\">This isn’t the first crisis Steinhafel has faced as CEO. Shortly after taking over the reins from former CEO Bob Ulrich, he faced an aggressive attack from activist hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who wanted to break up the actual company.&nbsp; Ackman’s plan proposed spinning off Target’s credit cards and its real estate holdings—destroying the company’s integrated strategy of retail merchandising, credit cards that offered customers the opportunity to contribute 1% of their Target expenditures to their favorite K-12 school, and real estate tailored to its merchandising strategy. Target management and its board rejected Ackman’s demands and won a proxy fight with 80% of shareholder votes cast.</p><p align=\"left\">As an executive, you would never wish for a major crisis, but as I have learned in crises at Medtronic, Goldman Sachs and Exxon, they can make your company more effective and your organization more unified and committed to its True North in the long-run. Ultimately, I predict the same thing will happen at Target.</p><div></div>"

      "<p align=\"left\">As 2014 approaches, many of us are looking for ways to live more mindfully. Many of us want to be more mindful, but few of us know how. Below I have compiled a sampling of eight exceptional books on mindful living that will help you become a better leader and a more fulfilled human being.</p><p align=\"left\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Focus</span> by Dan Goleman</strong><strong>:</strong> The breakthrough book of 2013. Goleman writes from his vast experience and understanding of the mind about living more mindfully to focus your life and your work on what is truly important in your life. After a treatise on neuroscience discoveries of how the brain can be remodeled through meditation and other calming techniques, Goleman brings great clarity to the subject at hand: finding inner focus (focus on self), focus on others, and focus on the world around you. If you adopt his approaches, your life will not only be more productive, it will be more fulfilling. For $27.95 minus the amazon.com discount, that’s a bargain.</p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Focus</span> by Dan Goleman</strong><span>Focus</span><strong>:</strong><p align=\"left\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Why Meditate?</span> by Matthieu Ricard: </strong>As a molecular geneticist turned Buddhist monk, Matthieu Ricard is one of the world’s leading experts on meditation. As the Dalai Lama’s scientific advisor, he has been a pioneer in demonstrating scientifically the benefits of meditation in calming and focusing the mind. A frequent lecturer and panelist on mindfulness, he has helped open up meditation to non-Buddhists.

Leaders of both genders can learn a great deal about how to be successful in the workplace from Facebook COO Sandburg’s wisdom, candor and experience. Sandburg’s advice to be deeply engaged, passionate, and committed applies to all of us. She has deep thoughts on how we can all contribute more in the workplace, inspire those around us, and thus be more effective as leaders. She shares many personal stories. In so doing, she comes across as a humble leader who has gained much from her mistakes and learned from her challenges.</p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Lean In</span> by Sheryl Sandburg:</strong><span>Lean In</span><p align=\"left\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Wonder Women</span> by Deborah Spar:</strong>&nbsp;If you resonate with “Lean In,” then you’ll like “Wonder Women” even more. Spar, who is president of Barnard College, is a former HBS colleague of mine whom I with on the board of Goldman Sachs. She is a superb writer, whose writing is deeply authentic and candid. She is genuinely honest about the challenges she and many other women face in trying to juggle their careers, marriages, mothering, and roles in the community. She acknowledges the barriers but also the self-imposed limitations many women create. You will come away inspired to open the doors and bring more women into the upper echelons of all organizations.</p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Wonder Women</span> by Deborah Spar:</strong><span>Wonder Women</span><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Becoming a Genuine Leader</span> by Marilyn Mason:</strong> Mason delves deeply into the impact of one’s family of origin to discover the secrets required to become a genuine leader. As author Gail Sheehy writes on the cover, “She takes you home again, to discover how you learned to negotiate in the first organization to which you belonged, your family. Her psychological insights are stunning.&nbsp; She illuminates the passage to authentic leadership.” (For the record, I consider that authentic leadership and genuine leadership are synonymous.) Mason has a deep understanding of family systems and how we carry the rules and the wounds from our families of origin into our families of choice and even find our families at work. In better understanding the families we grew up in, we can build better relations in our own families and in our chosen place of work.</p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Becoming a Genuine Leader</span> by Marilyn Mason:</strong><span>Becoming a Genuine Leader</span><p align=\"left\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Finding the Space to Lead</span>, by Janice Marturano:</strong> Marturano is the former associate general counsel of General Mills. She began her work in mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) by attending one of guru Jon Kabat-Zinn’s programs. Then she began teaching classes in MBSR at General Mills. Eventually, she morphed her work into mindful leadership and began running weekend seminars on that subject for executives. They were so popular that she had the courage to run these seminars as a full-time business. Her book provides a very practical guide to meditation (I prefer calling it by its real name rather than the “safe” euphemism MBSR) with numerous exercises that help the reader become more mindful and, thus, a better leader.</p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Finding the Space to Lead</span>, by Janice Marturano:</strong><span>Finding the Space to Lead</span><p align=\"left\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Daring Greatly</span>, by Brene Brown: </strong>You may be acquainted with Brown from her exceptional TED talk, but her book takes you much deeper into how your willingness to be vulnerable can transform your leadership and your life. As she says, being vulnerable takes courage and the willingness to look deep inside yourself, confront your demons and your shame, and emerge a whole person. When you try to hide your vulnerabilities, others sense your weaknesses and they have the power. When you share them openly, then you have the power.</p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Daring Greatly</span>, by Brene Brown: </strong><span>Daring Greatly</span><p align=\"left\"><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Conscious Capitalism</span> by John Mackey and Raj Sisodia: </strong>Mackey, the founder and co-CEO of Whole Foods, teams with Sisodia to write the finest treatise of my adult lifetime on what genuine capitalism is all about. As I said in the Foreword that Mackey asked me to contribute, “This is the book that I wish I had written.” I said that because I believe that the authors have discovered how to build and sustain a successful enterprise. Their ideal company is driven by purpose and values, provides unique value for customers, inspires employees to peak performance, serves society and communities simultaneously, and ultimately creates lasting value for shareholders. They avoid the common trap of responding to short-term shareholders by staying focused on Whole Foods’ mission and greater purpose. Mackey’s idealism is truly inspiring – and he has backed it up by demonstrating conclusively that his approach creates superior results for the long term – not just for Whole Foods, but for many other companies as well.</p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Conscious Capitalism</span> by John Mackey and Raj Sisodia: </strong><span>Conscious Capitalism</span><div></div>"

    "post_link": "https://www.billgeorge.org/articles/is-obama-backing-away-from-obamacare/",
    "post_date": "December 21, 2013",
    "post_content": [
      "<p>The latest announcement from the White House on Thursday, December 19, seems to indicate that even President Obama is backing away from Obamacare.</p><p align=\"left\">At the very least, he is bobbing and weaving like an exhausted prize fighter trying to avoid a knockout punch. For the President, that punch would be a disastrous rollout of Obamacare that leaves Americans so angry that the Democrats lose their five-seat majority in the Senate in 2014. That could happen with the never-ending fallout from the new plans. Not surprisingly, the latest White House retreat just before the December 23<sup>rd</sup> enrollment deadline was triggered by pressure from moderate Senate Democrats like Mark Warner (D-VA) and Mary Landrieu (D-LA).&nbsp; Landrieu faces a tough 2014 election campaign.</p><sup>rd</sup><p align=\"left\">Thursday’s announcement said that six million Americans who have had their insurance plans cancelled are eligible to buy catastrophic policies and are exempt from penalties if they go without insurance in 2014. Not that the new catastrophic plans are cheap. In California the pre-Obamacare median cost for a 25-year old non-smoking male was $92 per month on eHealthInsurance.com. This compares to $205 per month for a bronze plan and $184 per month for a catastrophic plan. Tacitly admitting that for many Americans the cost of buying insurance on the federal exchange <em>exceeds</em> their current insurance cost, Health and Human Services Secretary Katherine Sebelius offered them the opportunity to apply for a “hardship exemption.”</p><em>exceeds</em><p align=\"left\">This is the fourth major pullback by the White House from the Affordable Care Act. In July the employer mandate to provide health care to all their employees was delayed one year until January 1, 2015. That followed the prior year’s scrapping of long-term insurance plans which were deemed too expensive. Then in November President Obama, facing massive criticism for not upholding his promise that all Americans could keep their insurance plans, told insurers to reinstate the cancelled plans, provided their state insurance commissioners agreed. (Several did not.) On November 27, the White House withdrew the opportunity for small businesses to buy insurance on federal exchanges in 2014.</p><p align=\"left\">All these changes are causing mass confusion and consternation for the insurers. Already, two of the four largest insurers – United Health and Cigna – have elected not to participate in the exchange, a decision that appears fortuitous. The remaining participants in the federal exchange are preparing for massive adverse selection that raises their costs far beyond the projections they used in bidding on these plans, especially the bronze plans. As the healthy young opt to go without insurance and pay the modest penalty or take the catastrophic plans, the insurers are left with the least healthy people in their plans. The latter comprise the vast majority of people enrolled to date.</p><p align=\"left\">All these changes are exposing the flawed premise on which Obamacare is based: that the healthy young are willing to pay much more for insurance in order to support the unhealthy elderly. This policy marks the first time in U.S. history that we are asking the young to pay for the old; historically, it has always been the other way around. Altruism would not have motivated the young to assume this new cost, so the Democrats used the mandate to force the young into the pools—subsidizing care of the elderly at much higher costs to themselves. The mandate eked through the U.S. Supreme Court on a 5-4 decision, thanks to the tortured logic of Chief Justice John Roberts who deemed it wasn’t mandate after all, but rather a tax. All this comes at a time when youth unemployment is still in double digits and many more young people are stuck in low-paying jobs that barely enable them to make ends meet.</p><p align=\"left\">To compound the problem, the law has a key provision that <em>no one can be asked to pay more because they are in ill health.</em> The converse of that clause is that insurers cannot offer incentives to people for remaining in good health through diet, exercise, stress reduction, and limiting consumption of cigarettes, alcohol and drugs. That forms a sharp contrast with self-insured employers who are racing to offer employees massive incentives for staying healthy. These employers understand the reality that Washington seems to deny: health care costs can only come down when people start taking responsibility to live healthier lives. Pragmatic employers who bear the cost of their employees’ health care, know that lifestyle accounts for more than 50% of total health care costs.&nbsp; Therefore, they offer incentives to improve employees’ lifestyles.</p><em>no one can be asked to pay more because they are in ill health.</em><p align=\"left\">The impact of this provision will become highly visible in early 2014 when insurers announce increased prices for their 2015 plans. That will trigger another round of consumer reactions, and responses from the Obama administration shortly before the November 2014 mid-term elections. Will the administration extend opportunities for people to go without coverage or shift to catastrophic plans? Or will the administration try to offset the rising costs by further reducing reimbursement to hospitals and physicians for Medicare and Medicaid? If the latter, we are likely to see a stampede of providers that refuse to take new Medicare/Medicaid patients, even those within five years of becoming eligible.</p><p align=\"left\">Given this looming disaster, I support the Obama administration’s “go slow” approach, and offering the option of catastrophic plans for all Americans. This is something I argued for unsuccessfully back in 2009-2010 before the law was enacted. To make Obamacare viable, however, two further changes will be required: 1) reducing the minimum requirements in the plans to enable people to select plans tailored to their needs, and 2) permitting insurers to offer incentives to their enrollees for staying healthy. The consequence of these two actions will be that unhealthy Americans will have to pay more, regardless of their age, and the healthy will not be required by law to subsidize the unhealthy. These changes are certain to raise the hackles of liberal Democrats, but they are the only to avoid the looming disaster in rapidly rising health care costs that could bankrupt Medicare/Medicaid.</p><p align=\"left\">In early 2014 the President will be faced with a stark choice, as the shortfall of healthy Americans signing up through healthcare.gov becomes reality, and the consequences of adverse selection cause insurers to reprice their 2015 plans. He can cling to the original liberal provisions of Obamacare and face massive political fallout. Or he can take a more gradual approach to universal health care that provides people with incentives to stay healthy. For the sake of our country, I hope he chooses the latter option.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>FIFA, the governing world body of soccer led by long-time mogul Sepp Blatter, loves controversy, chance and corruption. No doubt this generates lots of media attention–but it certainly does not instill a sense of equity in its decision-making.</p><p align=\"left\">How else could the world’s #2 team, Germany, be paired with #5 Portugal, #14 USA, and #24 Ghana?&nbsp; All of these teams advanced to the next round in 2010! &nbsp;Meanwhile the “Group of Death” has #3 Argentina’s group and also contains #45 Iran, #36 Nigeria, and #22 Bosnia. (Eat your heart out, Jurgen Klinsmann.)</p><p align=\"left\">FIFA’s latest manufactured controversy stems from its arcane method of placing the teams of 32 nations in eight brackets. Essentially, FIFA assigned each qualifying World Cup team into one of four pots. On Friday, balls corresponding to the teams were literally placed into four “pots” (actually bowls) and then teams were selected (at random) from the pots in a drawing. As each team’s ball was selected from the pot, it was placed into an A-H grouping for the First Round. What a mess!</p><p align=\"left\">This is certainly not a difficult task by modern sporting standards. The world’s leading tennis tournaments figured this out decades ago. The NCAA basketball tournaments use a similar approach for both the men’s and women’s brackets.</p><p align=\"left\">How to do it? Just take the most recent FIFA rankings – that’s November 28, 2013, after all the World Cup qualifying games were completed – for each country’s team and place it in brackets from one to 32, eliminating higher-ranked teams that didn’t qualify.

Granted, the US would have to beat Mexico and Cameroon to advance, assuming #3 Argentina dominates this group. But that’s better than having to beat both #5 Portugal and #24 Ghana. And #11 Belgium couldn’t coast into the next round in a soft group like it has with Russia, Algeria, and South Korea.</p><p align=\"left\">By adopting this system, FIFA could restore an even playing field to the World Cup competition.&nbsp; As it stands now, much of the competition will be determined by the luck-of-the-draw approach utilized to select the groupings. More importantly, teams that performed well in all competitions in the past year would be rewarded by accumulating objective points in FIFA’s ranking system.</p><div></div>"

      "<p align=\"left\">Late this evening Nelson Mandela died at the age of 95. He was the greatest leader of our lifetime. His <em>Long Walk to Freedom</em> included 27 years in prison on Robben Island, hard labor, and cruel treatment for a political crime he did not commit.</p><em>Long Walk to Freedom</em><p align=\"left\">Yet he emerged from prison on February 11, 1990, unbowed and unbroken, a proud man determined to save his nation from the civil war that had long been anticipated. His goal was to restore harmony between blacks, whites, colored and Indian.</p><p align=\"left\">That evening in Cape Town, in his first public appearance in 27 years, he began by saying:</p><p align=\"left\"><em>I stand here before you not as a prophet but as a humble servant of you, the people.<br>\n</em><em>Your tireless and heroic sacrifices have made it possible for me to be here today.<br>\n</em><em>I therefore place the remaining years of my life in your hands.</em></p><em>I stand here before you not as a prophet but as a humble servant of you, the people.<br>\n</em><br><em>Your tireless and heroic sacrifices have made it possible for me to be here today.<br>\n</em><br><em>I therefore place the remaining years of my life in your hands.</em><p>He concluded by telling the assembled masses:</p><p><em>It is only through disciplined mass action that our victory can be assured.<br>\n</em><em>We call upon our white combatants to join us in the shaping of a new South Africa.<br>\n</em><em>Our march to freedom is irreversible.<br>\n</em><em>We must not allow fear to stand in our way.<br>\n</em><em>Universal suffrage in a non-racial, democratic South Africa<br>\n</em><em>Is the only way to peace and racial harmony.<br>\n</em><em>It is an idea for which I am prepared to live for and fight for.<br>\n</em><em>If needs be, it is an idea for which I am prepared to die.</em></p><em>It is only through disciplined mass action that our victory can be assured.<br>\n</em><br><em>We call upon our white combatants to join us in the shaping of a new South Africa.<br>\n</em><br><em>Our march to freedom is irreversible.<br>\n</em><br><em>We must not allow fear to stand in our way.<br>\n</em><br><em>Universal suffrage in a non-racial, democratic South Africa<br>\n</em><br><em>Is the only way to peace and racial harmony.<br>\n</em><br><em>It is an idea for which I am prepared to live for and fight for.<br>\n</em><br><em>If needs be, it is an idea for which I am prepared to die.</em><p>Nelson Mandela indeed was able to achieve his dream and was elected president of the democratic South Africa, stepping down after five years.</p><p align=\"left\">How was this man, himself the victim of so much injustice, able to forgive his captors and work tirelessly for harmony between all the people of South Africa? He rose above his feelings of anger to recognize his greater calling to become the man of peace who could unite all his country’s people and put his country ahead of himself, his race, or his party.</p><p align=\"left\">For his vision, his passion for his cause, his compassion for his fellow people, and his courage to put his life on the line to achieve his goal, Nelson Mandela is the greatest leader of our lifetime. His life stands as a symbol of human capacity to set aside differences, ancient hatreds, and historic injustice to achieve peace and harmony.</p><p>On a personal note, although I have been to South Africa many times, I met Nelson Mandela only once, when he was in Minneapolis on a 2001 trip to raise funds for a museum at Robben Island.&nbsp; Penny and I had fifteen minutes alone with him to hear his stories from his time in prison and his vision for the future of South Africa. He was so inspired about developing a new generation of leaders in South Africa and throughout the continent of Africa that&nbsp;we decided to fund the leadership development program he had created from this purpose. In an unrelated incident, in early 1997 when our son Jon – then a junior at Amherst College – decided to spend a semester in Soweto working as an orderly at Baraguawanth Hospital, he had trouble clearing customs as he did not have a work permit. A call from Winnie Mandela, at the time Nelson’s wife, to the customs inspectors enabled him to clear customs and have a transformational experience that semester.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>Only President Obama can save Obamacare.</p><p>Obamacare is <em>not</em> going to be repealed – not now and not in the future. However, there is real risk it could collapse under its own weight. If that happens, the President’s credibility will collapse as well. Whether or not you support this President, this could seriously harm the health of our citizens and America’s fiscal stability.</p><em>not</em><p>The President will not succeed until he faces this reality: the challenge of Obamacare is not a political issue, it is a management issue. Playing politics–no matter how successfully–cannot solve management problems.</p><p>To save Obamacare, the President should:</p><p>#1: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Replace the politicians with professionals</span>. President Obama is a superb politician, but he needs to surround himself with experienced leaders who possess the capabilities he lacks. That means replacing HHS Secretary Katherine Sebelius (also a fine politician) with an experienced health care leader who has successfully created large-scale systems serving millions of people. My first recommendation is George Halvorson, who built Kaiser Permanente as its Chair and CEO. Other candidates include Dr. William Brody, MD, PhD, who currently heads the Salk Institute, and Lois Quam, who built Optum Health for UnitedHealth Group and was Hillary Clinton’s head of global health at the U.S. State Department.</p><span>Replace the politicians with professionals</span><p>#2: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fulfill the promises that “No one would lose their current health plan” and “You can keep your doctor.”</span> The promises Obama made to build public support for the law are simply not true today. Already, two million people have had their health insurance cancelled, and the number could rise as high as 16 million. The law set uniform standards for all Americans at a very high level, knocking out high deductible plans and forcing levels of coverage that many people don’t want or need. The President needs a quick fix by asking for Congressional approval to exempt all existing health plans for the next three years rather than forcing people into more expensive plans on the exchanges. Then HHS should notify participants in these plans they can keep their plans until January 1, 2017, providing adequate time to adapt to Obamacare.</p><span>Fulfill the promises that “No one would lose their current health plan” and “You can keep your doctor.”</span><p>#3: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Turn healthcare.gov into a consumer-friendly website</span>. The problem with the government exchange site is <em>not</em> a technical problem, but a management problem. Until this week, no one has been in charge of the overall system, leaving the techies working at cross purposes with each other and the federal bureaucrats trying to control them. Is anyone surprised this led to mass chaos? Worse yet, no one thought through what consumers wanted and how to make the system easy for them to navigate. Secretary Sebelius has acknowledged that HHS never did “end-to-end” testing of the system. Nor did HHS run pilot tests in any states. Can you imagine Apple not bothering to test the complete system before launching the iPad?</p><span>Turn healthcare.gov into a consumer-friendly website</span><em>not</em><p>#4: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Slow down Obamacare’s implementation</span>. After this false start, trying to force all Americans to choose a plan by January 1, 2014 is a formula for disaster. The President needs to take the pressure off by delaying the effective date of the individual mandate to July 1, 2014 or January 1, 2015. The latter is the new effective date of the employer mandate, which has already been delayed a year. Even the most skilled professionals can’t fix this system overnight, so don’t force an unrealistic timetable that causes frustration and chaos.</p><span>Slow down Obamacare’s implementation</span><p>#5: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fix the problem of adverse selection before it spirals out of control</span>. The underlying premise of Obamacare is to force high premiums on healthy young people to pay for the high cost of unhealthy older people. Early indications are that this isn’t working, as high cost patients are signing up but young people are not. Many will simply opt out by paying a modest penalty for not carrying insurance – less than $100 in year one. To correct this problem, Obamacare should be modified to permit healthy and young people to enroll in high-deductible plans. This could lead to upward rate adjustments for the older population which better reflects their share of the costs. The President won’t like this adjustment but it is inevitable, so he is better off being proactive than waiting for another crisis that could further derail Obamacare.</p><span>Fix the problem of adverse selection before it spirals out of control</span><p>#6: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Change the subject from insurance access for disease care to healthy living</span>. For the past five years all the energy has gone into providing insurance access for all Americans – a worthy goal. Little has been done to address the real driver of health care costs: the declining health of the American people. More than 50% of health care costs are lifestyle-related, yet 95% of our efforts and the reimbursement that goes with it is for downstream care. By giving everyone full access to downstream care, there is no incentive to keep yourself healthy. In fact, the Affordable Care Act specifically prohibits charging less to healthy individuals, as most employer-based plans do. The <em>only</em> sustainable way of controlling costs is to incentivize people to take responsibility to keep themselves healthy with the support of their health care team, which should include health and wellness practitioners. For its part, HHS needs to move forward with the reimbursement shift for providers from “fee for service” plans to “paying for value” delivered to its patients, an essential step in shifting the focus.</p><span>Change the subject from insurance access for disease care to healthy living</span><em>only</em><p><em>Conclusion</em></p><em>Conclusion</em><p>Our health care system urgently needs to be fixed, but in its current form Obamacare is not what the doctor ordered. Republican efforts to repeal it altogether are a distraction that only serves to divide the country. In the three and one-half years since the Affordable Care Act was passed, the President has been unable to build support among the general population, nor is HHS ready to implement it in its original form. Instead, the President should take a pragmatic approach to give a new management team time develop a viable implementation plan that gives consumers time to adapt and incentives for staying healthy.</p><div></div>"

Instead of taking on sluggish, poorly managed businesses, they want to restructure many of the world’s most profitable, best-managed companies. Their targets —&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=PEP&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">PepsiCo</a>, Apple,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=TGT&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=WFM&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Whole Foods</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=PG&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Procter &amp; Gamble</a>, Kraft and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=DELL&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Dell</a>&nbsp;— represent the gold standard of corporate governance. These companies are run by highly engaged, professional leaders. So why are activists like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/i/carl_c_icahn/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" target=\"_blank\">Carl C. Icahn</a>, William A. Ackman,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/nelson_peltz/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" target=\"_blank\">Nelson Peltz</a>&nbsp;and Ron Burkle taking aim at them?</p><a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=PEP&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">PepsiCo</a><a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=TGT&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Target</a><a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=WFM&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Whole Foods</a><a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=PG&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Procter &amp; Gamble</a><a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=DELL&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Dell</a><a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/i/carl_c_icahn/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" target=\"_blank\">Carl C. Icahn</a><a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/p/nelson_peltz/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" target=\"_blank\">Nelson Peltz</a><p>While activists often cloak their demands in the language of long-term actions, their real goal is a short-term bump in the stock price. They lobby publicly for significant structural changes, hoping to drive up the share price and book quick profits. Then they bail out, leaving corporate management to clean up the mess. Far from shaping up these companies, the activists’ pressure for financial engineering only distracts management from focusing on long-term global competitiveness.</p><p>These activists have a keen sense of timing, buying up shares when the stock is down because of near-term events. There is nothing wrong with that.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/warren_e_buffett/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Warren E. Buffett</a>&nbsp;does the same. The difference is that Mr. Buffett invests for the long term in companies like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=KO&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Coca-Cola</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=WFC&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Wells Fargo</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=IBM&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">I.B.M.</a>&nbsp;He says his ideal holding period is “forever,” and he leaves management alone to focus on results.</p><a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/warren_e_buffett/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Warren E. Buffett</a><a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=KO&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Coca-Cola</a><a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=WFC&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Wells Fargo</a><a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=IBM&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">I.B.M.</a><p>A relevant example is Mr. Peltz’s demands to restructure PepsiCo. After forcing the spinoff of Kraft’s North American business into a company called Mondelez, Mr. Peltz’s Trian Partners is left holding 3 percent of a company that cannot compete with global leaders like Nestlé and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=UN&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Unilever</a>. So Mr. Peltz wants PepsiCo to buy Mondelez and then split into two companies: beverages and snacks, including Mondelez. This financial engineering makes no sense. Rather, it demonstrates Mr. Peltz’s lack of understanding of what is required to run successful global enterprises.</p><a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=UN&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Unilever</a><p>PepsiCo’s results demonstrate the validity of the “performance with purpose” strategy of its chief executive, Indra K. Nooyi. It recently reported its sixth consecutive quarter of solid organic revenue growth as core earnings per share grew 17 percent and gross margins expanded. Its global portfolio of snacks, beverages and healthy foods has high co-purchase and co-consumption levels, generating $1 billion a year in scale benefits. Ms. Nooyi uses cash flow from traditional beverages to finance investments and growth in emerging markets, innovation and healthy brands, which now account for 20 percent of PepsiCo’s revenue. PepsiCo’s stock is up about 25 percent over the last two years, compared with 11 percent for its archrival, Coca-Cola.</p><p>Mr. Peltz is not the only activist going after healthy companies. Here are some other examples:</p><p><strong>Whole Foods</strong></p><strong>Whole Foods</strong><p>Mr. Burkle moved in on Whole Foods when its stock was at its 2009 low of $4, having fallen from $39. Whole Foods’ leadership ignored Mr. Burkle’s pressure, stayed true to its mission and strategy, merged with Wild Oats and invested in deluxe new stores while expanding sales at stores open more than a year. Today its stock is above $50 and has traded above $55.</p><p><strong>Target</strong></p><strong>Target</strong><p>In 2009, Mr. Ackman tried to pressure Target to break up its integrated portfolio of retail, real estate and credit card holdings, mimicking Eddie Lampert’s disastrous strategy at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=SHLD&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Sears</a>. Target fought back, won 80 percent of shareholder votes in a proxy fight over Mr. Ackman’s proposed board slate and focused on its long-term strategy to compete with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=WMT&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Wal-Mart Stores</a>. Since then, Target’s stock is up 64 percent.</p><a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=SHLD&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Sears</a><a href=\"http://dealbook.on.nytimes.com/public/overview?symbol=WMT&amp;inline=nyt-org\" target=\"_blank\">Wal-Mart Stores</a><p><strong>J.C. Penney</strong></p><strong>J.C. Penney</strong><p>Mr. Ackman next bought into J.C. Penney with a stake that now amounts to about 18 percent and hired Ron Johnson from Apple as chief executive. They hastily undertook a complete remake, abandoning traditional customers and losing 30 percent of revenue. When Myron E. Ullman, the former chief executive who was brought back, tried to stabilize the company, Mr. Ackman publicly attacked the board. Finally, the board forced Mr. Ackman to resign, leaving him with an estimated $500 million in losses. To his credit, Mr. Ackman is acknowledging his mistakes.</p><p><strong>Procter &amp; Gamble</strong></p><strong>Procter &amp; Gamble</strong><p>Mr. Ackman also went after venerable Procter &amp; Gamble and its chief executive, Bob McDonald, proposing questionable short-term actions to drive up the stock price. He personally attacked Mr. McDonald even as the company posted two strong quarters. Under pressure, the board decided to replace Mr. McDonald with his predecessor, A.G. Lafley. Meanwhile, P.&amp;G. continues to lose ground globally to its archrival, Unilever.</p><p><strong>Dell</strong></p><strong>Dell</strong><p><a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/michael_s_dell/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" target=\"_blank\">Michael S. Dell</a>&nbsp;proposed taking private the company he founded at a 40 percent premium so he could operate it without stock market scrutiny. Hoping to squeeze $1 to $2 more a share out of Mr. Dell, Mr. Icahn bought up Dell stock and proposed his own financial structure. Now the company is in limbo, posting declining results while the ownership struggle continues.</p><a href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/d/michael_s_dell/index.html?inline=nyt-per\" target=\"_blank\">Michael S. Dell</a><p>Chief executives are responsible for building their companies for the long term, while delivering near-term results. When economic conditions and market changes put pressure on quarterly results, it takes wise and steady leadership at the top to avoid the pitfalls of cutting investments to achieve quarterly targets.

      "<p align=\"left\">Steve Ballmer’s announcement today that he will retire as Microsoft’s CEO after 14 years at the helm highlights the challenges high technology companies have in sustaining their success. Ballmer’s tenure was marred because he permitted Microsoft’s Office and Windows businesses to dominate the company. Meanwhile, opportunities in smart phones, search, mobile applications, social media, and on-line videos were ceded to emerging companies from Google to Blackberry, Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube (now part of Google). Led by the return of Bill Gates’ old nemesis, Steve Jobs, Apple has far surpassed Microsoft in every category except PC software. Even there, Jobs was able to finesse Microsoft in creating the iPad that has contributed to the steady decline of the PC business.</p><p align=\"left\">To his credit, Ballmer invested heavily in R&amp;D – over $10 billion in the past year – but Microsoft has little to show for it. Like many of its high tech counterparts – Hewlett-Packard, Yahoo, Nokia, Dell, Blackberry, Kodak and Motorola, to name a few – Microsoft has been unable to overcome the dominance of its core business. Thus, it is following a similar path to IBM with mainframe computers in the 1980s. Most likely the crowning blow for Microsoft’s founder-dominated board was the fiasco with Windows 8, its mainstream product update.</p><p align=\"left\">Microsoft’s problem is <em>not </em>a technology problem but an organizational one. It is the classic issue addressed by my HBS colleague Clay Christensen in <em>The Innovator’s Dilemma.</em> The dominant business that generates most of the profits gets the bulk of the resources and attracts the best people in the company. Meanwhile, the dominant group squeezes resources for emerging businesses, especially when funds are tight, and focuses its R&amp;D on replacement products, not true innovation. Similar things happened in the pharmaceutical industry which, with the exception of Novartis and J&amp;J, missed the biotech, med tech, and generic revolutions.</p><em>not </em><em>The Innovator’s Dilemma.</em><p align=\"left\">We had a similar problem at Medtronic with the dominance of our cardiac rhythm business, made up of pacemakers and defibrillators, which used to account for 80% of revenues and 90% of profits. Seeing the eventual saturation of that market, we used its cash flow to spend heavily to build a series of medical technology businesses through internal ventures and acquisitions. These include neurological disease, spinal disease, cardiovascular disease and diabetes, along with emerging businesses in otolaryngology and urology. Today the latter businesses account for more than 60% of Medtronic’s revenues and make up the bulk of its growth.</p><p align=\"left\">Ballmer contributed to Microsoft’s innovation problem by personally dominating its organization, not letting anyone have sufficient authority to counteract the power of the mainstream business. The consequence is that after 14 years – which is four years too long for a high tech CEO to be at the helm – Ballmer is leaving Microsoft with no successor in sight. Shame on the Microsoft board for letting this happen.</p><p align=\"left\">So the company is turning to Heidrick and Struggles to propose a successor. Let’s hope the Microsoft board is wiser in the selection process than the Hewlett-Packard board, which four times unsuccessfully went outside its ranks for a new CEO, yet never found a leader who could restore the innovative, egalitarian culture of H-P’s glory days. IBM’s approach should be a role model: it recruited Lou Gerstner, who had no computer background but was a superb strategist and leader, to get the company back on track. Gerstner wisely groomed Sam Palmisano as his successor, turning over the reins after only eight years. In the past decade Palmisano remade IBM into a highly successful enterprise systems and solutions company and groomed an internal successor, Ginny Rometty, to carry on the IBM success story.</p><p align=\"left\">Fortunately for Microsoft’s board, there are excellent candidates who could rebuild its innovative spirit.&nbsp; Three in particular come to mind: Jeff Bezos, CEO of Seattle-based Amazon; Cheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook; and John Donahoe, CEO of eBay. It is unlikely Bezos would make the shift, but Sandberg might welcome the opportunity to become CEO rather than COO. Donahoe is less well known, but has done a superb job in remaking eBay after taking over a declining franchise from former CEO Meg Whitman.</p><p align=\"left\">At this writing Microsoft’s future is very much in doubt. For the sake of America’s dominant position in the global high tech field, let’s hope its board goes the route of IBM and not H-P. Doing so will require all the wisdom of Bill Gates and his fellow board members.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>President Pribbenow, members of Augsburg College Board of Regents, and most importantly, 2013 graduates of this great institution, it is indeed a great honor and privilege for me to receive this treasured honorary degree and to have the opportunity to share with you my thoughts on your lives as servant leaders.</p><p>Augsburg is a unique place that unites and inspires all of us with its sense of learning, stewardship, and servant leadership in a diverse student body in this urban setting, underpinned by the beliefs and values of Martin Luther. This morning I would like to speak with the graduating seniors as servant leaders who can change the world.</p><p>The world you’re entering is not the more predictable one of my growing up years. Rather, it is a volatile and unpredictable place, as we learned in Boston two weeks ago during the marathon and the events that followed. It is often chaotic and ambiguous, filled with conflicting forces pulling you in multiple directions. It is an easy world in which to criticize others and bemoan all that is wrong with it, as our media does so well. But taking that path will ultimately lead you into a cul-de-sac of despair and disappointment.</p><p>How can you navigate this world to find the joy, fulfillment, and significance that we aspire to? My only truth is that each of us must seek and find our True North – our beliefs, our values, and the principles by which we lead our lives – and then strive to stay true to who we are at our core in spite of all the pressures and seductions attempting to pull us off course. This is not an easy task as the external forces in our lives attempt to influence us As Apple founder Steve Jobs once said, “Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice.”</p><p>Each of us has a unique place in this world of seven billion people – and a calling to make a difference. How will you find your calling? What truly inspires you? I believe we are all called to lead, but how? It starts with your desire to serve others through your leadership. Would-be leaders who feel people are there to serve them are not leaders at all. This means knowing yourself and engaging deeply in the world to seek and find the purpose of your leadership. It means following your heart, not just your head, with a deep sense of passion, compassion, and courage – which are all matters of the heart.</p><p>My journey to leadership was not an easy path. As the only child of older parents, I heard from my father from a young age that he wanted me to make up for his failures to lead by heading a major company. He even named the companies: Coca-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble, IBM. At age eight, this was a pretty heavy trip to lay on a little kid. In junior high and high school I joined many organizations but was never asked to lead. Finally, my senior year I ran for senior class president only to lose by a margin of 2-1. It seemed clear my classmates didn’t appreciate what a great leader I was! To get a fresh start – or perhaps try to escape myself – I went 800 miles from home to Georgia Tech and repeated my mistakes all over again – six times I ran for office and lost all six! My scorecard: 0 for 7! It was pretty clear I was more of a loser than a leader. Then some seniors took me aside and gave me some blunt feedback: “Bill, no one is ever going to want to work with you, much less be led by you, because you’re moving so fast and so focused on yourself that you don’t have time for anyone else. It’s all about you.” That was like a blow to the solar plexus. .&nbsp; . I realized they were right. After that, I worked hard to change and was successful in leading many organizations in college and grad school. But in the back of my mind was this calling to values-centered leader of a major company that served others. In my forties I was en route to the top of Honeywell when one day I looked in the mirror and saw a miserable person – me. I was in the midst of a crucible, but didn’t even realize it. Once again, I was striving so hard to get ahead that I was losing sight of my True North, focused more on becoming CEO that on serving others. That led me to make the most important career change of my life when I joined Medtronic and found a mission-driven, values-centered group of people dedicated to restoring people to full life and health. My thirteen years there were the fulfillment of my professional career, as we grew from restoring 300,000 people per year to 10 million new patients every year.</p><p>What is your calling? How will you use your unique gifts to serve others? I hope you won’t take twenty years to find it, but you might as you rub up against the real world and find your unique place. To find your calling, I encourage you to dive into the world and have as many experiences as you can in a short period of time. Don’t do what others say you “should” do, but rather what your heart calls you to do. Travel or live in countries that are completely foreign to your experience. Find a service opportunity that makes you uncomfortable because you’re learning from people whose lives are so different from you. Take risks, learn to fail and pick yourself up after failing to come back and do it better the next time. Keep a journal of your experiences and your feelings and return to it often to learn from your inner wisdom as well as the wisdom of others. Take a job doing what you love, not one that earns the most money or that your family wants you to take. Most important of all, follow your heart, not just your head.</p><p>By honoring your roots and diving into life’s experiences, you will gain a deeper awareness of who you are, your passions, your motivations, your unique strengths. When you come to a vocation or avocation that highly motivates you and you are really good at, you have found your “sweet spot” – that place where you can find joy, fulfillment, and success through serving others. And you will have found the purpose of your leadership, as I did at Medtronic, by striving to be a servant leader.</p><p>As a servant leader, you can change the world. Not the whole world of course, but the world in which you live, work, and interact with others. You can make this world a better place through your character and your leadership.&nbsp; As anthropologist Margaret Mead once said, “Never doubt the power of a small group of people to change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.” You, your classmates and your generation are the servant leaders who will make this world a better place for everyone.</p><p>When you are on your deathbed and your favorite granddaughter asks you what you did to make a difference in the world, you’ll have a clear answer for her that becomes her inspiration to go forth into this world that is filled with so much chaos, volatility, uncertainty and ambiguity – yet has so much joy, awe, and beauty all around us and the opportunity to help others find it by serving them.</p><p>Let me close with a favorite quote from Nobel Peace Prize winner Albert Schweitzer, who said: “I don’t know what your destiny will be, but one thing I do know. The only ones among you who will be really happy are those who have sought and found how to serve.”</p><p>As you journey through life, may you find that true happiness and deep sense of fulfillment by serving others through your leadership. As a servant leader, you can indeed change the world in which you live.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>Originally published in the <em><a href=\"http://m.startribune.com/business/?id=202751281&amp;c=y\">StarTribune</a></em>.</p><em><a href=\"http://m.startribune.com/business/?id=202751281&amp;c=y\">StarTribune</a></em><a href=\"http://m.startribune.com/business/?id=202751281&amp;c=y\">StarTribune</a><p>What a difference a year makes!</p><p>A year ago Best Buy was headed for the unending troubles that have beset retailers like Sears, Kmart, Circuit City, J.C. Penney and Mervyn’s: storied histories followed by long-term decline of their brands.</p><p>Last April CEO Brian Dunn resigned over allegations about a relationship with an employee. However, Best Buy’s problems went beyond Dunn’s conduct. Its same-store sales were declining and its stock price had dropped from $45 to $25. Security analysts were predicting Best Buy’s ultimate demise, referring to it as “Amazon’s showroom.”</p><p>How did Best Buy get back on track while overcoming a rupture with founder Richard Schulze? Let’s look beyond the headlines at the leaders involved.</p><p>Dunn’s resignation was just the beginning of Best Buy’s troubles. In May, Schulze stepped aside as chair for failing to disclose allegations about Dunn, and later resigned from the board, threatening to take Best Buy private. Meanwhile, interim CEO Mike Mikan was preparing a plan to preserve Best Buy by closing stores and cutting costs. This upset Schulze as he feared “his baby” would be dismantled.</p><p>Schulze countered in August with a preliminary offer of $26-$28 per share to take Best Buy private and bring in his own management team led by former Best Buy CEO Brad Anderson. Wall Street seemed skeptical whether he could raise $8 billion to $9 billion for the buyout. Meanwhile, Best Buy’s 170,000 employees, customers and shareholders wondered whether the retailer had a future.</p><p>Things changed dramatically in September when Carlson CEO Hubert Joly was elected CEO. Joly left the CEO post of Carlson to take on dual uncertainties of Best Buy’s ownership battle and unclear strategy. A brilliant strategist and astute observer, Joly recognized that Schulze would be his No. 1 shareholder whether BBY was public or private. He reached out to Schulze to engage in discussions, only to be rebuffed at first.</p><p>Joly recognized Best Buy couldn’t just cut costs or return to its past. Online retailing was here to stay and Amazon’s threat couldn’t be ignored. More important, Best Buy’s employees, customers and shareholders needed light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>With Christmas approaching, Joly announced his “Renew Blue” strategy: a balance between retail and online strategies and in-store matching of online prices. His ace in the hole Amazon couldn’t match: the Geek Squad to help customers set up their home electronics. Joly also reshaped his leadership team to fit the new strategy, replacing Dunn’s team with Shawn Score to lead retail, Scott Druckslag to spearhead online, and Sharon McCollam as CFO.</p><p>Best Buy’s shares continued to fall to a December low of $11.29, as investors didn’t believe Schulze could make a fully financed offer, nor did they think Joly could turn around Best Buy. In late December, Schulze and the Best Buy board agreed to extend his deadline for two months. Meanwhile, Joly continued to reach out to Schulze.</p><p>In January, Joly announced good news: Retail sales didn’t decline during Christmas as expected, and online sales climbed 10 percent. The bleeding was stanched, and the turnaround underway.</p><p>Meanwhile, discussions between Schulze and Best Buy continued, leading to the agreement announced March 25: Schulze became chairman emeritus as Anderson and former COO Alan Lenzmeier rejoined the board, representing Schulze’s 21 percent stake. Joly’s role as CEO was cemented. To reinforce Schulze’s newfound confidence, Joly on April 5 announced a strategic partnership with Samsung to install boutiques in Best Buy stores, giving Samsung a showroom to compete with Apple stores.</p><p>While Best Buy still has a long way to go, the road ahead is now clearer. From their December low, Best Buy shares have more than doubled to $26, so Joly can focus all of his energies on making this turnaround successful.</p><p>This outcome is far better than most anticipated. Credit Schulze for his deep commitment to Best Buy, rising above wounded pride, while letting Joly run the company. Also credit Anderson’s role as honest broker, and Best Buy’s board for hiring Joly and working toward equitable solutions. The real hero here is Joly, who recognized what was needed to turn the business around and find a way to reach an accommodation with the founder — certainly not easy tasks.</p><p>In the end there are no losers here, only winners. Enlightened leadership is transforming a great retailer and preserving this bedrock of the Twin Cities. Other companies threatened by rapid shifts to online and mobile would be well advised to learn from Best Buy’s experience.</p><div></div>"

      "<p>First-time author Steven Snyder has just published a remarkably deep and insightful book about how exceptional leaders learn from their struggles and their failures and have resilience to overcome adversity. Snyder takes many of the ideas from <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">True North</span> to a much deeper level with richer insights. He focuses on staying grounded, becoming resilient in the face of failure, making sense of a chaotic world, and illuminating your blind spots. Snyder demonstrates how you can discover your purpose and meaning through struggle and ultimately by deepening your adaptive energy in order to sustain your leadership throughout your life.</p><span>True North</span><p>I had the privilege of writing the Foreword for this book. Here are some excerpts from the Foreword:</p><p>Do your struggles make you a better leader? Is it necessary to overcome severe challenges to become an outstanding leader? Yes, emphatically, says Steven Snyder in this remarkable book. “Clearly, struggle and leadership are intertwined,” he writes. “Great leaders use failure as a wake-up call.”</p><p>That’s a conclusion many would-be leaders are reluctant to accept. In today’s world, society often searches for perfect leaders. When their actions reveal their weaknesses and shortcomings, the general public turns away from them and continues the impossible search for perfection. Media pundits, eager to condemn our leaders, pile on the criticism. Like the two tramps in playwright Samuel Beckett’s “Waiting for Godot,” who are hoping for the savior to lead them out of their misery, the public is still searching for the perfect leader. Instead of stepping up to leadership themselves, many people continue to drift through life and fail to realize their full potential as human beings and as leaders.</p><p>In <em>Leadership and the Art of Struggle</em>, Snyder takes an entirely different tack. He believes, as I do, that failure is a great teacher. To learn from it, you must be prepared to face its painful realities and use failure as a learning experience. That’s what Steve Jobs did after getting fired from the company he founded. Had he not been forced to face his own shortcomings, he never could have returned to create the success that led Apple to become the most highly valued company of all time. The same is true of Oprah Winfrey, who had to face the pain of the sexual abuse she encountered as a young girl. When she did so, she changed her message to empowering people and became the most successful media star of her era.</p><em>Leadership and the Art of Struggle</em><p>In a room filled with 125 powerful large company CEOs, I once asked Jamie Dimon, JP Morgan’s chairman and CEO, what his defining experience was. Rather than citing his great success at JP Morgan, he replied instantly, “I got fired … by my mentor of 22 years.” Learning from that experience, Dimon bounced back and become the world’s leading financial services CEO. Forced to face the reality of his bank’s $6 billion in trading losses, he took immediate responsibility. He went on “Meet the Press,” and said, “We made a terrible egregious mistake. We were stupid. There’s almost no excuse for it.”</p><p>The realities that Snyder addresses represent a fundamental building block required to develop healthy, effective leaders who are committed to building a society devoted to the well-being of all. Only in acknowledging our own flaws and vulnerabilities can we become authentic leaders who empower people to perform to the best of their abilities.</p><p>Shortly after joining the Harvard Business School faculty in 2004, I initiated a research project to determine the characteristics of authentic leaders and the ways they developed their leadership. My HBS colleagues encouraged me to discover the traits, characteristics and styles of these successful leaders. Then my HBS research associate presented me with discouraging news: 1,400 previous studies had been unsuccessful in determining these definitive characteristics, as all failed to establish statistical validity or replicability. Nevertheless, we went ahead with our project. Two skilled researchers and I interviewed 125 leaders ages 23 to 93, generating 3,000 pages of transcripts. To our disappointment, nothing definitive emerged about the leaders’ characteristics. Rather, many leaders said, “Let me just talk about what’s important to me.”</p><p>In reviewing the transcripts with our research team, I had a sickening feeling that the inputs might just turn out to be mush. But in rereading the deeply honest and personal stories these leaders told us about themselves, the conclusions literally jumped off the pages at us. It was the life stories of these leaders that shaped their leadership. Their challenging times and crucibles stoked their passion to make a difference through leading. Some of their failures – and nearly all had experienced setbacks and/or great hardships – had resulted from abandoning their roots and not staying grounded in who they were. We labeled these periods as “losing their way.” Others faced challenges not of their own making which nonetheless were life changing. Those who went on to greater success as leaders maintained fidelity to their life stories and who they were – their True North.</p><p>When we published these results in my 2007 book, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">True North</span>, they had great resonance with business and non-profit leaders – from younger managers and middle managers up to senior executives. I was especially surprised that the ideas struck a vital chord with very powerful CEOs as they were so much at variance with what was being written and taught at the time.</p><span>True North</span><p>Snyder’s book takes these same themes to a much deeper and richer level, as he pushes the limits much farther than I did.&nbsp; He asserts that struggle is an “art to be mastered,” an intrinsic aspect of leadership and an opportunity for leaders to realize their potential. That runs directly contrary to the macho image cultivated by many powerful leaders who deny their weaknesses and vulnerabilities. With that denial, they rob themselves of opportunities for deep introspection and a clearer understanding of themselves. Small wonder that many high-level leaders feel like imposters. One Stanford professor has discovered that the number one fear of top leaders is “being found out.” Thus, it is not surprising that many leaders fail, most often because they cannot face reality and deny they are at risk of causing their own failures.</p><p>Snyder takes these fundamental truths of human nature and converts them into a set of well-conceived strategies and practices that enable leaders to become grounded – a phrase that I was too timid to use in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">True North</span> in 2007 because it sounded <em>soft</em>. Of course, the real work of leaders of getting grounded in their authenticity, their humanity, and their weaknesses and vulnerabilities, as well as their strengths, is exceptionally <em>hard</em> work.</p><span>True North</span><em>soft</em><em>hard</em><p>On a personal level, it took me many years to openly acknowledge my shortcomings, weaknesses and vulnerabilities. For that reason, I wound up withholding “the real me” from colleagues at work, coming across as super-confident, aggressive, and completely focused on business results. When I began sharing my weaknesses – being impatient, lacking tact, and often coming across as intimidating – as well as the failures and difficulties I had experienced in my lifetime, I learned that people opened up about themselves and resonated more with my leadership. I accepted that I wasn’t expected to have all the answers and could more frequently admit, “I don’t know.” In being willing to be vulnerable, I found I could acknowledge the fears of being rejected as a leader that went back to high school and college when I lost seven consecutive elections because others didn’t want to work with me.</p><p>For many years I tried to deny my weaknesses and blame them on my father, as if I inherited them from him. It didn’t work. When I finally acknowledged that these were <em>my </em>weaknesses, not his, and this was who I was, I felt the burden lifting from me. Only then could I feel comfortable in being myself. These shortcomings are still part of me, but they are far less prominent, and they no longer own me as they once did. As a result, my relations with colleagues, family members and friends have steadily improved.</p><em>my </em><p>In understanding how much more people were willing to trust me after that, I recognized that “vulnerability is power,” a favorite saying of author John Hope Bryant in <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Love Leadership</span>. The paradox is that by acknowledging your vulnerabilities, you retain the power because others are unable to take advantage of you when you try to cover up your shortcomings and fears. At the same time you empower others to become more authentic by acknowledging their vulnerabilities.</p><span>Love Leadership</span><p>In teaching these ideas to senior executives, I often get puzzled looks because they have steeled themselves <em>not</em> to reveal their vulnerabilities out of fear that others might take advantage of them. Of course, the truth is precisely the opposite. In refusing to acknowledge their roles in contributing to the problems around them, many leaders repeat their mistakes rather than learning from them. They may move to another job without ever facing themselves, thinking a fresh start will obviate their difficulties.</p><em>not</em><p>As mindfulness expert Jon Kabat-Zinn writes, “Wherever you go, there you are.” In other words, we can change venue but our shortcomings are with us until we acknowledge them to ourselves as well as others. When we do so, our weaknesses steadily diminish and our strengths become more powerful. That’s also the message of the positive psychology movement initiated by Dr. Martin Seligman, which is often falsely construed as burying your past difficulties rather than growing from them.</p><p>In this book, Snyder provides specific strategies to deal with these issues. He pairs his strategies with a series of techniques and exercises that enable us to stay grounded and explore new pathways to grow from our experiences. In the end he shows us how to develop the adaptive energy required to prepare for the greater challenges we will face in leadership. Through this rigorous process, we can develop the focus and discipline to work through our issues and, ultimately, to celebrate what really matters in our lives.</p><p>Having worked with many leaders who are earnestly embarking on the journey that Snyder takes us on, my advice is not to expect instant results. Being authentically self-aware and mindful of our feelings, emotions and reactions can take many years of hard work as we peel back the layers of that unique person we are. It often takes that much time to learn how to grasp the power we have within us to be the very best we can be.</p><p>This is a journey that can be difficult if not impossible to take on your own. We all need a team of fellow pilgrims to help us on the journey as we in turn help them along their paths. As the famous Hindu philosopher J. Krishnamurti wrote, “Relationship is the mirror through which we see ourselves as we really are.” How many people do you have truly open and enduring relationships with?&nbsp; How many of them are willing to hold a mirror up to you?</p><p>We need a support team that helps us through the most challenging times of our lives. My team starts with my wife Penny, my faithful companion of 43 years, who has helped an engineer learn about psychology, human nature, and most importantly, <em>myself</em>. I have also learned a great deal from the wisdom of our two sons, Jeff and Jon, my close friends and my colleagues at Harvard Business School.</p><em>myself</em><p>Other than Penny, nothing has been more constant and helpful than my two True North Groups – my men’s group that has met weekly for 39 years and our couple’s group that has met monthly for 30 years and travelled the world together. We have learned from our personal and professional challenges and helped each other along the way, through good times and especially in difficult times. Do you have a True North Group taking this remarkable journey with you?</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Leadership and the Art of Struggle</span>&nbsp;provides you the opportunity to learn from Steven Snyder’s remarkable wisdom and the experiences of his interviewees. It is also a living guide you can return to time after time when new situations arise. You may want to undertake this journey with your support team. That will give you the opportunity to share in each other’s struggles and gain the authenticity and the mastery that characterizes wise leaders.</p><span>Leadership and the Art of Struggle</span><p>By going through this process, you will feel more alive, energized and resilient than you ever believed was possible. You will become a better and more authentic leader, your relationships will become stronger and richer, and you will be able to accomplish more.</p><p>What more could you ask for in life?</p><div></div>"

It’s never 100% one or the other, but striking that balance and getting every drop of value for the members based on their needs and expectations is one of the key the differences between a garden variety facilitator and a Vistage Chair.&nbsp; Our Chairs are what make Vistage, Vistage.</p><p>*Note:&nbsp; After spending a great deal of time with about 450 Vistage Chairs from all over the world at our International Conference in Dallas, it’s hard not to be inspired to write about the great work they do.&nbsp; I hope some of our Chairs read this post and offer their comments on this topic – a topic&nbsp;about which I can only scratch the surface without their help.</p>"

      "<p align=\"left\">Earlier this month I wrote a <a title=\"Conscious Capitalism\" href=\"http://bit.ly/Ug8dhv\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a> recommending Whole Foods founder John Mackey’s new book, <em>Conscious Capitalism</em>, as the most important book of the year, perhaps the decade. That’s why I wrote its Foreword.</p><a title=\"Conscious Capitalism\" href=\"http://bit.ly/Ug8dhv\" target=\"_blank\">blog</a><em>Conscious Capitalism</em><p align=\"left\">As the book is hitting the business best-seller lists, some people have pushed back because they think John Mackey is anti-union. Let’s take an honest look at what he actually believes:</p><p align=\"left\">\n</p><ul>\n<li>“While we believe that the best approach is to avoid the need for unions in the first place, businesses that already have labor unions should strive to engage with them constructively rather than viewing them as adversaries.” He cites Southwest Airlines as “a great example of a company that has had a predominantly positive and win-win relationship with its labor unions.” As Herb Kelleher, former CEO of Southwest Airlines, said, “I just treated them like human beings.” This is what I have always tried to practice in dealing with unionized and non-union employees.</li>\n<li>Whole Foods is a role model for treating its employees well. They are highly motivated, fairly paid with incentives, and have excellent health care and benefits. Walk into any Whole Foods store and talk to the first-line employees, as I have, and you immediately perceive they take great pride in their work and the Whole Foods mission to help people eat healthy foods.</li>\n<li>Not convinced? Then buy John’s book and read Chapter 11, page 157. There he says, “There has been a long history of adversarial relationships between companies and unions. These conflicts usually have been very harmful over the long term to all the stakeholders of the company, including unions and the team members (that is, employees) they represent. To fully flourish, companies must evolve to form win-win partnerships that create value for all stakeholders. This requires the leadership of the company and the union to both become more conscious and adopt a spirit of cooperation and partnership.”</li>\n<li>He goes on to note that unions grew 100 years ago in response to poor working conditions, saying, “There is no question that labor unions primarily came about because of the failure of businesses to care about their workers as human beings.” In my experience, management often gets the union it deserves. If it doesn’t treat its people well and pay them fairly, then employees will unionize and often engage in “win-lose” tactics to force better treatment. On the other hand, if employees are well treated and paid fairly, they do not feel the need for a third-party to represent them.</li>\n<li>Mackey observes, “private-sector union membership peaked at 36% in 1945 but has since declined to 6.9%.” My observation about this decline is <em>not </em>that employees have dropped out of unions or that companies have broken up the unions. Rather, the “win-lose” approach to collective bargaining has caused both companies and entire industries to go out of business. This pattern started with the steel industry, spread through shoes and textiles and then to airlines and automobile companies and their unionized suppliers, as well as some major retailers. Meanwhile, emerging industries, such as computers, semiconductors, IT, pharmaceuticals and medical technology, treat their employees so well that they do not feel a need for a union.</li>\n<li>Contrast this situation with Germany, where employees have “co-determination” with management and the two have pursued “win-win” solutions that benefit both sides and have enabled German companies in the chemical, automobile, auto parts, machine tools and high tech products to become world leaders in spite of the high cost of hourly labor.</li>\n<li>Mackey concludes his rationale about employees by arguing, “A conscious business knows that treating its people well is the right thing to do; it does not need to be coerced into doing so. Unions simply aren’t necessary if a business operates with a stakeholder philosophy and if team members are seen as important stakeholders who should be well compensated, happy, and flourishing in the workplace.”</li>\n</ul><li>“While we believe that the best approach is to avoid the need for unions in the first place, businesses that already have labor unions should strive to engage with them constructively rather than viewing them as adversaries.” He cites Southwest Airlines as “a great example of a company that has had a predominantly positive and win-win relationship with its labor unions.” As Herb Kelleher, former CEO of Southwest Airlines, said, “I just treated them like human beings.” This is what I have always tried to practice in dealing with unionized and non-union employees.</li><li>Whole Foods is a role model for treating its employees well.

Collectively, they describe a philosophy that is identical to the one we followed at Medtronic. The company’s bedrock philosophy is to have employees whose loyalty is to the company and the patients Medtronic serves, and who have a sense of well-being because they are well paid, fairly treated, and have “a means to share in the company’s success.”</p><div></div>"

      "<p>From:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Governance/Boards/Board_governance_depends_on_where_you_sit_3059\" target=\"_blank\">McKinsey Quarterly</a>, February 2013</p><a href=\"https://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/Governance/Boards/Board_governance_depends_on_where_you_sit_3059\" target=\"_blank\">McKinsey Quarterly</a><p><strong>Board governance</strong>&nbsp;is frequently discussed and often misunderstood. In this article, I offer an insider’s perspective on the topic. Over the years, I have had the privilege of serving on ten corporate boards, as well as being chairman and CEO of Medtronic, chairman only, and CEO only. I have also observed dozens of boards from outside the boardroom and engaged in numerous confidential conversations with members of these boards about the challenges they faced and how they handled them.</p><strong>Board governance</strong><p>What I have learned from these experiences is that one’s perspective about a board’s governance is strongly influenced by the seat one holds—independent director, chair and CEO, CEO only, or chair only. That’s why it is essential to look at corporate governance through the eyes of each of these positions.</p><p>In surveying governance through the lens of different roles, I hope to address a problem in the prevailing dialogue: many of the governance experts exerting power over boards through shareholder proposals, media articles, and legislative actions have never participated in an executive session of a major board. It’s no surprise, therefore, that their proposals deal almost entirely with formal board processes and “check the box” criteria that generally have little to do with the substance of how boards operate.</p><p>I worry, in fact, that many of these proposals could weaken the performance of boards by burdening them with an excessive amount of ministerial details. That would be a shame, because corporate boards have made progress since the scandals of recent years, with a new generation of CEOs sharing with boards more openly, listening to them more closely, and working to achieve a healthier balance of power with independent directors.</p><p><strong>Role 1: The independent director</strong></p><strong>Role 1: The independent director</strong><p>The combination of new governance regulations and rising expectations makes serving as an independent director much more important—and difficult—than it was in years past. The greatest challenge these directors face is to stay fully informed about the companies on whose boards they serve.</p><p>Information asymmetry is often at the root of this challenge. When directors are truly independent of the companies they serve, they generally lack the wealth of knowledge about the industry or business that their senior-executive counterparts have. Moreover, independent directors typically have limited engagement with the company and its board, meeting perhaps six to eight times a year. Consequently, management has far more information than independent directors can ever absorb. I recall this challenge well: of the nine boards I served on as an independent director—across a range of industries—I had industry-specific knowledge in exactly none of them.</p><p>In one instance, I recall asking why a company wanted to implement an aggressive stock-buyback program when it might be better to preserve cash to take advantage of opportunities or to use as a cushion if cash flow turned negative. My question was not well received. The CFO argued that the company had always been able to raise cash when it was needed and had never passed up an opportunity for lack of cash. A fellow director told me that I simply didn’t understand the industry and that stock buybacks were routine. So I backed off.</p><p>However, a year later the company became so concerned about volatility in financial markets that it suspended all stock buybacks and began an aggressive program of increasing its liquidity. That was a good thing, because the following year the markets completely shut down when the credit and liquidity crunch occurred. Had the firm not had a large cash reserve, it might have wound up insolvent, like many of its competitors.</p><p>Whether or not my questions a year earlier helped nudge management in this direction, I strongly believe that independent directors can provide leadership and contribute to the companies they serve in ways that go beyond meeting the basic legal requirements and fiduciary responsibilities inherent in board service. In addition to asking tough questions, three opportunities stand out.</p><p><strong>Be an advocate for sound governance</strong></p><strong>Be an advocate for sound governance</strong><p>Independent directors should be advocates—and enforcers—of sound governance principles. This is especially important in challenging times or when the company is in crisis. Too many directors accept board governance as it is, without suggesting the kinds of process improvements that would make a difference; some directors even resist them.</p><p>Yet process matters hugely in the boardroom, and not just to make sure a company abides by governance rules. Process steps help to keep board members engaged and able to fulfill their responsibilities and, more important, establish the proper balance of power between management and the board.</p><p>Perhaps the most useful aspect of the governance rules passed a decade ago in the United States is the requirement that independent directors meet in executive session without the CEO present. These sessions give directors the opportunity to share concerns about the company and to ask for improved governance steps or additional reviews. They are also a time to discuss privately any concerns that directors have about management and to ensure that directors are fully informed. Finally, the sessions are useful in building chemistry among the independent directors.</p><p>Good chemistry is important. The director of a major European company shared with me his frustration when he challenged its CEO and the direction in which the chief executive was moving the company, but received no support—just silence—from his fellow directors. Later, when the board went into executive session without the CEO in the room, the directors around the table unanimously agreed with this director, saying that the CEO was not providing the right leadership or taking the company in a sound direction.</p><p><strong>Leadership succession</strong></p><strong>Leadership succession</strong><p>Nearly all independent directors say that selecting the right leadership for a firm is their most important role. Yet in my experience, the time spent on succession is far too limited and the discussion not nearly candid enough. All too often, board members settle for a “hit by a bus” contingency plan. Such plans are crucial, of course, even if just for an interim period. Yet oftentimes the person ultimately identified to lead is just the most obvious interim leader, not the best long-term successor.</p><p>To better prepare for succession, boards should have multiple discussions each year to identify the company’s next generation of leaders. They need to create ways to get to know these candidates personally and observe them in crises and under pressure. The board should also create a series of assignments to prepare prospective CEOs and other senior-executive candidates.</p><p>If succession isn’t taken seriously, directors may find that when the time comes, they do not have confidence in the internal candidates. Faced with this situation, directors may react—or overreact—by immediately initiating an external search, which bears substantial risks of its own. Outside hires may look good on paper and have been successful elsewhere, but it is not uncommon to find they do not understand the company’s culture and values and do not take the time to identify the people who make the organization run successfully.</p><p>The board should instead conduct detailed leadership-succession-planning sessions to review candidates and their progression, ensuring that they have the necessary experiences to get them ready for the top jobs. In these reviews, the age of the potential top leaders matters. They should not be so close in age to the CEO that they would be unable to have a sufficiently long tenure as CEO prior to reaching mandatory retirement, nor can they be so young that there simply isn’t time for them to have the experiences they need for such a major task. Thus, the process of identifying candidates for top roles must start early—typically, with leaders who are barely 30 years old.</p><p>On one board on which I served, the long-time CEO, who was doing an excellent job, steadfastly resisted the board’s insistence that he develop potential successors. Frustrated by his inaction, the compensation committee (of which I was not a member) voted to provide him with a special bonus for grooming a prospective successor. He then reluctantly initiated an external search for a chief operating officer.</p><p>However, before any candidates were identified, he set up an off-site meeting with the independent directors to recommend that the external search be canceled because “it was causing too much disruption.” Instead, he proposed to the board that he would develop some much younger candidates who not only were several years away from being viable successors but also, in some cases, seemed unlikely ever to make effective CEOs.</p><p>That was enough for me. I decided to resign rather than remain part of what I viewed as a charade. The CEO stayed for many more years, eventually stepping down after two decades in the job. Even then, he continued to occupy his CEO office at company headquarters. His successor, who was quite junior to him in age, found that managers routinely took problems and opportunities to the old CEO, thereby undermining the new CEO’s authority.</p><p><strong>Leading in crisis</strong></p><strong>Leading in crisis</strong><p>The real test of a board of directors comes when the company is in crisis. Independent directors, in particular, are counted upon to step up to their responsibilities in difficult times. Their accumulated wisdom and judgment are crucial to make sound decisions under the pressure of time and media attention.</p><p>The overarching lesson I have distilled from the crises I’ve experienced (among them, the termination or resignation of CEOs, external financial crises such as the 2008 financial-market meltdown, major governmental action against the firm, and an unexpected takeover attempt) is that board members need to understand and trust each other. Only when they can have candid conversations will they ultimately reach a consensus that has positive and far-reaching implications for the company. Trust becomes even more important when meetings are conducted by telephone, which is often the case in crises.</p><p>The bottom line for independent directors is that their responsibilities and obligations are so great these days that they cannot serve on a board and expect to preside while fulfilling only the minimum requirements. Rather, independent directors must be fully engaged, do their best to learn the business, and stay connected between meetings. Otherwise, they won’t be prepared to lead when a crisis hits. For many independent directors, this will mean not serving on as many boards as they did in the past—a change that’s appropriate given the time it takes to be an effective board member.</p><p><strong>Role 2: CEO with nonexecutive chair</strong></p><strong>Role 2: CEO with nonexecutive chair</strong><p>In 1991, I became CEO of Medtronic, two years after joining the company as president and chief operating officer. My predecessor, who had just turned 65, continued as chair of the board. I was quite satisfied with this arrangement. His wealth of experience and wisdom were valuable to me as CEO, and he had the board’s full confidence. He was also more than willing to take on difficult assignments at my request regarding delicate government and legal issues.</p><p>This dual structure—the standard model in Europe—is preferred by most governance experts and some regulators. The split clearly distinguishes the role of management (to lead the company) from that of the board chair (to take responsibility for the board and governance).</p><p>Yet as obvious as the structure seems in principle, I have seen no evidence or research to demonstrate that split roles create superior performance or even provide greater stability at the top. Anecdotally, the opposite is often the case.</p><p>In practice, the model’s effectiveness depends on the relationship between the two individuals in these roles. If they are not squarely in agreement about the direction, leadership, and strategy of the company, an unhealthy separation may emerge within the board, and between management and the board. The result can be a lack of clear direction for the company—a state of affairs that leads to malaise or confusion within the employee ranks and, ultimately, to dissatisfied customers and shareholders. In the worst case, the two leaders engage in a power struggle that paralyzes both management and the board, thus preventing the company from making important decisions and responding quickly to changing conditions.</p><p>As much as I initially supported the separation of roles when I became CEO, over time the arrangement became more difficult. For example, some board members seemed confused about whom they should look to for strategic direction, especially in the case of acquisitions. In addition, the chair felt he should be “the eyes and ears of the board” in the company. Over time, this led to some confusion within management about his role. The board was also somewhat confused about whether I reported to him or to the board as a whole, an issue that was never fully clarified. Quite naturally, I felt that I reported to the board as a whole and that my responsibility and authority to lead the company depended on those relationships.</p><p>Tension also developed because board members seemed hesitant to give me direct feedback or to talk openly about their concerns. When I became board chair as well as CEO, this tension evaporated quickly, and I found myself spending far less time on board governance. In part, this happened because communication lines opened up and were more direct. By contrast, when the roles had been separate, I found I had to spend more time than I had expected involved in board governance and in responding to issues raised by the board.</p><p><strong>Role 3: The dual mandate</strong></p><strong>Role 3: The dual mandate</strong><p>North American CEOs strongly prefer the dual mandate of being board chair and CEO, as it puts them squarely in charge and avoids the likelihood of conflicts or power struggles within the boardroom. The downside of this model is that in the past it often encouraged complacency by boards and discouraged them from getting deeply involved in issues until it was too late.</p><p>In practical terms, a leader is most effective in dual-mandate roles when he or she starts by keeping independent directors well informed through a combination of telephone updates, monthly progress reports, and candid comments in executive sessions with the independent directors about the real-time issues facing the company. The leader must be responsive to the independent directors’ concerns and either take action on them or put them on the board agenda for discussion by the full board.</p><p>Such a leader also must learn to perform a delicate balancing act: facilitating open discussions on the board while at the same time representing management’s position to it. If this individual argues his or her case too strenuously, he or she may shut down thoughtful comments from the independent directors. On the other hand, if the individual acts solely as a facilitator of these discussions, the directors won’t get the full benefit of management’s thinking and rationale.</p><p>Having served on several boards with a single leader in the combined roles of chair and CEO, I have learned that a board is most effective when the leader clearly understands the difference between these two roles and bends over backward to respect the board’s independence. This independence extends to the directors’ need to have open discussions without the CEO present, to ensure that important issues are addressed privately.</p><p>Similarly, when I had this dual role, I did whatever I could to open up meaningful discussions within the board, especially by drawing out the opinions of its quieter members. This was particularly challenging when the board was discussing important strategic issues or acquisitions and needed the benefit of my judgments and insights. I had to learn to withhold my opinions until others had the opportunity to offer theirs and then work them into the context of my conclusions. Frequently, this meant delaying decisions until the board had time to digest the ideas or management could undertake additional analyses.</p><p>One of the benefits the board and I had was an active, capable lead director with whom I could work closely. He did a superb job in guiding the issues of the independent directors and in keeping me fully informed of any concerns and issues the board might have. When it came time to select my successor, he developed a sound process that we both agreed upon and led the board through it.</p><p>The rise of the role of lead director, elected by the independent directors, is contributing to a better separation of governance from management. To make the position work effectively, it is essential that this role have a separate job description that is publicly available and respected by the chair and CEO. The most effective lead directors view themselves as “first among equals” and can coordinate the opinions of all directors and facilitate open discussion among them.</p><p><strong>Role 4: Non-CEO chair</strong></p><strong>Role 4: Non-CEO chair</strong><p>The role played by a non-CEO board chair will depend heavily on the experience that person brings to the position. If this individual was the previous CEO—a common situation—he or she will bring a wealth of experience, a keen knowledge of the other directors, some strong opinions about what the company needs, and oftentimes a legacy to nourish or at least maintain. Therein lies the difficulty: no matter how hard old CEOs try to restrain themselves, they may have a tendency to overshadow or, worse, override new CEOs.</p><p>This problem is exacerbated by independent directors who still rely heavily on the ex-CEO’s opinions and may trust his or her recommendations more than they do those of the current CEO. Still, when former CEOs can restrain themselves, recognize that it is time to let go, and do everything they can to support their successors, they can be very effective in the role of board chair.</p><p>In my case at Medtronic, I was committed to a seamless transition with my successor and to ensuring his success and the company’s. Also, the board and I had agreed upon a timetable of just one year for me to serve as chair, so I was clearly in a transitional mode. I was still in my 50s and looking forward to turning my attention to other interests.</p><p>Nevertheless, it didn’t take long before I faced a board-level challenge. It came at an off-site board meeting just a month after the CEO transition. For 15 years, dating back to my predecessor’s tenure, Medtronic had pursued publicly announced goals of 15 percent per annum growth in both revenues and profits, compounded over any five-year period. These aggressive goals provided discipline within the company and a consistent benchmark for shareholders. We had been successful in exceeding these goals, but not without risks and challenges.</p><p>At a board meeting, however, one of the independent directors argued forcefully that given the company’s larger size, it would be impossible to continue to achieve such high rates of growth. Although I was tempted to jump into the discussion and defend the importance of the goals, I held my fire. My successor held firm, and the company stayed the course.</p><p>Many people make a strong case that a former CEO is not the right person to serve as board chair and that he or she should leave the board immediately. An alternate choice could be one of the existing directors, provided there is a well-qualified candidate available. An equally good choice is to appoint someone who has served as chair, CEO, or both at another company. In some countries, the board chair may be an independent attorney or financial expert, but this approach risks ending up with a candidate who has insufficient knowledge of the company, its business, and what it takes to lead it. Regardless of who holds the position, it must have a well-defined job description to keep accountability strong. A nonexecutive chair should be formally evaluated at least annually by fellow board members. Finally, the position should have a defined term of office, after which a new nonexecutive chair is elected or the existing chair is formally reelected.</p><p><strong>Reflections</strong></p><strong>Reflections</strong><p>The diversity of perspectives that board members bring to the role can be a considerable strength for the companies they serve. How can organizations make the most of it? Here are three suggestions.</p><ul>\n<li>The board should acknowledge that no single structure works in all cases. Boards must be pragmatic enough to adapt to the individuals involved rather than put a rigid structure in place.</li>\n<li>All parties, but especially CEOs, should acknowledge different points of view and work to minimize the conflicts that inevitably arise from them. This requires high-level listening skills, the ability to see situations from the other person’s perspective, and the wisdom to understand the basis for the different points of view.</li>\n<li>All directors, but especially CEOs, can benefit from holding different positions, either within the company or on other companies’ boards. Nominating committees should seek out prospective board members with diverse experiences. Boards should also encourage CEOs to serve on at least one outside board to give them the experience of being an independent director and seeing firsthand the challenges outside directors face.</li>\n</ul><li>The board should acknowledge that no single structure works in all cases.

      "<p><em>“Do your shareholders choose you or do you choose them? &nbsp;Sophisticated CEOs choose their investors by defining their particular business approach and strategy and ensuring that their investors are aligned with that program.”&nbsp;</em>– Bill George, former Medtronic CEO</p><em>“Do your shareholders choose you or do you choose them? &nbsp;Sophisticated CEOs choose their investors by defining their particular business approach and strategy and ensuring that their investors are aligned with that program.”&nbsp;</em><p>Startup founders eager for cash can put the long-term vision of their venture at risk if they make assumptions about investors and why they want to&nbsp;participate. Startup investors have various objectives in mind when they consider a startup,&nbsp;including financial returns, passion for the narrative, or affinity for the team involved. &nbsp;But when investors’ motivations diverge from founders’, friction ensues — so it’s up to you, as a founder, to make sure your investor’s goals align with your own.</p><p>In my nine years of building startups, I’ve heard many stories of misalignment causing entrepreneurs and investors to row in different directions. That’s why I began wondering how I would explore alignment when I co-founded&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fig.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fig</a>,&nbsp;a mission-driven startup focused on enhancing holistic wellness for consumers.</p><a href=\"http://www.fig.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fig</a><p>Importantly, alignment is different than “value add,” which is about the relevant skills, connections, and reputation that an investor provides your company. Value add is important, but it isn’t everything. &nbsp;Alignment is sharing commitment to the same mission, values, and time horizon.</p><p>Here are a few approaches I’ve found helpful for exploring fit along these dimensions:</p><p><strong>1. Define your mission and values and share them early.</strong></p><strong>1. Define your mission and values and share them early.</strong><p>What is the purpose of your venture? &nbsp;What principles are most important to your founding team? &nbsp;What are your objectives and exit plans? &nbsp;This clarity will help with evaluating investors, team members, and other kinds of of partners. Clearly articulating these values, as companies like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/05/twilios-nine-things.html\" target=\"_blank\">Twilio have done</a>, is also important for creating a reinforcing culture. At Fig we aim to incorporate&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fig.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">our values</a>&nbsp;into every hiring, investor, and partnership decision.</p><a href=\"http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2012/05/twilios-nine-things.html\" target=\"_blank\">Twilio have done</a><a href=\"http://fig.com/about\" target=\"_blank\">our values</a><p>After determining your mission and values, ensure investors know they are important by sending them in your pre-pitch deck. Including 1-2 slides on mission and values as part of a 5-6 pre-pitch deck will not only highlight their importance to you but also allow investors to self-select based on compatibility — saving both of you time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Share specific instances of your values in action.</strong></p><strong>2. Share specific instances of your values in action.</strong><p>Give specific examples of your behavior that illustrate your commitment to your mission and/or values. While many investors are hoping you’ll build an enduring and consequential company, others are hoping for a quick flip.</p><p>When I told potential investors that my co-founder Bart and I rejected our&nbsp;first acquisition&nbsp;offer largely because we were not convinced it would lead to furthering our mission, I was conveying our commitment to building a mission-driven company over the long term. My goal was to weed out investors hoping for a quick exit.</p><p><strong>3. References are a must.</strong></p><strong>3. References are a must.</strong><p>You wouldn’t make a key hire without checking their references. Do the same for potential investors. Leverage your network of friends, mentors, and former colleagues to both find and screen potential investors. Your friends are likely to share at least some of your values and know others who hold similar priorities. Structure these discussions beforehand to honor your friends’ time. Your company’s mission and values should determine what you’re solving for.</p><p><strong>4. Be transparent with your due diligence.</strong></p><strong>4. Be transparent with your due diligence.</strong><p>Sometimes it’s impossible to evaluate alignment before a meeting. If an investor seems keen on moving forward, let them know you plan to talk with mutual contacts. I’ve found it helpful to ground this “heads up” in a spirit of reciprocity.</p><p>While raising funding for&nbsp;Fig, I would say, “I want you to be confident in who you’re investing in, Mr. Investor. Feel free to talk to anyone I’ve worked with in the past — I’m even happy to introduce you to one or two Fig investors. I plan to call one or two of my friends who have worked with you. I want both of us to enter this partnership with eyes wide open.”</p><p><strong>5. Pay attention to your emotions and internal dialogue during pitching conversations.</strong></p><strong>5. Pay attention to your emotions and internal dialogue during pitching conversations.</strong><p>Building a company will definitely have its ups and downs. Choose investors you want to spend time with at the peak&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;in the valley. Quality time means enough time to accumulate sufficient firsthand data for your mind and impressions for your gut. In my experience, most investors will want two conversations with you before they invest. During these conversations, ask yourself, “Do I want to spend more time with this person or less? Would I be proud to introduce this investor to my team?”</p><em>and</em><p>Investors are key business partners; misalignment with investors has the potential to negatively affect all other areas of your business.&nbsp; Prioritize alignment from the beginning, and enjoy the benefits of everyone rowing in the same direction.</p><p><em>Kevon Saber is cofounder of&nbsp;</em><a title=\"Fig.com \" href=\"http://www.fig.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Fig</em></a><em>, a mobile startup focused on personal wellbeing.&nbsp;Prior to Fig, Kevon co-founded GenPlay Games, a mobile games developer which has created 15 games and $40+ million in revenue.

They never forgot that the company was an egalitarian organization focused on innovations that met their customers’ needs. Trying to compete with H.P. in its prime was very difficult because of its innovative products, superior customer service and product quality.</p><p>The founders also created a financial model that enabled the company to sustain its growth for 40 years: grow revenue at 20 percent, maintain 20 percent operating margins, and reinvest approximately 10 percent of revenue in research and development.

      "<p>By <a href=\"http://www.agendaweek.com/email-contributor/107602/439702/49442\" target=\"_blank\">Jack Buehrer</a> for Agenda</p><a href=\"http://www.agendaweek.com/email-contributor/107602/439702/49442\" target=\"_blank\">Jack Buehrer</a><p>Executives and directors in the banking and financial services sector are waiting with bated breath to see whom President&nbsp;<strong>Barack Obama</strong>&nbsp;will name to key oversight posts in his second term. Those appointments, they say, will essentially predict how friendly to Wall Street the business environment will be over the next four years.</p><strong>Barack Obama</strong><p>Obama’s reelection, as well as the surprising gains that increased the Democratic majority in the Senate, have all but eliminated financial firms’ hopes for a substantial weakening or outright repeal of the regulations laid out in Dodd-Frank. Though the financial sector largely backed Obama in 2008, it broke decisively for Romney this year, prompting questions about how the president will govern Wall Street between now and 2016. Some say he has fences to mend after his relationship with U.S. banks soured over the last four years, while others wonder if he’ll double down on enforcement.</p><p>“What we need now is clarity,” says&nbsp;<strong>William George</strong>, a director on the&nbsp;<strong>Goldman Sachs Group </strong>board who also teaches management at&nbsp;<strong>Harvard&nbsp;</strong>Business School. “These regulations aren’t going anywhere, but it’s now four years after the crash, and nobody knows what the rules are. That’s what makes compliance difficult.”</p><strong>William George</strong><strong>Goldman Sachs Group </strong><strong>Harvard&nbsp;</strong><p>The first window into the president’s plans will likely be his selection of a new secretary of the Treasury after&nbsp;<strong>Timothy Geithner</strong>&nbsp;steps down in January. Geithner drew criticism throughout Obama’s first term for being soft on the biggest banks and too much of a Wall Street insider, even though he has spent his entire career as a civil servant. “The new Treasury secretary will tell us whether the president wants to work with us or not,” says George.</p><strong>Timothy Geithner</strong><p><strong>Jack Lew</strong>, the current White House chief of staff, and&nbsp;<strong>Erskine Bowles</strong>, former co-chair of Obama’s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, are considered leading candidates. Other names making the rounds include&nbsp;<strong>BlackRock</strong>&nbsp;CEO&nbsp;<strong>Larry Fink</strong>&nbsp;and former<strong>FDIC</strong>&nbsp;chief<strong>&nbsp;Sheila Bair</strong>. Any of those four choices would probably sail through the confirmation process with relative ease. More important for business leaders, none are thought to take a radical attitude toward regulating the financial sector.</p><strong>Jack Lew</strong><strong>Erskine Bowles</strong><strong>BlackRock</strong><strong>Larry Fink</strong><strong>FDIC</strong><strong>&nbsp;Sheila Bair</strong><p>Other upcoming appointments for Obama will almost certainly include a new&nbsp;<strong>SEC </strong>chairman and possibly a new&nbsp;<strong>CFTC&nbsp;</strong>chief. SEC chair&nbsp;<strong>Mary Schapiro</strong>&nbsp;is widely rumored to be planning on stepping down at the end of the year, and many observers think CFTC head&nbsp;<strong>Gary Gensler</strong>&nbsp;could have a tough time getting confirmed by the Senate should Obama nominate him again.</p><strong>SEC </strong><strong>CFTC&nbsp;</strong><strong>Mary Schapiro</strong><strong>Gary Gensler</strong><p>“These appointments will definitely signal which way the president wants to go,” says <strong>Gary Costley</strong>, managing partner of&nbsp;<strong>C&amp;G Capital and Management</strong>&nbsp;and a director at&nbsp;<strong>Principal Financial Group</strong>. “One thing people should look forward to, though, is a president’s second-term cabinet tends to be much better than the first term. A president in his first term owes so much to so many, but now [Obama] won’t have to run again.”</p><strong>Gary Costley</strong><strong>C&amp;G Capital and Management</strong><strong>Principal Financial Group</strong><p>Of course, the prospect of an Obama who doesn’t need to worry about reelection is just what has many Wall Streeters on edge. But&nbsp;<strong>Michael Greenberger</strong>, a former CFTC regulator who now teaches law at the&nbsp;<strong>University of Maryland</strong>, says financial sector directors and executives will probably see a more evenhanded approach from the White House than they expect.</p><strong>Michael Greenberger</strong><strong>University of Maryland</strong><p>“I think Wall Street is very lucky that Obama is not a vindictive person,” he says. “I don’t think you’ll see a double-down on Dodd-Frank. I think the president will want to see that it gets fully implemented to the extent that he can, but I don’t think we’ll see any new legislative efforts that try to go further than Dodd-Frank already has.”</p>"

      "<p align=\"left\">I held back from the 2012 election, in part through taking the Howard Schultz pledge not to give money to any candidate until Washington decides to focus on America’s issues rather than partisan politics. No one noticed my absence except those dozens of robo-callers who learned that “William and Ann don’t live here.” Penny and I instead gave the money to our family foundation where we decided it would do a lot more good – in health care, leadership, spirituality and our community.</p><p align=\"left\">I grew up in a Republican family when it was a privilege to be part of a respectable group of people who believed in fiscal conservatism (i.e., living within your means) and social progressivism (i.e., accepting people for who they are, regardless of their differences from me).&nbsp; In recent years moderates like me have nowhere to go.</p><p align=\"left\">The political architects of the modern Republican party, like Karl Rove, have built a coalition that emphasizes social conservatism at the expense of fiscal moderation (reasonable tax policy <em>and </em>reasonable expenditures).&nbsp; In this party, there is no room for moderate Republicans – decent leaders like my friends Sen. David Durenberger, Prof. David Gergen, Tad Piper, Sec. John Whitehead, Rep. Jim Ramstad, Gov. Al Quie and Gov. Arnie Carlson.&nbsp; Even my Grand Rapids neighbor President Jerry Ford would not have passed the ideological purity test of today’s Republican primaries. President Ford told my wife shortly before his death that if he were to run for office, he would have to run as a Democrat. So I became an independent who voted for George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, and supported President Obama’s 2008 message of hope.</p><em>and </em><p align=\"left\">Having lived through twelve years of Presidents who are fiscal liberals, I agonize as I see my generation bequeathing a mountain of debt to our children and grandchildren with entitlements so large they will bury all reasonable government programs. In the end, I voted for Obama – largely to keep the extremists in Romney’s party out of power.&nbsp; After all, who could affiliate with Senate candidates like Todd Akin who spoke of “legitimate rape” and Richard Murdoch who said that women are raped because “God intended it”?</p><p align=\"left\">I now find myself part of a dying breed: an over-45, white, heterosexual, Protestant male college graduate with an income over $50,000. For decades our demographic held most of the leadership roles in this country, but we long ago became the small minority of American voters. Strangely, the Republican Party hasn’t yet figured that out. This was the <em>only</em> sub-group of voters that went solidly for Governor Romney, in part reflecting a desire to return to the “good old days.” (The good old days were never as good as we remember.) Meanwhile, I don’t want to be identified by this dying breed! I love my friends who are like me in demographic terms, but I also love my friends who are females, blacks, Hispanics, Asians, gays, Hindus, Buddhists, Jews and Muslims, and immigrants.</p><em>only</em><p align=\"left\">Sadly, I anticipate four more years of political gridlock in Washington. &nbsp;Even if we escape the fiscal cliff, there will soon be yet another politically-motivated game of “Chicken.” Rather than spend wasted hours endlessly debating federal politics, I recommend following the sage advice of Robert F. Kennedy, who said in 1966, “Few will have the greatness to bend history itself; but each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation.”</p><p align=\"left\">This generation can have the greatest impact by making a difference in our own environment: our communities, companies, non-profit organizations, churches and synagogues, and local governments.&nbsp; Rather than playing politics, these organizations focus on the big problems troubling us: poverty, homelessness, global peace, education, job creation, the environment and healthy living.</p><p align=\"left\">The future belongs to those who would unite us as one people, <em>because of </em>not<em> in spite of</em> our differences, and who are willing to work together to solve intractable problems. They are the real leaders.</p><em>because of </em><em> in spite of</em><div></div>"

      "<p>By Julia Hanna for <a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6967.html\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Business School Working Knowledge</a></p><a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6967.html\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Business School Working Knowledge</a><p>What&nbsp;skills do today’s executives need to develop to become effective global leaders of tomorrow? And how do corporations teach these skills to their own leaders?</p><p>“The shift from a country centric corporation to one that is more global in its outlook will have a radical impact on leadership development,” says Professor of Management Practice William George, the former chairman and chief executive officer of Medtronic.</p><p>George developed and taught for many years the popular second-year MBA course Authentic Leadership Development (ALD), which he has compressed into a five-day Executive Education program at Harvard Business School.</p><p>“The most successful leaders will not necessarily be those with the highest IQ,” he says. “Of course, they will need to be intelligent. But they’ll also need to have a high level of cultural and emotional intelligence.”</p><p>According to George, additional characteristics of a successful global leader include:</p><ul>\n<li>An&nbsp;<strong>intellectual understanding</strong>&nbsp;of the global business context—in other words, an ability to comprehend just how complex it can be to do business around the world.</li>\n<li>The capacity to simultaneously develop a&nbsp;<strong>global and local perspective</strong>. “This is much easier said than done,” George says. “And it’s almost impossible to achieve without a great deal of experience living in different parts of the world.”</li>\n<li>Being able to&nbsp;<strong>overcome the dominant thinking</strong>&nbsp;at headquarters. “Leadership has to lean in favor of nondominant thinking,” says George. “That requires a tremendous amount of intercultural empathy and a passion for diversity in life experiences.” In other words: “An insatiable need to learn about other cultures.”</li>\n<li>A knack for&nbsp;<strong>cross-boundary partnering</strong>. “You need to feel comfortable engaging a team in India and giving them as much power as a team in Germany or the United States. There’s a certain level of executive leadership maturity involved in having the respect and capacity to pull the best out of each area of the corporation.”</li>\n<li>A self-awareness and self-assurance when it comes to one’s&nbsp;<strong>values and sense of purpose</strong>. At the same time, however, “you need to be flexible in learning from and empowering others.”</li>\n<li>The ability to&nbsp;<strong>develop networks</strong>&nbsp;that are internal and external to the organization. “It’s a process of shifting from vertical management to horizontal collaboration. One’s title and role are far less important than the capacity to get things done.”</li>\n</ul><li>An&nbsp;<strong>intellectual understanding</strong>&nbsp;of the global business context—in other words, an ability to comprehend just how complex it can be to do business around the world.</li><strong>intellectual understanding</strong><li>The capacity to simultaneously develop a&nbsp;<strong>global and local perspective</strong>. “This is much easier said than done,” George says. “And it’s almost impossible to achieve without a great deal of experience living in different parts of the world.”</li><strong>global and local perspective</strong><li>Being able to&nbsp;<strong>overcome the dominant thinking</strong>&nbsp;at headquarters. “Leadership has to lean in favor of nondominant thinking,” says George. “That requires a tremendous amount of intercultural empathy and a passion for diversity in life experiences.” In other words: “An insatiable need to learn about other cultures.”</li><strong>overcome the dominant thinking</strong><li>A knack for&nbsp;<strong>cross-boundary partnering</strong>. “You need to feel comfortable engaging a team in India and giving them as much power as a team in Germany or the United States.

One’s title and role are far less important than the capacity to get things done.”</li><strong>develop networks</strong><p>How should one cultivate these qualities? One of George’s first recommendations for would-be global leaders is to live in a country where the language spoken is different from that in one’s home country.</p><p>“When my wife and I lived in Japan we had a two-year-old child, which meant we had to dive in and learn very quickly,” he recalls. “Doing this gives you a heightened sensitivity to cultural differences, and how those differences are tied up in language.”</p><p>After 60 or so hours of Japanese language instruction, George could more or less carry on a conversation, and did so with a retired chairman of Mitsubishi—who gently informed him that he was speaking “female Japanese.”</p><p><strong>Get lost</strong></p><strong>Get lost</strong><p>“These are great learning experiences,” he says. “The first weekend after I had moved to Belgium, I asked someone how I should explore and get to know the place. I was told to go get lost, which is great advice. It’s about really engaging in the culture and learning to be vulnerable.”</p><p>Accepting one’s vulnerabilities is a primary objective of ALD, which requires participants to work together in six-person groups.</p><p>“It’s more than a knowledge transfer from HBS to individuals; it’s also an exchange between people and a process of understanding who I am, what I desire, what is my purpose, and what are my values,” says George, who notes that this year the number of participants who can enroll in ALD has doubled to 240 people.</p><p>Also coming next July is The Global Enterprise Leader, a course developed with Professor Krishna Palepu that will extend ALD’s objectives to include cultivating a greater capacity for cultural intelligence. “It’s not so much about understanding geopolitics,” George says. “The characteristics that I’ve cited above are far more important.”</p><p>Aligning employees across a diversity of geographies and experiences is easier said than done, George concedes, although he does highlight a few standouts, including Coca-Cola (which has had five non-American CEOs), Nestlé, Unilever, Siemens, IBM, and Novartis, among others.</p><p>“Ultimately, a global organization is measured by how well the diversity of its leadership reflects the diversity of its customer base and how well that leadership can leverage the skills of teams working around the world,” he says, adding that Medtronic’s CEO is Omar Ishrak, a native of Bangladesh who was educated in London and has worked in the United States for nearly 20 years.</p><p>“We’re looking to companies to create a global cadre of people who are comfortable operating anywhere in the world,” George concludes. “That’s where we’re heading.”</p>"

To grapple with and get authenticity one needs to grapple with human existence (being and doing).&nbsp; And in particular one needs to suspend one’s existing listening (how one thinks of, relates to) of authenticity.&nbsp; Furthermore, it takes courage as the conversation of authenticity/inauthenticity unconceals that which we are committed to keeping hidden.&nbsp; If you are not up for this today then I suggest that you go and do something else.&nbsp; If you are up for the conversation then let’s begin.</p><p><strong>What constitutes authenticity in this ontological model of leadership?</strong></p><strong>What constitutes authenticity in this ontological model of leadership?</strong><p>At a superficial level being authentic is being genuine, being real -”the real thing”.&nbsp; Dive into this, grapple with this, and you are likely to find yourself grappling with the question “How does a human being determine when he/she is being genuine, being real?”&nbsp; Put differently, “Genuine/real with regards to what exactly?”&nbsp; Think of it this way,&nbsp; determining whether this iPad before me is a genuine Apple iPad is a different realm of enquiry to determining if I/you are being genuine/real/authentic in the way that I/you show up in the world.&nbsp; Yet we need to ring-fence it if we are to grapple with it.</p><p>In the ontological model of leadership, Werner Erhard et al are clear on what constitutes authenticity.&nbsp; They define authenticity as:</p><p>“<strong><em>being and acting&nbsp; consistent with who you hold yourself out to be for others, and who you hold yourself out to be for yourself”.&nbsp;</em></strong></p><strong><em>being and acting&nbsp; consistent with who you hold yourself out to be for others, and who you hold yourself out to be for yourself”.&nbsp;</em></strong><em>being and acting&nbsp; consistent with who you hold yourself out to be for others, and who you hold yourself out to be for yourself”.&nbsp;</em><p>Notice that central to this definition is&nbsp;<strong>‘who you hold yourself out to be’</strong>: not your personality, not your thoughts, not your feelings, not social convention…… How to make sense of ‘who you hold yourself to be’? Think of it as a declaration that you make, a stand that you take on yourself, a commitment to a set of values and/or specific future.</p><strong>‘who you hold yourself out to be’</strong><p><strong>Authenticity is central to leadership and being a leader</strong></p><strong>Authenticity is central to leadership and being a leader</strong><p>How to position the importance of authenticity to leadership?&nbsp; Perhaps it is best to share the words of Bill George, former CEO of Medtronic, Harvard Business School Professor of Leadership, and best-selling author:</p><p><strong><em>“After years of studying leaders and their traits, I believe that leadership begins and ends with authenticity.”&nbsp;</em></strong></p><strong><em>“After years of studying leaders and their traits, I believe that leadership begins and ends with authenticity.”&nbsp;</em></strong><em>“After years of studying leaders and their traits, I believe that leadership begins and ends with authenticity.”&nbsp;</em><p>Werner Erhard et al write:</p><p><strong><em>“Being a leader requires that you are absolutely authentic, and true authenticity begins with being authentic about your inauthenticities, and almost no one does this.”</em></strong></p><strong><em>“Being a leader requires that you are absolutely authentic, and true authenticity begins with being authentic about your inauthenticities, and almost no one does this.”</em></strong><em>“Being a leader requires that you are absolutely authentic, and true authenticity begins with being authentic about your inauthenticities, and almost no one does this.”</em><p>Did you get that?&nbsp; The access to authenticity is being authentic (confronting the truth) about where/how you are being inauthentic (not being/acting in accordance with ‘who you hold yourself out to be’).&nbsp; Yet, almost no one does this.&nbsp; Do you remember how the business world reacted to Domino’s Pizza decision to come out in 2010 and tell the truth about their pizzas? Surprise, bafflement, astonishment: What, you are going to own up to the fact that your pizzas taste like cardboard!</p><p><strong>Inauthenticity is ubiquitous</strong></p><strong>Inauthenticity is ubiquitous</strong><p><strong>Inauthenticity is the default setting and state of human existence. You, I and just about everyone is being&nbsp; inauthentic – at the very least in some ways, at certain times, with certain people and in certain situations.</strong>&nbsp; To date I have distinguished two kinds of inauthenticity.</p><strong>Inauthenticity is the default setting and state of human existence. You, I and just about everyone is being&nbsp; inauthentic – at the very least in some ways, at certain times, with certain people and in certain situations.</strong><p><strong>First, there is the kind where I, you, sacrifice our personality, character, spirit, stand in response to external pressures</strong>: the pressure to appear to be a certain kind of person, the pressure to adopt a particular mode of living, the pressure to ignore one’s own moral and aesthetic objections in order to have a more comfortable existence. If you take the time to reflect and are willing to be open to that which shows up then you will see where and how often you have trodden this path.&nbsp; Else read Sartre’s novels – they provide a great access to the inauthentic mode of being/living.</p><strong>First, there is the kind where I, you, sacrifice our personality, character, spirit, stand in response to external pressures</strong><p><strong>The second kind of inauthenticity is of the kind which is normally hidden from us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>This kind of inauthenticity lies in the realm of what we don’t know that we don’t know: we do not have access to our real reasons for being the way that we are being, acting the way that we are acting, and we ignore crucial facts about own lives (and the world we find ourselves in) in order to avoid facing up to and confronting uncomfortable truths. Spend some time in the counselling room and you will see this vividly: you cannot help seeing how the human being is blind to certain aspects of him/herself. Or just watch the TV series “The Office”.</p><strong>The second kind of inauthenticity is of the kind which is normally hidden from us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Heart of the matter: we refuse to confront our inauthenticities</strong></p><strong>Heart of the matter: we refuse to confront our inauthenticities</strong><p>Imagine that you are driving a car and you find that you have a flat tyre.&nbsp; Having a flat tyre is not an issue provided you are willing to acknowledge and confront the fact that you are driving a car with a flat tyre.&nbsp; Acknowledging and confronting the fact creates an opening for you to take effective action: to replace or repair the flat tyre.&nbsp; It is the same with inauthenticity: inauthenticity is not an issue if you and I are willing to confront where/how we are being inauthentic.</p><p>Yet inauthenticity is an issue.&nbsp; It is an issue because you and I are not willing to confront our inauthenticities.&nbsp; Here is what Werner Erhard et al have to say on the matter:</p><p><strong><em>“..because we avoid at all costs confronting our inauthenticities, we are consistently inauthentic about being inauthentic – not only with others, but with ourselves as well.”&nbsp;</em></strong></p><strong><em>“..because we avoid at all costs confronting our inauthenticities, we are consistently inauthentic about being inauthentic – not only with others, but with ourselves as well.”&nbsp;</em></strong><em>“..because we avoid at all costs confronting our inauthenticities, we are consistently inauthentic about being inauthentic – not only with others, but with ourselves as well.”&nbsp;</em><p>If you find this assertion hard to stomach then allow me to share with you the conclusion that Harvard Professor&nbsp;Chris Argyris&nbsp;came to after spending 40 years studying human beings and organisations:</p><p><strong><em>“Put simply, people consistently act inconsistently, unaware of the contradiction between their espoused theory and their theory-in-use, between the way they think they are acting, and they way they really act.”</em></strong></p><strong><em>“Put simply, people consistently act inconsistently, unaware of the contradiction between their espoused theory and their theory-in-use, between the way they think they are acting, and they way they really act.”</em></strong><em>“Put simply, people consistently act inconsistently, unaware of the contradiction between their espoused theory and their theory-in-use, between the way they think they are acting, and they way they really act.”</em><p><strong>Want to be a leader? Generate the courage to be authentic about your inauthenticities</strong></p><strong>Want to be a leader? Generate the courage to be authentic about your inauthenticities</strong><p>By now it should be clear that being authentic is absolutely essential to being a leader and the exercise of leadership.&nbsp; It should also be clear that the default setting of human existence is inauthenticity and as such inauthenticity is ubiquitous.&nbsp; So one critical challenge of being a leader is to life oneself up from this fallen state of inauthenticity.&nbsp; This is how Werner Erhard et al put it:</p><p><strong><em>“If you cannot find the courage to be authentic about your inauthenticities, you can forget about being a leader……..The actionable access to authenticity is being authentic about your inauthenticities..”</em></strong></p><strong><em>“If you cannot find the courage to be authentic about your inauthenticities, you can forget about being a leader……..The actionable access to authenticity is being authentic about your inauthenticities..”</em></strong><em>“If you cannot find the courage to be authentic about your inauthenticities, you can forget about being a leader……..The actionable access to authenticity is being authentic about your inauthenticities..”</em><p>As a pragmatic course of action it means that you must:</p><p><strong>Be willing (and proactive) in discovering and confronting your inauthenticities</strong>&nbsp;– where in our lives you are not being and/or acting consistent with who you hold yourself out to be for others&nbsp;<strong>AND&nbsp;</strong>who you hold yourself out to be for yourself; AND</p><strong>Be willing (and proactive) in discovering and confronting your inauthenticities</strong><strong>AND&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Tell the truth (to yourself and the appropriate people) about where you are not being genuine, real, authentic</strong>&nbsp;– the appropriate people tend to be the one’s that you are most likely to resist telling the truth to.</p><strong>Tell the truth (to yourself and the appropriate people) about where you are not being genuine, real, authentic</strong><p><strong>If you are willing to take this on then take a look at these areas</strong></p><strong>If you are willing to take this on then take a look at these areas</strong><p>By virtue of human there are certain domains of life that suck us towards/into a state of being inauthentic. So if you are up for being a leader (or simply up for a life of freedom, self-esteem, courage and peace of mind) then take a look at the following:</p><p><strong>Most of us are driven to look good and avoid looking bad.</strong>&nbsp; Werner Erhard et al put it this way&nbsp;<em>“.. most of us have a pathetic need for looking good, and almost none of us is willing to confront just how much we care about looking good..”</em>&nbsp; Look, how many of us are afraid to ask a question or voice our opinion for the fear of looking stupid, the only one who does not get it?&nbsp; I say the reason so many of us insist on being right (rather than admit we are/were wrong) is to look good and avoid looking bad.&nbsp; Where are you sacrificing your authenticity simply to look good and avoid looking bad?&nbsp; If you do the work you will find a gold mine of inauthenticity here; it would not be going to far to say that wanting to look good and avoid looking bad runs us!</p><strong>Most of us are driven to look good and avoid looking bad.</strong><em>“.. most of us have a pathetic need for looking good, and almost none of us is willing to confront just how much we care about looking good..”</em><p><strong>Every single one of us wants to be admired (</strong>to be recognised as a person of worth/significance/importance/high status), and yet almost none of us is willing to be with and confront how desperately we want to be admired.&nbsp; And how readily we will give up our authentic voice, our stand, in a situation where we perceive that being straightforward, honest, genuine threatens us with a loss of admiration.</p><strong>Every single one of us wants to be admired (</strong><p><strong>In many situations, many of us want to be seen as being loyal members of the group even when we are not</strong>.&nbsp; How many of us are playing at being loyal simply to avoid the consequences (loss of admiration, looking bad, being made out to be wrong, being punished) of being perceived as being not loyal, not a team player.&nbsp; Have you noticed how easily you will sacrifice ‘who you hold yourself out to be’ for the sake of fitting in, being admired and rewarded?&nbsp; This is how you get ‘groupthink’ and the ‘Bay of Pigs’ fiasco and many others like it in organisations.</p><strong>In many situations, many of us want to be seen as being loyal members of the group even when we are not</strong><p><strong>The good news if you are up for being a leader</strong></p><strong>The good news if you are up for being a leader</strong><p>So far this post might just show up in your listening as ‘bad news’ and leave you deflated/resigned/cynical.&nbsp; So I want to share another quote from Werner Erhard et al:</p><p><strong><em>“We are all guilty of being small in these ways – it comes with being human.&nbsp; Great leaders are noteworthy in having come to grips with these foibles of being human – not eliminating them, but being the masters of these weaknesses when they are leading.”</em></strong></p><strong><em>“We are all guilty of being small in these ways – it comes with being human.&nbsp; Great leaders are noteworthy in having come to grips with these foibles of being human – not eliminating them, but being the masters of these weaknesses when they are leading.”</em></strong><em>“We are all guilty of being small in these ways – it comes with being human.&nbsp; Great leaders are noteworthy in having come to grips with these foibles of being human – not eliminating them, but being the masters of these weaknesses when they are leading.”</em><p><strong>And finally</strong></p><strong>And finally</strong><p>If you wish to get a taste of authenticity/inauthenticity (and its importance to the human condition) then I recommend reading Book VI:The Russian Monk, Chapter 1:The Elder Zosima and His Visitors, Section (d) The Mysterious Stranger, from Fydor Dostoevsky’s masterpiece: The Brothers Karamazov.&nbsp; If you have the hardback edition by Pevear and Volokhonsky then the page number is 301.</p><p>In the next post in this series I will take a look at the third foundational strand of the ontological leadership model: being committed to something bigger than oneself.</p><p>For those of you who have made it this far, I thank you for putting into this conversation that which it takes to be in this conversation.&nbsp; I am grateful that you exist and that I have the privilege of being in this conversation with you.&nbsp; I look forward to listening to your perspective, your experience on authenticity.</p>"

      "<p>From CNN Money: <a href=\"http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/10/15/porter-rivlin-economy-fix/\" target=\"_blank\">http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/10/15/porter-rivlin-economy-fix/</a></p><a href=\"http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/10/15/porter-rivlin-economy-fix/\" target=\"_blank\">http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/10/15/porter-rivlin-economy-fix/</a><p>By Michael Porter and Jan Rivkin</p><p>FORTUNE – America’s feeble economy reminds us every day that our global competitiveness is in trouble. Whose fault is that? As usual in today’s political environment, most opinions are extreme. One camp holds that national competitiveness is the responsibility of policymakers, not business leaders, who need to focus on running their companies. The opposite camp says companies owe loyalty to the country that supports them, and executives who move “American jobs” overseas are “Benedict Arnold CEOs.” Both positions are deeply flawed, reflecting simplistic views of how competition and economies really work.</p><p>We offer a third perspective. Managers must run their companies well. But every firm draws on the business environment in the communities where it operates, or the “commons,” as our colleagues&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hbr.org/2009/07/restoring-american-competitiveness/ar/1\" target=\"_blank\">Gary Pisano and Willy Shih call it</a>. Government has a profound impact on the health of the commons and must do its part to make the U.S. attractive for business. At the same time, business leaders influence the commons on which they draw. In doing so, they open up a valuable opportunity: When a firm improves the commons, it often boosts its own profitability while also advancing the prospects of other U.S.-based businesses. That means&nbsp;<a href=\"http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/09/04/us-companies-stagnant-economy/\" target=\"_blank\">business leaders shouldn’t simply accept</a>&nbsp;the business environment as a given, set by government. They can — and should — enhance the commons in ways that boost their own long-run profits.</p><a href=\"http://hbr.org/2009/07/restoring-american-competitiveness/ar/1\" target=\"_blank\">Gary Pisano and Willy Shih call it</a><a href=\"http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/09/04/us-companies-stagnant-economy/\" target=\"_blank\">business leaders shouldn’t simply accept</a><p>To understand why that’s critical to America’s future, we need to be clear on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/09/06/michael-porter-harvard/\" target=\"_blank\">what competitiveness means</a>. The U.S. is competitive to the extent that firms operating here can compete successfully in the global economy while supporting high and rising living standards for the average American. Doing one without the other means we aren’t really competitive. A high-wage economy like the U.S. can achieve both only by being a highly productive location, one where firms can create innovative, distinctive products and produce them efficiently.</p><a href=\"http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2012/09/06/michael-porter-harvard/\" target=\"_blank\">what competitiveness means</a><p>In&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Business School’s project on U.S. competitiveness</a>, we and other faculty have examined how business can lead in restoring U.S. competitiveness. Our own and our colleagues’ work point to three ways.</p><a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Business School’s project on U.S. competitiveness</a><p><strong>Pursue productivity</strong></p><strong>Pursue productivity</strong><p>First and most important, managers must run their U.S. operations well, vigorously pursuing productivity and profitability within the rules set by society. In part, this means positioning U.S.-based activities to draw on unique American strengths. For instance, La-Z-Boy has avoided head-to-head competition with low-wage Asian furniture manufacturers by emphasizing the customization and faster delivery that its U.S. location and worker skills make possible.</p><p>Contrary to recent political posturing, running U.S. operations well does not always mean staying at home.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/14/news/economy/outsourcing-jobs/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Going overseas</a>&nbsp;often improves U.S. competitiveness by allowing U.S. companies to better penetrate foreign markets through better customer support, adapting products to local needs, and more efficient logistics. Our colleagues&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=32615\" target=\"_blank\">Mihir Desai, Fritz Foley, and James Hines</a> have found that U.S. multinationals that expand faster abroad also tend to grow faster in America. At the same time, well-run companies do bring activities back to America as costs rise overseas and managers feel&nbsp;<a href=\"http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/07/22/banging-the-drum-to-bring-jobs-back-home/\" target=\"_blank\">offshoring’s hidden costs</a>, such as lower foreign worker productivity, quality problems, and loss of intellectual property. When Chesapeake Bay Candle moved production from Vietnam to Maryland, for instance, it avoided 15% to 20% annual wage inflation, cut shipping costs, met the fast-delivery demands of retailers, and slashed inventory costs.</p><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/09/14/news/economy/outsourcing-jobs/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Going overseas</a><a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=32615\" target=\"_blank\">Mihir Desai, Fritz Foley, and James Hines</a><a href=\"http://finance.fortune.cnn.com/2011/07/22/banging-the-drum-to-bring-jobs-back-home/\" target=\"_blank\">offshoring’s hidden costs</a><p><strong>Build the commons and the business</strong></p><strong>Build the commons and the business</strong><p>Many companies overlook such opportunities because they think too narrowly about the potential impact of their communities on their own success. Companies used to invest naturally in the commons, but globalization weakened the connection, and many companies forgot the importance of local conditions for their productivity and growth. But now a growing number of business leaders are rediscovering the critical role of the local business environment. They’re relearning that without available skills, for example, companies have to bear the full cost of training or even relocate to find&nbsp;<a href=\"http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/09/18/smart-company-strategies/\" target=\"_blank\">qualified employees</a>&nbsp;at a reasonable cost. Without an adequate supplier base, companies may be forced to relocate operations or bear higher costs of bringing in components, machinery, or service providers from elsewhere.</p><a href=\"http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2012/09/18/smart-company-strategies/\" target=\"_blank\">qualified employees</a><p>The welcome news is that companies can strengthen the commons, without waiting for government, in ways that are good for themselves and for America. The work of our colleagues Pisano and Shih,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hbr.org/2012/03/reviving-entrepreneurship/ar/1\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Sahlman</a>, Bill George, and especially&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/faculty/rkanter.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rosabeth Moss Kanter</a> points to several opportunities.</p><a href=\"http://hbr.org/2012/03/reviving-entrepreneurship/ar/1\" target=\"_blank\">Bill Sahlman</a><a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/faculty/rkanter.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rosabeth Moss Kanter</a><p><strong>Improving skills.</strong>&nbsp;Many companies rely passively on high schools, vocational-technical programs, community colleges, and universities to create a pool of skilled labor, and then supplement those with internal training. But that approach isn’t producing the talent business needs. Despite national unemployment above 8%,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/08/smallbusiness/Indiana-manufacturing-jobs/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">many companies can’t find workers</a>&nbsp;with the skills to fill open jobs.</p><strong>Improving skills.</strong><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2012/08/08/smallbusiness/Indiana-manufacturing-jobs/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\">many companies can’t find workers</a><p>Now some companies are getting far more proactive. Individually and collectively, as Rosabeth Kanter and our MIT colleague&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/faculty/tkochan.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Kochan</a>&nbsp;have emphasized, they’re partnering with educational institutions and providing curricular guidance, mentoring, instructors, equipment, and even facilities so schools produce workers these companies would love to hire.</p><a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/competitiveness/faculty/tkochan.html\" target=\"_blank\">Tom Kochan</a><p>In Charlotte, N.C., Siemens (<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=SI\" target=\"_blank\">SI</a>) has collaborated with Central Piedmont Community College to design courses and apprenticeships that give workers the advanced manufacturing skills that Siemens needs.</p><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=SI\" target=\"_blank\">SI</a><p>Southwire, a growing maker of cable and wire based in rural Carrollton, Ga., couldn’t meet its increasing need for high school grads because too many students were dropping out. So the company created a factory with built-in classrooms. Partnering with the county school system, it recruited students at risk of dropping out to join the 12 for Life program. Each day, the students attend four hours of traditional classes at the factory or their home school and then work a four-hour paid shift, learning production skills from company mentors, rotating among workstations, and shipping product. Students have achieved high graduation rates, with 21% hired as full-time Southwire employees and 39% going on to higher education. Seeing a positive return on its $2.5 million investment, Southwire has already built a second 12 for Life facility.</p><p>Siemens and Southwire see their efforts as ways to build their businesses, not as community service. But both will strengthen the commons in their communities.</p><p><strong>Upgrading supporting industries.</strong>&nbsp;Businesses rely on the local commons for a vibrant network of suppliers and other supporting actors. Many U.S. companies have long viewed suppliers the way the old Big Three automakers did — mainly as adversaries in price negotiations. Beaten down to thin margins, suppliers often failed to invest in knowledge and innovation and then lost out to offshore vendors. As suppliers atrophied, downstream firms declined or relocated.</p><strong>Upgrading supporting industries.</strong><p>Now sophisticated companies are finding innovative ways to upgrade their U.S. supplier networks. For example, firms such as John Deere (<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=DE\" target=\"_blank\">DE</a>), Caterpillar (<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=CAT\" target=\"_blank\">CAT</a>), and Harley-Davidson (<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=HOG\" target=\"_blank\">HOG</a>) offer in-person courses, online resources, dedicated staff, and joint projects that improve lean-manufacturing skills in their huge domestic supply bases.</p><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=DE\" target=\"_blank\">DE</a><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=CAT\" target=\"_blank\">CAT</a><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=HOG\" target=\"_blank\">HOG</a><p>Such programs bring lower costs and higher quality to the company, the suppliers, and downstream customers. The benefits also spill over to other U.S.-based businesses with access to those suppliers. Companies find huge advantages with excellent, nearby suppliers — low logistical costs, rapid problem solving, and easier joint innovation.</p><p><strong>Supporting innovation and entrepreneurship.</strong>&nbsp;Research shows that innovation accounts for a large fraction of growth in national productivity, and the knowledge gained by one firm frequently spills over to others. Entrepreneurship is also&nbsp;<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/gallery/news/companies/2012/10/11/40-under-40-jobs.fortune/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">key to job creation</a>: Startups account for 3% of U.S. employment but 20% of gross job creation.</p><strong>Supporting innovation and entrepreneurship.</strong><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/gallery/news/companies/2012/10/11/40-under-40-jobs.fortune/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">key to job creation</a><p>Intel (<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=INTC\" target=\"_blank\">INTC</a>) illustrates some of the ways a firm can boost conditions for innovation and entrepreneurship beyond its boundaries. It funds research at, and collaborates with, leading U.S. universities on technologies relevant to its business. It pools resources with other semiconductor leaders to conduct high-risk research as a member of Sematech. It has established programs on parallel computing with Microsoft (<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=MSFT\" target=\"_blank\">MSFT</a>) at UC Berkeley and the University of Illinois.</p><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=INTC\" target=\"_blank\">INTC</a><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=MSFT\" target=\"_blank\">MSFT</a><p>Intel also supports entrepreneurship through Intel Capital, which has invested over $10 billion in more than 1,200 IT-related new ventures, most in North America. And it has developed an online curriculum in entrepreneurship with UC Berkeley for undergraduates and master’s students and sponsors an annual business plan contest with $100,000 in prizes.</p><p>Such investments generate returns for Intel directly and when new ideas inform Intel’s own technology or boost demand for its products. In the process, entrepreneurship thrives in Intel’s communities.</p><p><strong>Bolstering regional strength.</strong>&nbsp;Working together, companies can dramatically improve a region’s business environment. Sometimes a cluster of related firms can upgrade capabilities in areas such as skill development, environmental responsibility, and export promotion.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hbr.org/product/envision-charlotte-building-an-energy-cluster/an/412073-PDF-ENG?Ntt=bill%2520george%2520charlotte%2520cluster\" target=\"_blank\">Our colleague Bill George</a>&nbsp;has highlighted the energy cluster in Charlotte, where major employers, city leaders, and nonprofits aim to make the city a hotbed of development for sustainable-energy technologies. Early efforts center on university curricula, skills training, and stimulating innovation by committing to reduce energy use in the city’s center by 20% in five years.</p><strong>Bolstering regional strength.</strong><a href=\"http://hbr.org/product/envision-charlotte-building-an-energy-cluster/an/412073-PDF-ENG?Ntt=bill%2520george%2520charlotte%2520cluster\" target=\"_blank\">Our colleague Bill George</a><p>In other cases, broader-based groups of firms can collaborate to improve factors that affect all businesses, such as public education, infrastructure, and small-business development. Kanter and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hbr.org/product/greater-minneapolis-st-paul-building-on-a-diversif/an/412074-PDF-ENG?Ntt=bill%2520george%2520itasca%2520project\" target=\"_blank\">George have written</a>&nbsp;about notable examples. For example, chief executives in Minneapolis/St. Paul have worked with Minnesota’s governor, mayors, and university leaders since 2004 to upgrade the region’s competitiveness. Their initiative, the Itasca Project, is improving education, transportation, connections between universities and business, and much else.</p><a href=\"http://hbr.org/product/greater-minneapolis-st-paul-building-on-a-diversif/an/412074-PDF-ENG?Ntt=bill%2520george%2520itasca%2520project\" target=\"_blank\">George have written</a><p><strong>Rein in self-interest</strong></p><strong>Rein in self-interest</strong><p>The third way business can and should improve U.S. competitiveness is by stopping self-interested actions that weaken the commons. Many such actions involve government relations and corporate lobbying. When firms seek special permits, tax breaks, or regulatory exceptions, they distort competition and raise regulatory complexity. Each plea seems profitable to the company or industry involved. But taken together, such pleas have created an exception-riddled corporate tax code, a rat’s nest of earmarks and subsidies in the federal budget, and delays in crucial legislation. Self-interested efforts by one company make others feel they must do the same. The overall cost and complexity of doing business rises. More important, in the long run, the resulting public cynicism erodes society’s support for business. Business should advocate policies that improve the U.S. business environment rather than pursue narrow self-interest, which often backfires.</p><p>We’re at a turning point for American business and for America. Our competitiveness is declining while&nbsp;<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/video/news/2012/09/17/n-occupy-wall-street.cnnmoney\" target=\"_blank\">trust in business erodes</a>. Those developments are not independent. With companies moving operations abroad as the business environment weakens, and reporting strong profits even as opportunities for Americans diminish, a dangerous dynamic emerges that shows itself in America’s dysfunctional political discourse. Trust in business declines, U.S. policies turn against business, companies leave America, and trust erodes further.</p><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/video/news/2012/09/17/n-occupy-wall-street.cnnmoney\" target=\"_blank\">trust in business erodes</a><p>Business has contributed to the problem by underrating the importance of the commons. In failing to revitalize their U.S-based operations and communities, companies are undermining their own opportunities for productivity and growth.</p><p>It’s time for business to lead in restoring U.S. competitiveness rather than wait for Washington. More and more companies are seizing opportunities to restore the commons in ways that power their own success. As business steps up to this broader role, it will turn the tide of cynicism that threatens the very core of America’s prosperity.</p><p><em>—<em>The ideas we present here have been shaped by our work with the core faculty team of HBS’s&nbsp;project on U.S. competitiveness: Mihir Desai, Bill George, Robin Greenwood, Rosabeth Moss&nbsp;Kanter, Tom Kochan, David Moss, Nitin Nohria, Gary Pisano, Bill Sahlman, David Scharfstein, Willy Shih, Dick Vietor, and Matt Weinzierl.

    "post_content": [
      "<p>By Leslie Kwoh &amp; Melissa Korn for Wall Street Journal, Published 9/26/2012</p><p>When General Electric Co. Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt tweeted for the first time this month, his “Hello Twitter” was greeted with some snarky replies, including this one: “@JeffImmelt how come my grandfather got on twitter before you?”&nbsp;</p><p> While arguably late to the game, Mr. Immelt’s debut on the microblogging site makes him a rarity among chief executives, who have generally steered clear of social media even as their companies have embraced it to commune with customers and pursue new business.&nbsp;</p><p> Chief executives are under pressure these days to appear accessible and “authentic,” but social media—with its demands for quick, unscripted updates that can quickly go viral—poses risks for top managers and the companies they represent, in the form of lawsuits, leaked trade secrets or angered customers.&nbsp;</p><p> Many corporate leaders say they are too busy running a company to spend time posting 140-character messages to Twitter, or retweeting posts from followers. What’s more, for some companies, the business case for using the site can seem unclear, with no direct correlation between Twitter followers and sales.&nbsp;</p><p> At least one leadership expert thinks those arguments are shortsighted. Most CEOs should accept that social media is part of their job description, says former Medtronic Inc. CEO Bill George, a management &nbsp;professor at Harvard Business School and avid tweeter. “People want CEOs who are real. They want to know what you think,” he says, adding: “Can you think of a more cost-effective way of getting to your customers and employees?”&nbsp;</p><p> Ocean Spray Cranberries Inc. is pushing CEO Randy Papadellis to start tweeting. But when Mr. Papadellis said in a recent interview that one of his first tweets would mention drinking cranberry juice before eating sushi to prevent food poisoning, his director of communications, Cindy Taccini, quickly nixed the plan, noting that the claim hadn’t been clinically proven.&nbsp;</p><p> Seven in 10 Fortune 500 CEOs have no presence on major social media networks such as Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Pinterest and Google+, according to a recent report by CEO.com and analytics company Domo.&nbsp;</p><p> Among those who do, 4% have known Twitter accounts and 8% use Facebook under their own names, according to the study, which was conducted in May. By contrast, 34% of all Americans are on Twitter and 50% use Facebook.&nbsp;</p><p> Corporate leaders such as Yahoo Inc.’s Marissa Mayer and Medtronic’s Omar Ishrak appear to have struck a balance on their Twitter accounts between personal and professional.&nbsp;</p><p> When she was tapped to head the struggling Internet company, Ms. Mayer, who is pregnant with her first child, rallied her troops and investors by posting photos of Yahoo-themed baby clothes on Facebook Inc’s Instagram photo-sharing site. More recently, on Twitter, she has talked up the company’s café.&nbsp;</p><p> But cautionary tales abound. In May, fashion retailer Francesca’s Holdings Corp. fired its chief financial officer, Gene Morphis, after he took to Facebook and Twitter with posts about earnings calls, snide remarks about short sellers and self-congratulatory comments after the company completed a secondary share offering. Mr. Morphis continues to tweet as @theoldcfo. On Monday, he tweeted about meeting with venture capitalists.&nbsp;</p><p> Mr. Morphis couldn’t be reached for comment.&nbsp;</p><p> Aetna Inc. AET CEO Mark Bertolini started his account three years ago—though his daughter, a former social-media director, tried to dissuade him. He has used the platform to share personal news, such as his son’s kidney transplant in June.&nbsp;</p><p> Though Mr. Bertolini started tweeting to communicate with friends, he became a lightning rod for critics of the big insurer, one of whom tweeted a wish that he would die of a stroke, or that his family would perish in a car crash. But he also has used the platform to show a different side of the insurer.&nbsp;</p><p> Last summer, when a colon-cancer patient tweeted about hitting the cost ceiling on his Aetna health plan, hundreds of Twitter users directed angry posts at Mr. Bertolini, who then reached out to the patient, also via Twitter. The result: Aetna agreed to cover the man’s medical bills through the end of his latest plan year.&nbsp;</p><p> “I don’t want to be a press release,” says Mr. Bertolini, who has about 3,000 followers. “You have to take some chances. You have to put yourself out there.”&nbsp;</p><p> Fortune 500 CEOs who do have Twitter accounts have an average of 33,250 followers, according to the study by CEO.com and Domo. A business celebrity such as former GE chief Jack Welch has 1.3 million followers.&nbsp;</p><p> News Corp. CEO Rupert Murdoch, who started tweeting in January, has amassed more than 326,000 followers. The media mogul has tweeted his opinions on issues such as gun control, public education and the euro crisis. News Corp. owns The Wall Street Journal.&nbsp;</p><p> Not all CEOs are as outspoken. Michael Dubyak, CEO of Wright Express Corp., which provides fuel charge cards to government agencies and corporations, says he considered tweeting but concluded there were simply too many pitfalls. Close friends and family can find him on Facebook, where Mr. Dubyak has an account, though it isn’t listed under his full name.&nbsp;</p><p> Many executives who tweet get a helping hand, either in the form of edits from their public-relations staff or ghostwritten posts. GE’s Mr. Immelt, for instance, has a team that works to “execute his vision” on Twitter, helping him draft tweets, according to company spokeswoman. The tweets are the result of a “discussion” between Mr. Immelt and Deirdre Latour, GE’s senior director of communications, but “it’s his tone and vision,” she says. GE’s legal team doesn’t review the posts before they are published.&nbsp;</p><p> CEOs who do mind their own accounts have to steer clear of bashing competitors, disparaging customers or opining on polarizing topics like religion and politics. When she trains executives on social media, Amy Jo Martin, CEO and founder of social-media agency Digital Royalty Inc., says clients are “fearful of sharing too much versus not sharing enough.” She advises executives to give followers a glimpse, not a guided tour, of their lives.&nbsp;</p><p> Some executives are already over it. Zappos Inc. CEO Tony Hsieh, an early adopter, hasn’t posted to his Twitter account since June.&nbsp;</p><p> In an email, he said the network is good for making announcements, but has lost its intimate, chatty feel. He has moved on to sharing photos on Instagram instead.</p>"

      "<p>Apple’s big win over Samsung for patent violations is monumental in the tech world. It has significant implications for American innovation that go far beyond the products in question. While patents have been a hot litigation topic for years, the outcome of this case sets a precedent for how future cases will be handled. The jury’s $1 billion award to Apple for damages, combined with the still-pending injunction decision, not only impacts the smart phone market, but is sending out powerful shock waves about copying popular designs with knock-offs.</p><p>The jury got this verdict right. Former I.B.M. executive Al Sabawi said Samsung deserved to lose because they were “lazy copycats … who think cutting and pasting is an intellectual achievement.” Patents protect research and development by providing both garage entrepreneurs and large corporations alike with an incentive to invest in innovation. Those who make the big investments in innovation and take big risks have the right to big rewards. Otherwise, investments in original ideas will eventually dry up and incremental improvements will be all we can expect. Business may find the status quo more attractive than the next frontier.</p><p>The jury’s decision has brought screams of protest from would-be innovators. Many of them think all existing designs are fair game to use as platforms to develop improved products. They hope to avoid the high cost and lead time of creating original designs as Apple has done throughout its history. That sounds good to entrepreneurs just starting companies who would like to build on the investments of the majors. But if copycats quell innovation, breakthrough innovations will cease.</p><p>I anticipate that IT companies will start to act more like pharmaceutical and medical technology companies in vigorously defending patent rights. They will become much more aggressive in claiming the full value for their inventions, either in the marketplace or through licensing agreements that will be increasingly costly.</p><p>This verdict also vindicated Steve Jobs and his work over the years for Apple. Jobs believed that a product’s look and feel is just as important as how it works.&nbsp; Let’s hope this type of verdict paves the way for the next generation of innovators to create and transform entire industries.</p><p>The Apple decision also has enormous implications for American competitiveness. The U.S. is far and away the most innovative country on earth and bears the brunt of the costs of research and new product development. This is our strongest competitive advantage in the global markets of the 21<sup>st</sup> century. If patents are enforced, U.S. inventors and investors will be incentivized to spend more heavily on R&amp;D, attract more creative people, and transform entire industries with yet-to-be-invented technology.</p><sup>st</sup><p>Consider the alternate scenario: If Apple had lost this case, it could have triggered hundreds of companies in Asia and elsewhere to copy its designs and sell them at far lower prices. In the short-run that may sound good for consumers, but the reality is that lack of intellectual property protection will destroy future investments in technology and innovation, and consumers will be the long-term losers.</p><p>Kudos to Apple for defending its IP rights and paving the way for others to do the same.</p><p><em>Footnote: </em>Many people are critical of Apple for outsourcing much of its production work to Asian subcontractors. The facts don’t bear out this criticism. Apple currently has 70,000 employees, of which 47,000 are based in the U.S. Since the recession hit in 2008, Apple has added 20,000 employees in the U.S. alone. Thus, for every job sent overseas, two jobs are created in the U.S. Not a bad ratio. Meanwhile, Apple reports that in a study by Analysis Group, it has created, directly or indirectly, 304,000 jobs in the U.S. Wouldn’t it be great if we could create dozens of other companies that take global leadership and become the job creators of this decade?

      "<p>From MWorld Summer 2012</p><p>Steve Jobs has become a symbol of innovative leadership. Sad to say, there aren’t many leaders like him. Most of them — Google’s Larry Page, Amazon’s Jeff Bezos, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Genentech’s Arthur Levinson, and Starbucks’ Howard Schultz — are entrepreneurs who founded and built their businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>These days virtually all large companies want to be innovative, yet they aren’t producing innovative leaders. What has happened to these leaders in large corporations? Have they been squeezed out by constant focus on producing short-term results and replaced by financially-oriented managers who respond to Wall Street’s demands for quarterly earnings? Or do corporate leaders lack the basic understanding of what is required to lead innovative organizations? While hundreds of books and articles have been produced on innovation, very little has been written on what is required to produce innovative leaders.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Research and Product Development Are Not Innovation</strong></p><strong>Research and Product Development Are Not Innovation</strong><p>In this era, many companies are investing heavily in research and product development, yet they fail to create innovative products and ideas. U.S. pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer and software companies like Microsoft illustrate that heavy spending on research and product development doesn’t necessarily yield innovations. In contrast, the breakthrough ideas that created Genentech, Google, and Facebook illustrate what can be done with limited budgets. It is important to recognize that research, product development, and innovation are radically different disciplines.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Research</em>&nbsp;is based on well-established scientific principles. At its best, research produces scientific breakthroughs that extend knowledge like Schottky’s invention of the transistor and Novartis’s breakthrough drug Gleevec for treating chronic myelogenous leukemia. <em>Product development, </em>on the other hand, follows established engineering principles to improve existing products.</p><em>Research</em><em>Product development, </em><p><em>Innovations </em>result from unique ways of looking at problems that produce original solutions. Another approach to innovation takes existing ideas and combines them into unique solutions. In retrospect, the outcome may seem obvious, yet is highly original. Apple’s iPad is an example, combining Apple’s iPod, iPhone, and iMac to create a breakthrough product.&nbsp;</p><em>Innovations </em><ol>\n<li>Because research and innovation require long time frames, the pressure on business-unit leaders to produce near-term success often results in funds being shifted from innovative projects to product development and product extensions.&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Large organizations that are heavily dependent on previous successes frequently squeeze out innovative ideas and the innovators who create them. Not infrequently, the most innovative ideas run into significant difficulties in their infancy and get killed or underfunded in favor of high-profitability development projects.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol><li>Because research and innovation require long time frames, the pressure on business-unit leaders to produce near-term success often results in funds being shifted from innovative projects to product development and product extensions.&nbsp;</li><li>Large organizations that are heavily dependent on previous successes frequently squeeze out innovative ideas and the innovators who create them.

The characteristics of great innovative leaders are dramatically different from traditional business managers. Here are five essential qualities they must have to lead innovation:&nbsp;</div><div>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Passion for innovation. </strong>Innovative leaders not only have to appreciate the benefits of innovation, they need a deep passion for innovations that benefit customers. Just approving funds for innovation is insufficient. Leaders must make innovation an essential part of the company’s culture and growth strategy.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>A long-term perspective. </strong>Most investors think three years is “long-term,” but that won’t yield genuine innovation. Major innovations can change entire markets as the iPod and iTunes did, but they take time to perfect products and gain adoption by mainstream users. Leaders cannot stop and start innovation projects as if they were marketing expenses; they must support innovation regardless of the company’s near-term prospects.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>The courage to fail and learn from failure. </strong>The risks of innovation are well known, but many leaders aren’t willing to be associated with its failures. However, there is a great deal to be learned from why an innovation has failed, as this enhanced understanding can lead to the greatest breakthroughs. At Medtronic, our failures with implantable defibrillators in the 1980s led to far more sophisticated approaches to treating heart disease in the 1990s.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Deep engagement with the innovators. </strong>Innovative leaders must be highly engaged with their innovation teams: asking questions, probing for potential problems, and looking for ways to accelerate projects and broaden their impact. That’s what HP’s founders Bill Hewlett and David Packard did by wandering around HP’s labs and challenging innovators.&nbsp;</li>\n<li><strong>Willingness to tolerate mavericks and defend them from middle management. </strong>The best innovators are rule-breakers and mavericks who don’t fit the corporate mold and are threatening to middle managers following more typical management approaches. That’s why innovative leaders must protect their maverick’s projects, budgets, and careers rather than forcing them into traditional management positions.&nbsp;</li>\n</ol>\n</div><ol>\n<li><strong>Passion for innovation. </strong>Innovative leaders not only have to appreciate the benefits of innovation, they need a deep passion for innovations that benefit customers.

They need to identify these emerging leaders and then give them their most challenging projects, while protecting them from failures and organizational conflicts.</p><p><strong>Some Examples of Innovative Companies</strong></p><strong>Some Examples of Innovative Companies</strong><p>When I joined Medtronic in 1989, it was evident that the innovation process had broken down. My first week, I was informed that all innovative ventures were being divested because they were losing money and the company needed improved short-term results. The company had many highly innovative people, who were demoralized by lack of senior management support. Engineering problems and product development overruns were absorbing all their funds. To solve both problems simultaneously, we created entirely separate organizations with different profit-and-loss structures and put disciplined leaders in charge of the established organization and innovative leaders in charge of breakthrough ideas.&nbsp;</p><p>To solve engineering problems, a highly disciplined engineer restructured the product development process. He cut new product lead times from 48 to 18 months with a rigorous approach that kept unproven ideas and innovation off the critical path. He selected disciplined engineers as project leaders and produced a steady stream of products resulting in near-term success. This provided the profits and cash flow to fund innovative ideas as well as refuel the product development process.&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, two very innovative senior executives led the creative side: a scientific leader and a medical doctor with a keen interest in technology and innovative medical ideas. They created a series of venture projects addressing unmet medical needs. Although many projects failed, enough succeeded to propel Medtronic to sustain a growth rate in excess of 18% for a 20-year period. This built the company from $400 million to $16 billion in revenue and gave Medtronic a reputation as “an innovation machine.” More important, innovations resulted in a dozen major medical breakthroughs to treat intractable disease, including original therapies for heart failure, spinal pain, cerebral palsy, and Parkinson’s disease.&nbsp;</p><p>Because the established business organization contained most of the people and budgets, I focused more attention as CEO on the innovators. This ensured their projects and their careers didn’t get crushed by the established organization that produced near-term profits. Since many of the innovations couldn’t withstand careful scrutiny at their outset, they had to be protected from engineering and financial analysis until they were sufficiently proven to put them through rigorous product design and clinical testing.&nbsp;</p><p>In recent decades the creators of America’s great growth corporations have been succeeded by established business leaders lacking the innovative drive to sustain growth. The stories of Hewlett-Packard and Amazon are particularly instructive. For 30 years, HP was the role model of innovation, producing 20% revenue growth and 20% operating profits. As it grew, HP became complacent and bureaucratic. In response, its board divested its original businesses and went outside four consecutive times to appoint commercially oriented CEOs, none of whom has restored the company’s innovative capacity.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos never wavered in his commitment to online retail marketing, even when the dot-com bubble burst in 2002 and Amazon’s stock declined more than 90%. More recently, Bezos ignored short-term profitability to expand into hardware with the Kindle. Faced with mounting costs and technical difficulties, Amazon’s financial chief asked him how much he was prepared to lose on this venture. Not flinching, Bezos replied, “How much money do we have?” He was so committed to this venture that he was prepared to stake the company’s future on its success. As a result, Amazon is transforming the book world from printed books to electronic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><strong>Conclusion</strong><p>For America to regain its global competitiveness, a new generation of innovative leaders needs to take over top roles in our leading corporations, not just found startup companies on the West Coast. This new generation seems to be emerging, led by IBM’s Sam Palmisano, Ford’s Alan Mulally, PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi, Lilly’s John Lechleiter, and General Mills’ Ken Powell. For America to regain its competitive edge, we will need many more like them.&nbsp;</p>"

      "<p>Nine years ago today the <em>New York Times </em>favorably reviewed <em>Authentic Leadership</em>, my first book. At the time “authenticity” in leadership was not a well-established idea. Many people asked, “What is an authentic leader?” although the concept seemed self-evident to me as being genuine, real and true to who you are. In those years authenticity has been popularized by Oprah Winfrey and others, as people search for the real thing.</p><em>New York Times </em><em>Authentic Leadership</em><p>With repeated leadership failures, many people today are eager to find authentic leaders, and the ideas have gradually become widely accepted, even among academics. More and more students are studying authentic leadership and striving to lead in this way. In spite of several well-publicized leadership failures, the new generation of corporate CEOs, many of whom I know personally, are highly authentic and doing an excellent job of leading, in spite of the economic headwinds. I find these trends very encouraging and feel that they bode well for the future of corporate leadership.</p><p>For those of you interested in <em>Authentic Leadership</em> and its successor, <em>True North</em>, here are two excellent blogs summarizing its ideas: <a href=\"http://bit.ly/P71wLS\" target=\"_blank\">http://bit.ly/P71wLS</a> <em>and</em><a href=\"http://bit.ly/NJ7z8x\" target=\"_blank\"> http://bit.ly/NJ7z8x</a>.

They focus mostly on the head and neglect the heart.</p><p>They emphasize hard skills and capabilities like knowledge, skills,&nbsp;and expertise. They assess intelligence, education, pedigree, experience,&nbsp;technical competence, skills, and other conventional indicators.</p><h3>The head is just part of the equation</h3><p>Of course, those factors are critical, and sometimes raw brainpower&nbsp;is especially important. Princeton’s president,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/president/biography/\">Shirley&nbsp;Tilghman</a>, told us, “<em>Brains really matter. You can’t be a leader here&nbsp;if you’re not smart.”</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.chevron.com/about/leadership/boardofdirectors/sugar/\">Ron Sugar</a>, former CEO and chairman of&nbsp;Northrop-Grumman (a global provider of military and commercial&nbsp;security systems), told us, “<em>A lot of our work is literally rocket science,&nbsp;so we have 45,000 outstanding scientists and engineers</em>.”</p><a href=\"http://www.princeton.edu/president/biography/\">Shirley&nbsp;Tilghman</a><em>Brains really matter.

It’s much easier to find people with the hard&nbsp;skills than it is to find the people with both the hard and soft skills.”</em></p><a href=\"http://www.pli.edu/Content/Faculty/Lynn_M_Easterling/_/N-1z13614Z4o?Ns=sort_title|0&amp;ID=PE571496\">Lynn Easterling</a><em>I can teach the hard skills, but I can’t teach good character or&nbsp;good relational skills. It’s much easier to find people with the hard&nbsp;skills than it is to find the people with both the hard and soft skills.”</em><p>The term “heart” is rich with meaning.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Palmer\">Parker Palmer</a>, a distinguished&nbsp;author and teacher, captured it well: “<em>I’m using the word ‘heart’ &nbsp;as they did in ancient times … It meant that center in the human self&nbsp;where everything comes together — where will and intellect and values&nbsp;and feeling and intuition and vision all converge. It meant the source of&nbsp;one’s integrity. It takes courage to lead from the heart.”</em></p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parker_Palmer\">Parker Palmer</a><em>I’m using the word ‘heart’ &nbsp;as they did in ancient times … It meant that center in the human self&nbsp;where everything comes together — where will and intellect and values&nbsp;and feeling and intuition and vision all converge. It meant the source of&nbsp;one’s integrity. It takes courage to lead from the heart.”</em><p>Heart includes intangibles such as character, will, passion, compassion,&nbsp;courage, and persistence. Heart encompasses what energizes&nbsp;people, what carries them through adversity, what drives them to win.</p><h3>Integrating the head and the heart</h3><p>Palmer observed that people are healthy and whole only when&nbsp;they involve both their head and heart.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.vailleadership.org/About/WhoWeAre.aspx\">The Vail Leadership Institute</a>&nbsp;espouses what it calls an “inside-first” leadership philosophy.&nbsp;According to its founder and president,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.vailleadership.org/About/OurPeople/BoardofTrustees.aspx#jhk\">John Horan-Kates</a>, “<em>This&nbsp;whole concept is built around the notion that leadership starts with&nbsp;one’s character, which largely resides in the heart, and emanates out&nbsp;from there.”</em></p><a href=\"http://www.vailleadership.org/About/WhoWeAre.aspx\">The Vail Leadership Institute</a><a href=\"http://www.vailleadership.org/About/OurPeople/BoardofTrustees.aspx#jhk\">John Horan-Kates</a><em>This&nbsp;whole concept is built around the notion that leadership starts with&nbsp;one’s character, which largely resides in the heart, and emanates out&nbsp;from there.”</em><p>Triple crown leadership integrates head and heart.&nbsp;In his bestselling book,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Authentic-Leadership-Rediscovering-Secrets-Creating/dp/0787969133\">Authentic Leadership</a></em>, author&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/about/\">Bill George</a>&nbsp;wrote that great companies must “<em>figure out how to tap into people’s hearts — their passions and their desires to make a difference&nbsp;through their work.”</em></p><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Authentic-Leadership-Rediscovering-Secrets-Creating/dp/0787969133\">Authentic Leadership</a></em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Authentic-Leadership-Rediscovering-Secrets-Creating/dp/0787969133\">Authentic Leadership</a><a href=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/about/\">Bill George</a><em>figure out how to tap into people’s hearts — their passions and their desires to make a difference&nbsp;through their work.”</em><p><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/fortune/1009/gallery.most_powerful_women.fortune/44.html\">Lorrie Norrington</a>, former president of eBay&nbsp;Marketplaces (the global division of eBay that manages its e-commerce&nbsp;sites), told us, “<em>The heart really matters in leadership. Without&nbsp;heart, it isn’t possible to create passion, dedication, and lasting change&nbsp;in your business.”</em></p><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2010/fortune/1009/gallery.most_powerful_women.fortune/44.html\">Lorrie Norrington</a><em>The heart really matters in leadership. Without&nbsp;heart, it isn’t possible to create passion, dedication, and lasting change&nbsp;in your business.”</em><h3>Heart reveals character within</h3><p>As we saw with Seabiscuit, heart reveals the character within.&nbsp;People with heart show a fierce commitment to their enterprise,&nbsp;demonstrating loyalty to their colleagues and passion for the group’s&nbsp;aims.</p><p>They show a healthy ambition to win and build something&nbsp;enduring and impactful. This fuels their performance and sustains&nbsp;them amid adversity. Football coach Vince Lombardi once said,&nbsp;“<em>Heart power is the strength of your company.”</em></p><em>Heart power is the strength of your company.”</em><p>Some leaders say this heart stuff is too soft and fluffy and not sufficiently&nbsp;actionable. We disagree.</p><p>Triple crown leadership proactively&nbsp;seeks, develops, and rewards people with both head and heart. It fills&nbsp;the enterprise with them, transforming both the people and the place&nbsp;in the process.</p><p><strong>Excerpted from&nbsp;</strong><em><strong><a href=\"http://triplecrownleadership.com/\">Triple Crown Leadership</a>&nbsp;– Building Excellent, Ethical and Enduring Organizations, by Bob Vanourek and Gregg Vanourek,&nbsp;</strong></em>© 2012, McGraw-Hill Professional.

But  executives weren’t speaking with one voice. </span></p><span>The Supreme Court decision largely upholding President Obama’s health  care overhaul was the talk of the business world Thursday. But  executives weren’t speaking with one voice. </span><p>Biotechnology  leaders hailed a provision creating an approval process for generic  versions of their medicines while also protecting the original drug  makers’ brands for a longer period. </p><p>But medical device  executives warned that a tax to help pay for the law will cost their  industry $29 billion over the coming decade, sapping funds for research  and hiring workers. </p><p>Health insurance companies in Massachusetts  said the high court ruling won’t dramatically change their marketplace  because many provisions of the federal law — including the requirement  that almost everyone buy insurance or pay a penalty — are already in  effect here. </p><p>“Our business will not be substantially affected,”  said Andrew Dreyfus, chief executive of Blue Cross Blue Shield of  Massachusetts, the state’s largest health insurer. </p><p>Nationally,  however, the law will draw more healthy people onto insurance rolls —  creating more customers — while also potentially boosting costs by  requiring insurers to cover people with preexisting conditions and  continue coverage when they get sick. </p><p>“This will make insurance  more expensive in other states,” said Philip J. Edmundson, chief  executive of William Gallagher Associates, the largest New England  insurance broker.&nbsp;</p><p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Employers, for their part, were bracing for new rules and insurance  pricing that could force them to spend more to ­offer health coverage  for workers.

But as with insurers, the impact will be less in  Massachusetts, where most of those rules are in place. </span><p>With the  requirement that other states form Massachusetts-style health insurance  exchanges covering all comers, some businesses might opt to “cash out”  employees, giving them money to buy insurance themselves rather than  providing health coverage, said <span style=\"background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-clip: border-box; background-origin: padding-box; background-size: auto; background-position: 0% 0%; background-repeat: repeat repeat;\">Regina E. Herzlinger</span>, a Harvard Business School professor specializing in health care. </p><span>Regina E. Herzlinger</span><p>“I’ve never heard a CEO say, ‘You know what I love about my job?

While he doesn’t like the medical-device tax,  which will cost his company an estimated $5 million a year, he said that  consideration was offset by the benefits flowing to medical technology  companies from an expanded base of insured customers.&nbsp;<br></p><br><p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">“You’re giving potentially 50 million Americans access to health care,”  Friel said. “So that will be positive for the industry because it  creates demand” for PerkinElmer’s diagnostic systems and related  products. </span></p><span>“You’re giving potentially 50 million Americans access to health care,”  Friel said. “So that will be positive for the industry because it  creates demand” for PerkinElmer’s diagnostic systems and related  products. </span><p>In the biotechnology sector, the clarity on health  care was also applauded — especially the “data exclusivity” provision  that will give companies a dozen years of protection before competitors  can introduce biosimilars — generic versions of biotech drugs. </p><p>“It’s  good news for the biotech industry,” said Richard Pops, chief executive  of Alkermes Inc. in Waltham. “This was a highly engineered and  negotiated law. If it had been struck down in whole or in part, it would  have created a lot of uncertainty.” </p><p>George Scangos, chief  executive of Biogen Idec Inc. in Weston, had a mixed reaction. “There  are aspects of the law that got it right, and there are aspects that  need work,” he said. “We want a set of policies that enable us to do  what we came to Biogen, and to biotech, to do: develop innovative  drugs.” </p><p>Scangos said the 12-year protection from generic  competition “strikes a nice balance between giving companies incentives  to develop new drugs and getting biosimilars onto the market that can  provide similar benefits at lower costs.”&nbsp;<br></p><br><p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">But he is wary of another piece of the act that creates a payment  advisory board charged with keeping health care cost increases below an  inflation target. The idea of a board may be well-meaning, he said, but  it’s “ill-conceived and will have unintended consequences.” </span></p><span>But he is wary of another piece of the act that creates a payment  advisory board charged with keeping health care cost increases below an  inflation target.

This is the law,  it’s constitutional, and it’s going to go forward.” </p><p>Harvard Business School professor <span style=\"background-image: none; background-attachment: scroll; background-clip: border-box; background-origin: padding-box; background-size: auto; background-position: 0% 0%; background-repeat: repeat repeat;\">Bill George</span>, a former chief executive of the medical device maker Medtronic Inc., said employers are obliged to help the overhaul succeed. </p><span>Bill George</span><p>“It’s  the law of the land,” he said. “We’ve had three and a half years of  politics; I believe it’s time to get on and make this health care law  work. The only way to make it work is to go upstream and make Americans  healthy. We have to work on fitness, we have to work on diet. Employers  need to take responsibility and give their employees financial  incentives to be healthy.”&nbsp;<br></p><br><p><span style=\"font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif;\">Some supporters of the 2006 Massachusetts health care overhaul said the  nation’s top court vindicated the state’s move to require near-universal  health coverage — and its insurance-buying mandate — even if costs  aren’t completely in check. </span></p><span>Some supporters of the 2006 Massachusetts health care overhaul said the  nation’s top court vindicated the state’s move to require near-universal  health coverage — and its insurance-buying mandate — even if costs  aren’t completely in check. </span><p>“This was a great victory for the  American people,” said James Roosevelt Jr., chief executive of Tufts  Health Plan. “The Supreme Court has reached a decision that provides  certainty for insurers and businesses and establishes the principle that  we’re already comfortable with in Massachusetts.” </p><p>But not  everyone was happy. Michael R. Minogue, chief executive of Abiomed Inc.,  a Danvers maker of heart pumps and artificial hearts, warned that the  medical device tax — which he believes should not have been included in  the law — would stifle innovation. </p><p>“The device tax, in our mind,  is really not part of health care reform,” he said. “It’s a policy  decision, and we think it’s bad policy because it’s going to have a  negative impact on jobs.”&nbsp;</p>"

      "<p>By Bill George for the <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/business/160046785.html\">Star Tribune</a>, published June 23, 2012.</p><a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/business/160046785.html\">Star Tribune</a><p>The tragic fall of Rajat Gupta, a man who helped so many organizations, is a vivid reminder of the frailties of human character. Convicted of insider trading, Gupta, who once headed global consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co., joins a lineup of failed leaders that includes ex-HP CEO Mark Hurd, investor Bernie Madoff, Berkshire’s David Sokol, ex-Best Buy CEO Brian Dunn, and Chesapeake Energy’s Aubrey McClendon.</p><p>Will the parade of leaders who fail to fulfill their leadership responsibilities ever end?</p><p>CEOs are public figures. Their actions are constantly being scrutinized inside and outside their organizations. For this reason their actions must be beyond reproach. The greatest failure for any leader is putting self-interest ahead of the organization’s interests, which is precisely what these leaders did.</p><p>A year ago, I wrote an article titled “Why Leaders Lose Their Way” that analyzed ways in which high-profile leaders get seduced. What I learned in researching that article is that leaders who focus on external gratification — money, fame and power — instead of inner satisfaction, tend to abandon their roots and lose their grounding. That makes them vulnerable to small unethical violations that gradually build into unfathomable actions.</p><p>In choosing leaders, people place their trust in them, believing they will always do their best to build the organization and ensure their organizations can navigate difficult times. Leaders who put their self-interests ahead of their organizations violate this most basic responsibility of leadership.</p><p>Why? It’s not because they don’t understand their responsibilities. Rather, too much credit is given to leaders, who are applauded when things go well as if they were one-person bands. Eventually, they start believing their press clippings.</p><p>As Novartis Chairman Daniel Vasella told Fortune magazine: “The idea of being a successful manager is an intoxicating one. It is a pattern of celebration leading to belief, leading to distortion. When you achieve good results, you are typically celebrated, and you begin to believe that the figure at the center of all that champagne-toasting is yourself.”</p><p>At this juncture, failed leaders start to believe they are above rules that govern others, and even above the law. Fueled by hubris, they violate the most basic principles, rationalizing that they won’t get caught. When confronted, they try to talk their way out of it, rather than admitting their mistakes. This only compounds their problems by creating a trail of distortions that eventually brings them down.</p><p>It’s easy to feel angry toward these leaders, but that misses the larger point. Violating the inherent trust their organizations place in them doesn’t just harm the leader, it hurts everyone associated with the organization as well as its reputation. Their actions cause employees, investors and customers to lose confidence in their organizations. It can even put their organizations in play. That’s what happened at Chesapeake Energy as Carl Icahn gained four board seats in a proxy contest. Best Buy could be next, due to Brian Dunn’s misconduct and former Chairman Richard Schulze’s failure to address it.</p><p>Gupta’s actions tarnished the reputations of many organizations, among them McKinsey, Goldman Sachs, and Procter &amp; Gamble. In the case of HP’s Hurd, his termination left the company without a CEO or a viable strategy, leading to a decline in HP’s market valuation of $60 billion, or 55 percent.</p><p>Each of us is fallible. To minimize the likelihood of leaders losing their way, it is essential to screen them carefully for their values and character. Leaders should be recognized for who they are, not just what they are, as character takes precedence over their résumés. Authentic leadership development opportunities enable them to integrate their life stories and crucibles into their thinking and understand their weaknesses, shortcomings and failures as well as their strengths. Ultimately, great leaders must be comfortable with their vulnerabilities. This requires years of careful preparation to ensure they are ready for the responsibilities of leadership.</p><p>Perhaps because of these well-publicized leadership failures, there has been a marked shift in recent years from hiring external candidates to the promotion of insiders whose character and values have been carefully tested. Recently-appointed CEOs seem to have a deep understanding of their personal responsibilities and the importance of staying grounded as leaders and human beings.</p><p><em>Bill George is professor of management practice at Harvard Business School, author of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">True North</span>, and former chair and CEO of Medtronic, Inc.</em></p><em>Bill George is professor of management practice at Harvard Business School, author of <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">True North</span>, and former chair and CEO of Medtronic, Inc.</em><span>True North</span><div></div>"

      "<p>In my 2009 book, <em><a title=\"7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Lessons-Leading-Crisis-Warren-Bennis/dp/0470531878/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1250044420&amp;sr=8-3\" target=\"_blank\">7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis</a></em>, the first lesson when encountering a crisis is to “face reality, starting with yourself.” This week we have contrasting examples of leaders confronting crises who took sharply different paths: JP Morgan’s Jamie Dimon and Best Buy’s Richard Schultz.</p><em><a title=\"7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Lessons-Leading-Crisis-Warren-Bennis/dp/0470531878/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1250044420&amp;sr=8-3\" target=\"_blank\">7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis</a></em><a title=\"7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis\" href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Lessons-Leading-Crisis-Warren-Bennis/dp/0470531878/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1250044420&amp;sr=8-3\" target=\"_blank\">7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis</a><p>Schultz founded Best Buy in 1966 with a single store called “Sound of Music.” He has built his company into an international chain with 1,250 stores, 170,000 employees, and $50 billion in revenues. Although he twice turned the CEO role over to long-standing colleagues, Brad Anderson in 2002 and Brian Dunn in 2009, he never relinquished control.&nbsp; As Best Buy’s board chair, Schultz dominated both the board and the company, with few board members or executives who dared challenge his power.</p><p>Without question, Schultz is a brilliant entrepreneur who built a great organization. He was named one of the Twin Cities top five executives of the decade in the 1990s. In 2004 Best Buy was named “company of the year” by <em>Forbes</em> magazine.&nbsp; He amassed a personal fortune, retained 20 percent of Best Buy’s voting shares, and endowed the Schultz School of Entrepreneurship at St. Thomas University.</p><em>Forbes</em><p>In the last three years Best Buy’s model of selling all forms of electronic hardware has lost ground to on-line retailers like Amazon, and its sales have slipped. Schultz and Dunn have been slow to react, resisted making fundamental changes in Best Buy’s business model. Last December Schultz got some very disturbing news from a reliable source in the company: CEO Dunn was having “an extremely close personal relationship” in Best Buy’s headquarters with a 29-year-old female employee. Schultz confronted Dunn with the allegations, which he denied.</p><p>What did Schultz do next? Nothing. He buried the issue, not mentioning it to Best Buy’s board, its general counsel or head of human resources. Nor did he launch an internal investigation to see whether the allegations were true. Not surprisingly, the issue surfaced again in March, this time directly to members of the board. The board took immediate action, terminating Dunn that day and hiring two experienced investigators, William McLucas and Tom Strickland, to determine the veracity of the charges. Their report led to Schultz’s forced resignation as board chair on May 14 and caused further turmoil at the company.</p><p>The lesson: Schultz failed to face reality and acknowledge his role in supporting, and perhaps dominating, CEO Dunn. As a result, he was forced to resign in disgrace, a sad end to a brilliant career.</p><p>In contrast, Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan, upon learning of the firm’s $2 billion loss in a hedging transaction, took full responsibility for the problems. He didn’t hide from the media, as he talked openly about what happened. He went on <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Meet the Press</span> the next day, telling David Gregory, “We made a terrible egregious mistake. We were stupid. There’s almost no excuse for it.” The following day he accepted the resignation of the trader responsible for the losses. He acknowledged that the losses came at an extremely awkward time in the finalization of the regulation of the Dodd-Frank law in defining proprietary trades and hedging, but didn’t blame others.</p><span>Meet the Press</span><p>The lesson: While the losses at JP Morgan are not insignificant, they represent less than 10 percent of the firm’s annual profits and can be absorbed without basic harm to the bank. While the crisis was front-page news for the past week and has triggered several investigations, Dimon will be able to put it behind him in due course and continue to build his bank. All because he faced reality and took full responsibility for the problems.</p><div></div>"

      "<p><em>Originally posted in Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN) on January 31, 1999</em></p><em>Originally posted in Star Tribune (Minneapolis, MN) on January 31, 1999</em><p>Bill George has turned Medtronic into a medical powerhouse and Minnesota’s most valuable public company, but he has learned that the most valuable things can’t be measured by sixteenths of a point.</p><p>Employees of Medtronic Inc. won’t soon forget the unusual e-mail message they received from Chief Executive Bill George around Thanksgiving 1996.</p><p>What might have been a forum for an update on productivity instead was a deeply personal message about an illness in the George family.</p><p>Penny George’s breast cancer was diagnosed in February 1996, and she had a mastectomy and underwent seven months of chemotherapy. Bill George not only let his 14,000 co-workers know that his wife was recovering from the ordeal, but also took the occasion to explain how the experience had “transformed” the couple, teaching them to “live more in the moment.”</p><p>As George explained in a recent interview, “It’s important for people to know their leader is vulnerable. It makes the company more human and real. Medtronic has never been a place that you go to just work.”</p><p>They don’t teach that kind of leadership at George’s alma mater, Harvard Business School, but it’s hard to argue with the results, which extend beyond the scores who have made fortunes in Medtronic stock to the community at large.</p><p>Under George, who became CEO in 1991, Medtronic this year became Minnesota’s most valuable publicly traded company, eclipsing Maplewood-based 3M Co. The growth is bringing a surge of new, high-paying jobs to the Twin Cities area in such fields as computer software engineering and manufacturing. Through internal growth and a series of acquisitions engineered by George, Medtronic expects to double its payroll in Minnesota between 1998 and 2003 to 8,000.</p><p>Medtronic sales have soared from $1 billion to a projected $5 billion by 2000. In the same period, the company known worldwide for pacemakers has been reinventing itself as a provider of diverse medical technologies. Medtronic got 70 percent of its sales from pacemakers in 1991. By April 2000, Medtronic will get only a quarter of its sales from pacemakers, the rest coming from an array of implanted devices treating everything from Parkinson’s disease to degenerative back problems.</p><p>Meanwhile, longtime employees and investors have seen Medtronic’s stock increase more than tenfold during George’s tenure, quadrupling the returns of the Standard &amp; Poor’s stock index. Medtronic is now the state’s most valuable publicly traded company, with a market capitalization (stock multiplied by share price) of about $35 billion, compared with about $30 billion for 3M.</p><p>George, 56, and his family have put some of their wealth back to work in Minneapolis with a $1 million stock gift in 1997 to the United Way and the establishment of a $15 million family foundation.</p><p>But Medtronic has meant more to George than a ticket to wealth. Once known as a Pentagon wonk or the intimidating wunderkind at Litton, George has been changed by Medtronic even as he has helped it change.</p><p>“It’s softened me in a way,” George said, citing the company’s focus on enhancing and saving lives and its spirit of cooperation.</p><p>George’s longtime friend Tad Piper, head of U.S. Bancorp’s Piper Jaffray subsidiary, says George has evolved from “self-focused to outwardly focused, for himself and the company. He’s thrilled to be with a company that makes a difference for people.”</p><p>Company founder Earl Bakken, who developed the first battery-powered pacemaker in the late ’50s, chuckles when he thinks of founders who have had to return to their companies after successors failed. Bakken has been spending most of his time in Hawaii since 1989, developing a new kind of hospital that combines high-tech medicine with complementary treatments such as massage and herbal therapy.</p><p>“As a leader, [George] is doing better than I could have ever done,” Bakken said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>A community leader</h3><p>George’s 1997 chairmanship of the United Way campaign for the Minneapolis area marked something of a turning point for the charity.</p><p>Until then, no one had given more than $50,000 to the United Way of Minneapolis Area.</p><p>Bill and Penny George gave $1 million, as did Medtronic Vice Chairman Glen Nelson and his wife, Marilyn Carlson Nelson, CEO of the Carlson Companies. Since then, eight other couples have given $1 million or more.</p><p>The Georges also are part of a local group whose members pledge 1 percent of their net worths to charity each year. That’s a considerable sum – George’s Medtronic stock holdings alone are approaching $100 million.</p><p>Joe Selvaggio, coordinator of the One Percent Club in the Twin Cities and a fund-raiser for Minneapolis’ Project for Pride in Living, a nonprofit group that focuses on housing and jobs, says he’s thankful for “balanced” executives such as George.</p><p>“It’s thrilling to me to see that all CEOs haven’t gone the way of Bill Gates who [was quoted as saying] he couldn’t go to church with his wife because it wasn’t an efficient use of time,” Selvaggio said. “Bill George is balanced.”</p><p>George gives a simple explanation for his commitment to local charity.</p><p>“We had $10,000 to our names when we came to Minneapolis in 1970,” George said. “Everything we’ve earned has been in this community. We want to leave a legacy and do good.”</p><p>The family foundation started by the Georges concentrates on youth development, scholarships and health care programs such as the Virginia Piper Cancer Institute.</p><p>George has invested some of his money into a more personal passion – soccer. He has owned part of the Minnesota Thunder professional soccer team since 1994. His love for the game started when his sons were in youth leagues. He coached for 13 years in south Minneapolis, where he still lives, and said he found the hobby “tremendously satisfying.”</p><p>George himself was a not-so-intimidating 105-pound linebacker in his school days. His best sport was tennis, which he played as a college undergraduate and still pursues, along with hiking and downhill skiing.</p><p>He soon will have more time to pursue those activities. He will step down as CEO in early 2001, seven years before mandatory retirement at 65. “Ten years is enough,” George said. “I said in 1991 I didn’t want to become enamored of the job.”</p><p>He intends to recommend that the board of directors make Medtronic President Art Collins, a former Abbott Labs executive, the next CEO.</p><p>“Art is an exceptional leader,” George said, “and very, very wise about how business works.”</p><p>George says he might stay on as chairman for a time during the transition or go off immediately to teach or write a book. Possible topics? Values and ethics in an organization, and how to build a high-tech company and sustain its growth.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Carrying the mantle</h3><p>George remembers being programmed for business success. His father, a civil engineering consultant in Michigan, expected great things of his only child.</p><p>“He had had a number of disappointments” in his business career, George said, such as not making partner in the consulting firm Booz Allen, and being ousted from his job as president of another company when the major shareholder sold out.</p><p>“My mother didn’t care if I got A’s or C’s,” George said. “I think my father felt like he never realized his career potential, and he was looking for me to do many of the things he had been unable to do in his career. I was given the mantle, or the burden, of doing those things.”</p><p>George’s mother died in 1966, when George was 24; his father died six years ago, at 93, about a year after his son was named CEO of Medtronic.<br>“He certainly gave [me] more credit than I deserved” for career accomplishments, George said of his father.</p><br><p>Even so, George said, he’s tried not to push his own sons. “Because we’ve been successful in our careers, by definition that puts a lot of pressure on them,” he said.</p><p>Jon George, 22, just graduated from Amherst College in Massachusetts and is considering becoming a doctor; Jeff George, 25, is in graduate school for advanced international studies at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. He wants to be involved in venture capital investing in Asia and Africa.</p><p>George’s college career included graduation with honors from Georgia Tech, where he got a degree in industrial engineering.</p><p>In 1966, after Harvard Business School, he took a job in the Pentagon. In his three years there, he was special assistant to the secretary of the Navy and an assistant to the comptroller of the Defense Department.</p><p>He soon learned it was not Camelot.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Disillusioned with war</h3><p>“When I went I was fairly idealistic,” George said. “I think a lot of people were attracted to Robert McNamara and the Pentagon. I thought I could do something, but I got disillusioned with the war in about 30 days and spent the rest of the time trying to find ways to help get us out of it.”</p><p>After three years of grappling with cost overruns on weapons systems and other seemingly intractable problems, George was ready for the private sector.</p><p>In 1970, he arrived in Minneapolis as a manager for the Litton microwave business. By 1973, he was president of the subsidiary. Over seven years, George helped to take the new business from $10 million in annual sales to $200 million. He was still in his 30s.</p><p>David Cox, former CEO of Cowles Media, worked for five years at the microwave business as a vice president and general manager and vividly recalls meeting George, who was five years younger and still has something of a Richie Cunningham look about him.</p><p>“My first impression was that I can’t work for this kid,” Cox said, “but after about five minutes I could see he was an extraordinary businessperson.”</p><p>“By any measure of intelligence, he is a genius,” Cox said. “He has a photographic memory. He can look at a page of text and he has it.</p><p>“His intensity may have intimidated some people, but he didn’t use it as a tactic or anything. It was hard for other people to catch up. It’s like looking in a crystal ball. For some some people the ball is sort of cloudy, and they can’t see the whole picture, while for Bill [the view] was absolutely clear.”</p><p>Much of George’s managerial education occurred at Minneapolis-based Honeywell, where he worked for about 11 years after leaving Litton. After joining as a vice president of corporate development, George ran Honeywell Europe and later became president of industrial automation and then president of Honeywell’s space and aviation businesses. He was best known for uncovering huge cost overruns in government contracts that came with the 1986 acquisition of Sperry aerospace.</p><p>Regarded as a candidate to run the entire company, George was responsible for Honeywell businesses with $2 billion in annual sales when he met Medtronic founder Bakken in Phoenix to talk about the No. 2 position at a company with $750 million in annual sales – about a tenth the size of Honeywell then.</p><p>Analysts were surprised when George accepted the position in 1989. Bakken wasn’t.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Embracing the mission</h3><p>For the driven, career-minded George, the move was a rational shot at becoming a CEO more quickly than he could at Honeywell, and at a company with promising growth prospects. For George, the man in search of spiritual meaning, the lure was in the guiding principles laid down by Bakken decades earlier.</p><p>Among the points of Medtronic’s mission statement was that it should “contribute to human welfare . . . strive to alleviate pain, restore health and extend life.”</p><p>“As I understand it, he took [the mission] home to his wife and his two boys,” Bakken said. “They are a very Christian family, and I believe when he considered the role of maybe leading Medtronic, it might have fit more with his moral standards.”</p><p>The move coincided with the beginning of George’s own transition to a more relaxed, patient and collaborative management style, a change some attribute to the influence of Penny George, whose work as an industrial psychologist is to examine relationships in the workplace.</p><p>“He and Penny have a very tender relationship,” said Gordon Sprenger, executive officer of Allina Health System, a Minnetonka health care company, and a Medtronic board member who has known the Georges for a dozen years. “He’s very thoughtful and supportive of her and her career.</p><p>“As his responsibilities have grown, he has more and more recognized the need to get diversity of options as he makes tough decisions,” Sprenger said.</p><p>One of the devices George uses to improve his decision-making and people skills and deal with stress is transcendental meditation. He took it up in 1975, after taking a class at the University of Minnesota, and unlike many others who experimented with it in the ’70s, he’s still at it, spending 20 minutes at home before breakfast and another 20 minutes at night before dinner.</p><p>“It’s really important for anyone who makes a lot of decisions to get away to reflect, to get your mind totally off of work. You need that perspective,” he said.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Religion is important</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A regular at Plymouth Congregational Church in Minneapolis, George is one of seven or eight men, primarily executives, who have held weekly Bible study and personal exploration meetings since 1975. George and his wife also participate in a discussion group for “spiritually oriented couples” that Piper and his wife have also attended for more than 20 years.</p><p>George draws a distinction between spirituality and religion.</p><p>He sees religion as “personal.” Spirituality he defines as commitment to making a contribution to society, something that “brings life to workplace.”</p><p>“In both cases,” George says, “it’s about how you relate to other people and the whole concept of service.”</p><p>Both religion and spirituality have been part of his life for “as long as I can remember,” George said, but it has been in recent years that he’s “seen more clearly how to serve and give back.”</p><p>“He wants to be a contributor to the greater good, in the greatest sense of good,” Piper said of George.</p><p>George’s colleagues feel the same way, based on Fortune magazine’s recent list of the 100 best companies to work for in America. Medtronic was 67th in the survey, in large part because employees felt a sense of mission and humanity there. The stock grants of 2.5 to 4 percent of pay each year help, too.</p><p>Sprenger, of Allina, said George inherited a company with a soul and solid finances, thanks to the turnaround work of his predecessor, Win Wallin, but one with a narrow focus.</p><p>George provided the vision of what the company could become and a knack for building systems and efficiency. After years of laying the groundwork for a bigger organization, Medtronic surprised observers with its $8 billion in acquisitions last year.</p><p>(The company announced Friday the elimination of 1,600 jobs at one of its newly acquired divisions, but they primarily are in California, and there will be no effect on Medtronic’s growth plans in Minnesota.)</p><p>“Bill came in with training in larger, more complex organizations,” said Art Collins, Medtronic’s president. “Medtronic really hadn’t had an executive with that kind of global experience.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Value of small events</h3><p>Still, the small events have sometimes played as big a part in George’s thinking as the larger trends. In his first year, 1989, George remembers meeting T.J. Flack.<br>Flack was one of six patients who, with their doctors, attended the company’s annual holiday party, a highlight for all employees. “We get to see what we were working for all year,” George said.</p><br><p>Flack, 18 at the time, was born with cerebral palsy, and the condition made it difficult for him to move. But his health had improved dramatically because of an implanted Medtronic drug pump.</p><p>Flack made an impression on George. The company had been considering phasing out the drug pump line and other neurology businesses, which together accounted for $10 million in sales then.</p><p>“One of the reasons we came here was to `restore health and life,’ ” George said. “There were a lot of terrible diseases we could address, like cerebral palsy, and we decided to keep the program.”</p><p>Medtronic would later funnel money from a pacemaker patent suit into neurological devices. Neurology is now a $1 billion business for Medtronic, and drug pumps are the fastest-growing line in the company, George said.</p><p>When illness struck his wife a few years later, it served as reinforcement for George – and ultimately Medtronic employees – about what’s important, both in life and their work.</p><p>“It certainly makes you appreciate life every day,” George said.</p><p>1/3 William W.

      "<p><em>Originally published in the <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/business/147321015.html\" target=\"_blank\">Star Tribune</a></em></p><em>Originally published in the <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/business/147321015.html\" target=\"_blank\">Star Tribune</a></em><a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/business/147321015.html\" target=\"_blank\">Star Tribune</a><p>In recent weeks three of the Twin Cities’ greatest business and civic leaders — all part of Tom Brokaw’s “Greatest Generation” — have passed from the scene. This trio includes Edson Spencer, who built Honeywell into a great global corporation; John Cowles, leader of Cowles Media and the Star Tribune, and John Morrison, who led Norwest Corp. (now Wells Fargo) into the modern banking era. Their deaths are solemn reminders that great leaders need to be succeeded by new generations of leaders equally committed to building the Twin Cities.</p><p>These corporate leaders believed not only in building their companies but recognized a vibrant, healthy Twin Cities community was essential for creating vital organizations.</p><p>Although their pursuits were different, their beliefs were similar:</p><p><strong>Military service&nbsp;</strong>— They believed in serving their country. Spencer served in the U.S. Navy during World War II, while Morrison left Yale in his junior year to fly C-46s from Burma to China in the Army Air Corps. Cowles was too young for WWII, but served the U.S. Army during the Korean War.</p><strong>Military service&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>Long-term view</strong>&nbsp;— They built great businesses focused on the long-term. A Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, Spencer transformed Honeywell from a domestic company that exported into a global powerhouse in control systems and computers. From 1959-1964 he led Honeywell Asia, including Yamatake-Honeywell, its Japanese joint venture. Returning to Minnesota, he was Honeywell’s chairman and CEO from 1973-1987. Morrison spent 28 years with Honeywell, rising to chief financial officer. After retiring from Honeywell, he restored a foundering Northwestern Bank and later Norwest Bancorporation, paving the way for today’s modern Wells Fargo. Cowles expanded his family’s newspaper business from the Star Tribune and Des Moines Register into magazines and other media outlets. All three focused on their future visions, moving their companies into new fields ahead of emerging trends.</p><strong>Long-term view</strong><p><strong>Quality of life</strong>&nbsp;— They created lasting community institutions enhancing our quality of life. Cowles helped create the Guthrie Theater in 1963, and 40 years later helped lead its revival at its stunning Mississippi River home. In the 1970s he was a prime mover behind the Metrodome to ensure top professional sports teams in the Twin Cities. Spencer was a leading force among business leaders who created the Minnesota Business Partnership and Center for Corporate Responsibility, and he initiated Honeywell’s housing project in south Minneapolis. He chaired the boards of the Ford Foundation, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Carleton College and Mayo Clinic. Morrison set the standard for local banks as prime movers in community initiatives and served as a director of General Mills, Northwestern National Life and Macalester College.</p><strong>Quality of life</strong><p><strong>Role models</strong>&nbsp;— They served as role models and mentors to the next generation of leaders. Personally, all three reached out to get me engaged in the business and civic communities, as they did other emerging leaders. While I was president of rapidly growing Litton Microwave, Spencer came to visit and later asked me to join Honeywell, offering me the opportunity to be president of Honeywell Europe. Ed was an inspiring and thoughtful boss, mentor and a towering global business leader.</p><strong>Role models</strong><p>In 1978 Morrison asked me to serve on Northwestern Bank’s board of directors, where I learned the vital role local banks play in community-building, a tradition continued by today’s local banking leaders. Joining the Guthrie board in the mid-1970s, I was inspired by John Cowles’s abiding commitment to the vision of building the nation’s leading classical theater. He remained an active and thoughtful member of the Guthrie board until the end of his days.</p><p>In knowing these leaders along with contemporaries Kenneth and Bruce Dayton, Winston Wallin and Bobby Piper, I am moved by their unwavering commitment to building this community and their reaching out to younger leaders in order to ensure its future vitality. The torch has now been passed to leaders like U.S. Bancorp’s Richard Davis, General Mills’ Ken Powell, Cargill’s Greg Page, Ecolab’s Doug Baker, and Target’s Gregg Steinhafel along with foreign-born leaders Inge Thulin of 3M, Medtronic’s Omar Ishrak and Carlson’s Hubert Joly.</p><p>They are focusing on creating jobs, improving workforce education, and enabling the arts and professional sports to flourish while building sophisticated global businesses. Just as the Greatest Generation did, it is equally important that they reach out to emerging leaders in their 20s and 30s who will become the business and community leaders of the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><address></address>"

Such skills, they argue, are crucial for those hoping to succeed in an increasingly frenetic environment where distractions from an always-buzzing phone to pressure for strong quarterly profit reports constantly impinge on decisions.</p><p>While the idea of mindfulness originates in the serious practice of meditation, B-school faculty say it has many applications for executives who aren’t looking for a spiritual fix but simply want to clear their heads and become aware of reflexive, emotional reactions that can lead to bad decisions.</p><p>And it isn’t just individuals that can be mindful, they say. Donde Ashmos Plowman, dean of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln College of Business Administration, has examined the mindfulness of organizations, a concept described previously by Karl Weick, at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business.</p><p>Mindful organizations are those that pay close attention to what is happening within them, are ready to correct mistakes rather than punishing workers who report them and respond quickly to changes or problems, Ms. Plowman said.</p><p>She and several colleagues tried to quantify the mindfulness of 180 different business schools, asking deans and other administrators to complete questionnaires. Critics have accused business schools of culpability in the many high-profile lapses of corporate ethics in recent years, and Dean Plowman said studying the schools’ mindfulness could indicate whether they are capable of self-correction.</p><p>One thing the researchers noticed, Dean Plowman said, was that deans rated their schools’ mindfulness more highly than did those working for them.</p><p>“It’s easy for people at the head of an organization to end up in a bubble,” she said. “That really alerted me to say, ‘What do I need to do as a dean to improve the way we communicate?'”<br>Others apply mindfulness at a more individual level.</p><br><p>At IMD business school in Lausanne, Switzerland, leadership professor Ben Bryant introduces his executive-education students to techniques for concentrating on their breathing and becoming aware of sounds and sensations, which he says can help them center themselves at the office or in a business meeting.</p><p>“Hard-core meditators are horrified that this word is being used in business,” he said. “They think meditation was never meant to be instrumental in making money.”</p><p>Nonetheless, Mr. Bryant feels it is worthwhile to help those running companies to slow down and think about how best to direct their attention. Especially for CEOs, “it’s the smallest things that they do that have huge ripple effects,” he said. “Because their lives are so busy and so loaded up with things, they miss too many opportunities to make either themselves or their organizations different.”</p><p>Jeremy Hunter, who teaches at the Peter F. Drucker and Masatoshi Ito Graduate School of Management at Claremont Graduate University outside Los Angeles, believes mindfulness should be at the center of business schools’ teaching. That, he argues, is because it is about improving the quality of attention, and in the modern workplace, attention is the key to productivity.<br>“To me, it’s fundamental to how work gets done these days,” he said. “Basically, that’s what work is, attention.”</p><br><p>In a series of four seven-week executive-education classes, and a separate course for M.B.A. students, Mr. Hunter teaches what he calls self-management, “managing your insides so you can deal with your outsides better.” He often starts class with a brief meditation, and covers topics like managing emotional reactions and dealing with change.</p><p>“One of the powers of being at a business school is that you reach an audience that would never show up at a meditation fair” but can recognize the techniques’ usefulness, he said.<br>After a conversation about multitasking, one student became frustrated with a weekly work meeting where staff were more focused on their cellphones than the discussion, Mr. Hunter said. When he returned to the office and insisted that everyone put their phones in a box before starting, his colleagues initially responded with irritation, but the weekly gathering soon became so much more efficient that it was cut from to an hour from 90 minutes, Mr. Hunter said.</p><br><p>At Harvard Business School, leadership professor William George focuses on helping businesspeople to better understand their emotions. He ran a two-day conference in 2010 on mindful leadership with a Tibetan Buddhist meditation master, and has meditated regularly since 1975.</p><p>In his executive-education class on leadership development, he instructs students who include CEOs to open up to others about their toughest experiences.</p><p>Such conversations can increase self-awareness, which Professor George sees as central to good leadership. It isn’t a lack of intelligence that causes executives to make poor decisions, but a lack of awareness of the feelings that drive their reactions, he said.</p><p>“It’s the inability to admit your own mistakes, or your fear of failure, your fear of rejection, your desire to be seen as Mr. Perfect, or Ms. Perfect in front of groups, that’s what leads to failure,” he said. “It’s amazing to me how executives in their 40s or 50s who are running giant enterprises can get really into this.”</p>"

      "<p>This set of four articles were all initially published in Harvard Business Review.</p><h1>New Era for Global Leadership Development</h1><p>The realities of globalization, with increasing emphasis on emerging markets, present corporate leaders with enormous challenges in developing the leaders required to run global organizations. Too many multinational companies — particularly Japanese, Indian, German, and some American ones — still concentrate vital decisions in the hands of a small group of trusted leaders from their home country. They hire technical specialists, local experts, and country managers from emerging markets but rarely promote them to corporate positions. Instead, they groom future global leaders from the headquarters nation by sending them on overseas appointments.</p><p>This approach worked relatively well for companies selling standard products in developed markets, but as multinationals transition into truly global organizations relying on emerging markets for growth, it’s far from adequate. In order to adapt to local cultures and market needs, companies must shift to decentralized, collaborative decision-making. That requires developing many leaders capable of working anywhere.</p><p>To address these needs, new approaches for developing global leaders are required:</p><ul>\n<li>The diversity of top leadership should reflect the diversity of the firm’s customers.</li>\n<li>Global leaders must be effective in aligning employees around the company’s mission and values, empowering people to lead, and collaborating horizontally rather than managing vertically.</li>\n<li>Rather than concentrating on the on the top 50 leaders, global companies need to develop hundreds, even thousands, of leaders comfortable operating in a variety of cultures.</li>\n<li>Developing global leaders with cultural sensitivities and collaborative skills requires greater focus on emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and empowerment than on traditional management skills.</li>\n</ul><li>The diversity of top leadership should reflect the diversity of the firm’s customers.</li><li>Global leaders must be effective in aligning employees around the company’s mission and values, empowering people to lead, and collaborating horizontally rather than managing vertically.</li><li>Rather than concentrating on the on the top 50 leaders, global companies need to develop hundreds, even thousands, of leaders comfortable operating in a variety of cultures.</li><li>Developing global leaders with cultural sensitivities and collaborative skills requires greater focus on emotional intelligence, self-awareness, and empowerment than on traditional management skills.</li><p>To understand these approaches, let’s examine what leading global companies are doing:</p><p>Create diversity among senior leadership.&nbsp;To make sound decisions, companies need a diverse set of leaders who have deep understanding of their local customers, especially those in emerging markets. Opportunities at the highest levels, including C-suite and CEO, must be open to people of all national origins. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola is a pioneer in geographic diversity. As early as the 1960s, the company was run by South African Paul Austin. Since that time, Coca-Cola has had Cuban, Australian, and Irish CEOs, leading to today’s CEO, Turkish-American Muhtar Kent.</p><p>Over the past decade two Swiss companies, Nestle and Novartis, have made dramatic shifts from Swiss-dominated boards and executive leadership to a diverse set of nationalities. Both now have non-Swiss majorities on their boards and several business units based outside Switzerland. Nestle’s executive board represents ten different nationalities, while 80% of Novartis executives come from outside Switzerland.</p><p>Focus on values, not hierarchy.&nbsp;The characteristics of successful global leaders today are quite different than traditional hierarchical managers. They need high levels of emotional intelligence and self-awareness to unite people of different cultures, many who are new to the enterprise, around the organization’s mission and its values and empower them to make decisions without waiting for higher-level directions.</p><p>Samuel Palmisano, IBM’s chairman and former CEO, recognized that IBM’s traditional hierarchical structure would not be effective in the 21st century because it was dominated by product and market silos. In 2003 he reorganized the company into an “<a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/hbsfaculty/2012/01/how-ibms-sam-palmisano-redefin.html\">integrated global enterprise</a>” based on leading by values and collaboration, and uses special bonuses to empower leaders to extend IBM’s culture globally.</p><a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/hbsfaculty/2012/01/how-ibms-sam-palmisano-redefin.html\">integrated global enterprise</a><p>Broaden the reach of leadership development.&nbsp;Collaborative organizations like IBM’s require far more leaders than the traditional focus on a select group of top leaders. With flatter organizations and decentralization of power, corporations must develop savvy global leaders capable of operating locally and globally simultaneously. IBM’s former chief learning officer recently estimated that IBM will need 50,000 leaders in the future.</p><p>Unilever has more than half of its business in Asia, and that percentage will continue to increase. The company has undertaken a major initiative to develop 500 global leaders in intensive leadership development programs to prepare them for expanded roles. According to CEO Paul Polman, “Unilever’s Leadership Development Programme prepares our future leaders for an increasingly volatile and uncertain world where the only true differentiation is the quality of leadership.”</p><p>To be effective in global roles, leaders require experience working and living in multiple countries. Extensive travel overseas is no substitute for living there, gaining fluency in local languages, and deeply immersing in the culture. German chemical maker Henkel, whose executives come from a diverse set of countries, insists they live in at least two different countries before being considered for promotion.</p><p>New methods for developing global leaders.&nbsp;Developing global leaders necessitates a shift from focusing on management skills to helping leaders be effective in different cultures by increasing their self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and resilience.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hbr.org/2012/01/what-business-schools-can-learn-from-the-medical-profession/ar/1\">Dean Nitin Nohria at Harvard Business School recently sent 900 MBA students overseas</a>&nbsp;to work with companies in countries where they have neither lived nor worked.</p><a href=\"http://hbr.org/2012/01/what-business-schools-can-learn-from-the-medical-profession/ar/1\">Dean Nitin Nohria at Harvard Business School recently sent 900 MBA students overseas</a><p>It’s not enough just to work overseas. To process and learn from their experiences, individuals should utilize introspective practices like journaling, meditation or prayer, and develop support networks of peers like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/09/true_north_groups.html\">True North Groups</a>. There they can consult confidentially with people they trust about important decisions and have honest conversations about their dilemmas, mistakes, and challenges. These experiences enable leaders to develop the self-mastery and appreciation and acceptance of people from diverse backgrounds required to become effective global leaders.</p><a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/09/true_north_groups.html\">True North Groups</a><p>These methods of developing global leaders for the future are still in their nascent phase, but there is little doubt that they will have a profound impact on developing global leaders in the years ahead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Developing Global Leaders Is America’s Competitive Advantage</h1><p>As global companies focus their strategies on developed and emerging markets, they require substantial cadres of leaders capable of operating effectively anywhere in the world. American companies and academic institutions possess unique competitive advantages in developing these global leaders. They are remarkably open to talented people from diverse backgrounds, and are highly skilled at giving future leaders the knowledge and experience they need to lead successfully in the global economy. As American leaders work with foreign nationals, they become more open, better informed, and more effective in collaborating with people around the world. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/hbsfaculty/2012/02/a-new-era-for-global-leadershi.html\">ability to develop global leaders</a>&nbsp;strengthens American companies and the U.S. economy, expands America’s global trade, and attracts foreign companies to base operations in the U.S.</p><a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/hbsfaculty/2012/02/a-new-era-for-global-leadershi.html\">ability to develop global leaders</a><p>Let’s examine the reasons why America possesses this important advantage:</p><p>1. America’s higher education system is a magnet for talented leaders from all over the world.&nbsp;The U.S. has become a Mecca for international scientists, engineers and business students — particularly those undertaking graduate studies. Since the 2008 financial collapse, a new generation of business school deans is placing increased emphasis on developing global leaders. In particular, Harvard, MIT, and Stanford have geared their programs toward global leaders: as a result, 26-38% of their graduate students are foreign nationals.</p><p>Here at Harvard Business School, Dean Nitin Nohria has revamped HBS’s MBA curriculum to emphasize practical leadership and global experiences. In January all 900 of HBS’s first-year students — 34% of whom are international students — worked in developing countries. In 2011, 71% of HBS’s new cases were written about foreign companies. HBS welcomes 6,360 foreign nationals (64% of the total) to its executive education courses each year, enriching the experiences for Americans as well. As a consequence, these foreign-born executives become more interested in doing business with American companies and many will eventually work in the U.S.</p><p>2. U.S. companies actively promote executive officers with diverse geographic and cultural backgrounds.&nbsp;Coca-Cola has been a pioneer in developing global leaders. It started 30 years ago with the progressive and unusual step (for that time) of shifting from local nationals as country managers to global leaders from other countries. This has enabled the company to develop exceptional global leaders. As a consequence, five of its CEOs have been non-American-born, including today’s CEO, Turkish-born Muhtar Kent. In addition, eight of its top nine line executives are from outside the U.S. Many global companies have followed Coke’s lead by appointing foreign-born CEOs and executives. For example, PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi was born in India, Avon’s Andrea Jung is Chinese-Canadian, and Medtronic CEO Omar Ishrak grew up in Bangladesh. UK-born George Buckley, CEO of 3M, will be succeeded by Swedish-born Inge Thulin. Half of 3M’s executive committee comes from outside America.</p><p>In contrast, the CEOs and executives of leading companies in Germany, India, Korea, Japan and China are almost all natives of their home countries. Swiss companies like Nestle, Novartis, and Credit Suisse are notable exceptions, as they have non-Swiss CEOs and a majority of non-Swiss executives.</p><p>3. American companies send their most promising leaders abroad for global leadership assignments.&nbsp;Major U.S. companies like Cargill, ExxonMobil, 3M, and IBM insist their line executives have numerous assignments running overseas operations to ensure they understand their global businesses. They also conduct intensive development programs for global leaders through in-house training programs. Two of the best-known programs, GE’s Crotonville and Goldman Sachs’s Pine Street, are committed to having 50% of participants from overseas entities.</p><p>4. The U.S. leverages its pool of top talent to attract research and business units.&nbsp;Many foreign companies are basing research centers and business units in the U.S. to take advantage of America’s talented leaders. In 2002 Novartis relocated its research headquarters from Switzerland to Boston and hired Harvard Cardiologist Mark Fishman as its leader. Nestle, Unilever, and Novartis have several business units based in the U.S. French pharmaceutical company Sanofi recently acquired Boston-based Genzyme to tap into America’s intellectual capital in biotechnology.</p><p>5. America fosters risk-taking and innovation by entrepreneurs who become global leaders.America has repeatedly demonstrated its capacity to develop entrepreneurs who start with revolutionary ideas and create global companies that dominate their markets. Intel, Microsoft, Apple, Genentech, Starbucks, Google, Cisco, Amazon, Medtronic and Facebook are some of the success stories resulting from an American culture that fosters risk-taking, openness, and innovation. Their successes globally have created enormous stakeholder value for their customers, employees, communities, and investors.</p><p>In the increasingly competitive global economy, the United States needs to take advantage of its ability to develop global leaders who are capable of addressing the complex challenges facing global institutions. Unfortunately, this unique American capability is often undermined by U.S. government policies, such as limitations on work permits for foreign graduates of American universities that force them to return to their home countries. Visa restrictions also limit U.S. companies from bringing foreign nationals to America for assignments enabling them to become global leaders. American executives, educators, and government officials need to collaborate to strengthen America’s leadership of the global economy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>How IBM’s Sam Palmisano Redefined the Global Corporation</h1><p>In the 20th century, a select group of leaders — General Motor’s Alfred Sloan, HP’s David Packard and Bill Hewlett, and GE’s Jack Welch — set the standard for the way corporations are run. In the 21st century only IBM’s Sam Palmisano has done so.</p><p>When Palmisano retired this month, the media chronicled his success by focusing on IBM’s 21% annual growth in earnings per share and its increase in market capitalization to $218 billion. But IBM hasn’t flourished because it kowtows to Wall Street. In fact, five years after Palmisano took over, IBM stock was stuck where it had been when his tenure began.</p><p>The real story behind IBM’s success is the course Palmisano set for 21st century global enterprises. Recognizing that the company’s command-and-control culture wouldn’t work in the 21st century, he defined leadership as leading by values and created a unique collaborative organizational structure.</p><p>In 2002 Palmisano succeeded a legendary leader in Lou Gerstner, who saved IBM from being broken up and put it on a viable course. Whereas Gerstner famously declared “the last thing IBM needs is a vision,” Palmisano had a clear vision for the company. He saw its unique strength as offering complete solutions tailored to customers’ needs — something no other company could match. To concentrate on customer solutions, Palmisano spun off personal computers and disk drives and acquired PriceWaterhouseCoopers’ consulting business.</p><p>Executing this strategy required seamless integration of IBM’s product capabilities with its geographic reach. This meant abandoning IBM’s existing organization, in which product silos and geographic entities operated independently and frequently were more competitive than collaborative. Palmisano reorganized IBM into a “globally integrated enterprise” focused on worldwide collaboration. He cajoled, pushed, and pulled the company into a client-centric, agile structure able to customize delivery of IBM’s software assets, hardware assets, and intellectual property.</p><p>With 440,000 employees in 170 countries, Palmisano recognized that IBM couldn’t be run solely from the top; rather, it needed thousands of leaders operating collaboratively around the globe to fulfill its customers’ diverse needs. His first act was to abolish IBM’s corporate executive committee.</p><p>Palmisano understood that reorganizing IBM’s formal structure wouldn’t be sufficient; he had to thoroughly transform the company’s culture and do so in a sustainable way. His ingenious first step toward creating a collaborative culture was a massive, global collaboration. In 2003 he launched an online, interactive “values jam” involving all employees for 72 hours to determine what IBM’s values should be. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/employment/our_values.html\">three principles that emerged from that event</a>&nbsp;guided decision-making throughout the organization, giving IBM’s huge, globally dispersed workforce the discipline necessary to execute the company’s new strategy.</p><a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/employment/our_values.html\">three principles that emerged from that event</a><p>Palmisano could not have succeeded at placing values at the center of IBM’s operations without strong principles of his own. These are the qualities I believe made him the best CEO, so far, of the 21st century:</p><p>Humility and openness.&nbsp;Palmisano has an engaging manner and keen sense of humor. Colleagues say his humility and humor are disarming. In a speech on IBM’s 100th anniversary, he said:</p><blockquote><p>The old model of the heroic superman is increasingly archaic. The most active and successful leaders today see themselves as part of the global community and peer groups. They listen as well as they speak. Never confuse charisma with leadership. The first job of a leader is to enable an organization to survive without him or her. The key to that is to build a sustainable culture.</p></blockquote><p>The old model of the heroic superman is increasingly archaic. The most active and successful leaders today see themselves as part of the global community and peer groups. They listen as well as they speak. Never confuse charisma with leadership. The first job of a leader is to enable an organization to survive without him or her. The key to that is to build a sustainable culture.</p><p>He practiced this by listening intently to employees throughout the organization. He also talked to customers on a daily basis and circumnavigated the globe six times a year to meet customers in person. These relationships were essential in gaining the confidence of customers who had qualms about outsourcing to IBM.</p><p>Patience and a long-term view.&nbsp;Palmisano warned against prioritizing shareholders or other constituents, calling this “a false choice,” and explaining that “Long-term management is a serious challenge in a world driven by short-term thinking. Forward-thinking leaders are not just achieving measurable success in the short-term. They are innovating in ways that create virtuous circles for a generation or more.” He was comfortable making smart bets to position IBM for decades-long growth, such as creating the Emerging Business Organization to incubate new businesses and shield them from P&amp;L pressures. And his time leading IBM’s Asia-Pacific business taught him about the value of building long-term relationships, not just doing transactions.</p><p>Directness.&nbsp;Palmisano believes the technology industry requires “a high-performance, in-your-face, speak-your-mind culture.” He’s personable, but blunt. Known for walking out of long meetings to make sales calls, he shortened IBM’s two-month annual budget process to six days. Instead of formal performance reviews, he regularly engaged in short conversations, focusing on key initiatives. Many who know him cite his impatience as a strength; it kept him relentlessly focused on execution.</p><p>Pragmatism.&nbsp;When the U.S. government cut back on work permits for foreign nationals, IBM had thousands of Indian employees forced to return to their home country. He turned that problem into competitive advantage by relocating most of IBM’s software operations to India as its Indian operations grew from 3,000 to 100,000 employees. He also forced partners and distributors to commit in writing to uphold IBM’s strict ethical standards. In 2009 he called off the $7 billion acquisition of Sun Microsystems in part due to Sun’s egregious golden parachutes.</p><p>As Palmisano built IBM into the world’s leading information technology company, its competitors dithered. HP suffered from a progression of strategic missteps and failed leaders. Microsoft’s enterprise services stagnated. Cisco now sells mostly commoditized products. In contrast, IBM kept laser-like focus on building the global organization to execute its strategy, and financial results followed.</p><p>Palmisano once said, “The CEO is not the brand! It is not about you. You are a temporary steward of a wonderful enterprise, so leave it in better shape than you find it.” As he concludes his career, he leaves his successor, Virginia Rometty, with an iconic giant poised to dominate its industry for decades to come.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Enhance Your Overseas Experience</h1><p>As the world becomes increasingly global, the need for true global citizens to lead organizations in business, nonprofits, and government is far greater than in decades past. Global citizens who understand the importance of cultural nuances are able to bring people together across organizational boundaries and are more effective working and collaborating anywhere in the world.</p><p>Becoming a global citizen requires that aspiring leaders spend time living in different countries early in life, so they can appreciate cultural differences, incorporate what they learn into their work lives, and build networks of global relationships. A key to the success of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/hbsfaculty/2012/01/how-ibms-sam-palmisano-redefin.html\">IBM’s Sam Palmisano</a>, for example, was the understanding he gained by living in Japan that enabled him to create IBM’s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/ibm/ideasfromibm/us/integration/010607/index.html\">“globally integrated enterprise”</a>&nbsp;in 2006.</p><a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/hbsfaculty/2012/01/how-ibms-sam-palmisano-redefin.html\">IBM’s Sam Palmisano</a><a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/ibm/ideasfromibm/us/integration/010607/index.html\">“globally integrated enterprise”</a><p>Corporations seek leaders who are comfortable in many cultures; they want those who can speak multiple languages and understand the nuances of doing business outside their home regions. In fact, many global companies have formal international rotation programs to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/01/multicultural_leadership_starts_fr.html\">build such global leaders</a>. German consumer company&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.henkel.com/index.htm\">Henkel</a>&nbsp;requires its leaders to work in at least two countries to be considered for promotion.</p><a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2012/01/multicultural_leadership_starts_fr.html\">build such global leaders</a><a href=\"http://www.henkel.com/index.htm\">Henkel</a><p>But the benefits aren’t just organizational. Living in different countries and cultures can lead to a rounder, more fulfilling life. Take our experiences, for example. Bill had formative experiences living with his family in Belgium in the early 1980s and in Switzerland ten years ago. Leading global businesses since the early 1970s and serving as a board member of two European companies, Bill’s travels throughout the world shaped his ideas for developing global leaders. John found working abroad in Europe and the Middle East not only improved his understanding of the importance of cultural and regional differences, but also helped him build a global network of friends and colleagues and lasting memories of the places he visited.</p><p>For aspiring leaders who want to become global citizens and increase their global fluency, here are some suggestions to get started:</p><p>1. Target at least one fundamentally different culture.&nbsp;While it may be tempting to live in a culture similar to your own — for example, Americans working in Great Britain — the most compelling learning experiences come from living in cultures that are sharply differently from your own. Chinese professionals working in South Africa, for example, will find their existing cultural assumptions challenged as they gain increased humility by learning local languages and coping with different norms.</p><p>2. Spend time studying overseas.&nbsp;Studying in different cultures enables young leaders to understand cultural nuances and become actively engaged with global organizations. Harvard Business School now sends all 900 MBAs to work overseas in its&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/mba/academics/FIELD/globalpartner.html\">Global Immersion Program</a>. Global organizations prefer candidates who have studied abroad because these early experiences will broaden your perspective about seeking fascinating global opportunities throughout your life. Look for opportunities, and if you’re already out of school, ask if your organization offers programs to give you experience abroad.</p><a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/mba/academics/FIELD/globalpartner.html\">Global Immersion Program</a><p>3. Learn the local language.&nbsp;As English becomes the language of business, it is tempting to get by with limited knowledge of local languages. That’s a mistake. Learning local languages enables you to appreciate cultural nuances and develop more personal relationships. Being fluent in multiple languages makes it easier to learn new ones and opens up career opportunities.</p><p>4. Don’t judge cultural differences or local people.&nbsp;When your new environment is sharply different from prior experiences, it’s tempting to make snap judgments about your experiences and stay attached to your own culture. Resist that temptation by observing, listening, learning, and understanding rather than judging. Use your insights to improve local ways of operating, but don’t rush to criticize.</p><p>5. Share international experiences with your family.&nbsp;Living in new countries brings your family much closer together and will be a time for growth, bonding, and learning as a family. Hold parties for your local neighbors, join a local church, and get involved in your children’s school. Host regular visits from parents and close friends. Balance breadth and depth in your travels to explore many different areas and countries, and spend time talking with local people. But don’t travel so much that you fail to get deeply involved in your new community and explore its richness.</p><p>The coming decades will belong to those global citizens who are comfortable operating anywhere in the world and who can collaborate with people of different cultures to develop solutions to the world’s most pressing problems. Organizations filled with these global citizens will not only survive but thrive and grow. For you, life will be richer and more fulfilling.</p>"

On the other hand, it makes perfect sense.&nbsp; CEOs who become acquainted with the power of peer advisory groups for themselves want to make it available to more executives in their organizations.&nbsp; HR executives and senior leaders at larger companies who seek to maximize their investments in executive development and create alignment to meet the challenges of the future are taking a closer look at starting peer advisory groups within their own organizations.&nbsp; Today’s employees, many of whom are working toward their master degrees, are often doing so as part of cohorts or learning teams – the academic equivalent to the peer advisory group.&nbsp; Upon graduation, they will continue to seek similar peer-to-peer opportunities in the workplace in greater numbers.&nbsp;

    "post_date": "January 8, 2012",
    "post_content": [
      "<p>MUNICH, GERMANY – The United States seems in awe of China’s economic miracle, but rather disdainful of Europe, especially Germany. To the contrary, there is great wisdom in the German economic model from which Minnesotans can learn.</p><p>Germany is a jobs machine. Its unemployment is just over 5 percent vs. 8.5 percent in the United States. In Munich unemployment is only 2.2 percent. Germany exports four times as much as the United States with only 30 percent of the population. It has a positive $200 billion trade balance, compared with negative $700 billion for America, and favorable trade balances with China, India and Japan, as well all European countries.</p><p>Germans are well-paid, have excellent health care and pension benefits, and save 11 percent of their income. Yet German health care costs only 9 percent of GDP compared with 17 percent in the U.S.</p><p>Politically, the country operates like a grand coalition, with narrow differences between moderates on both sides. Politicians put the country’s interests ahead of their parties. A decade ago the government went through a restructuring that moderated the cost of wages and benefits to be competitive with Asian countries. Germany is fiscally responsible: inflation is just over 1 percent, and deficits are 3.3 percent of GDP compared with 11 percent for the U.S.</p><p>German industrial strategy focuses on sectors where its technology and highly skilled workforce provide competitive advantage: machine tools, automobiles and auto parts, chemicals, electrical equipment and construction. Its financial sector finances German industry at home and around the world. It operates with conservative ratios that enabled most German banks to escape the 2008 financial meltdown.</p><p>Leading German companies like Siemens, BMW, Volkswagen, Daimler, BASF, and Thyssen-Krupp are flourishing these days. But there are deeper reasons for Germany’s success: relationships between labor and management; its apprentice system, and the Mittelstand — small and medium-size privately held enterprises.</p><p><strong>Labor-management relations.</strong>&nbsp;German unions have long practiced “co-determination” with management on corporate boards, but their approach differs dramatically from American counterparts. They are committed to ensuring that their companies do well, produce superior products, and are cost-competitive. Work rules are flexible. Strikes are rare. They focus on collaborative relationships to make their enterprises competitive on a world scale.</p><strong>Labor-management relations.</strong><p><strong>Apprentice system:</strong>&nbsp;German education utilizes a rigorous system of preparing students for jobs and careers. Students are divided into those who enter gymnasium (high school) to prepare for university education and others who are better suited for careers in skilled positions in 342 recognized trades. They complete their education prepared for a career suited to their talents; dropouts are rare. Those in skilled-labor tracks move into three-year apprenticeships where they learn specific skills, such as computer programming or operating complex computer-controlled machinery. Educators work closely with industrial counterparts to understand skills required for future jobs. Heinrich Heimbold, CEO of Thyssen-Krupp, the world’s second-largest steel company, believes labor relationships and apprentices have given his company advantage over U.S. and Asian competitors.</p><strong>Apprentice system:</strong><p><strong>Mittelstand companies.&nbsp;</strong>These small and medium-sized firms are export-oriented and focus on high-value manufactured products utilizing skilled apprentices. Typically, they are rural and privately owned and occupy worldwide niche market leadership positions. Mittelstand companies combine long-term approaches with modern management practices like lean manufacturing and total quality management. They work closely with universities and researchers and cluster around large manufacturers. Owner-managers often rub shoulders with workers.</p><strong>Mittelstand companies.&nbsp;</strong><p>Steven Rosenstone, the new chancellor of Minnesota State Colleges and Universities, believes in the German approach to education and industrial competitiveness. “It’s a painful reality that many of the 215,000 Minnesotans without jobs don’t have the education needed for the new economy,” he said. “By 2018, 78 percent of all Minnesota jobs will require some post-secondary education.” Rosenstone is restructuring MnSCU to train people for future needs, and also creating custom retraining programs for existing employees.</p><p>Minnesota’s CEOs are recognizing the importance of Minnesota’s skilled workforce. Cargill CEO Greg Page is leading a task force to address these education issues. Ecolab CEO Doug Baker Jr., who chairs Greater MSP, said: “Ultimately, the education and skills of the workforce is MSP’s competitive advantage.”</p><p>In my view, Minnesota gave up too soon on manufacturing competitiveness to focus on the service sector. It’s time to refocus on manufacturing advanced technology products, using skilled labor to enable Minnesota companies to compete globally and restore full employment. It’s not too late.</p><hr><p><a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/business/136776593.html?page=all&amp;prepage=2&amp;c=y#continue\">Originially Posted in the Minneapolis Star Tribune on January 7, 2012</a></p><a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/business/136776593.html?page=all&amp;prepage=2&amp;c=y#continue\">Originially Posted in the Minneapolis Star Tribune on January 7, 2012</a><p><a href=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/page/readers-respond-to-my-article-on-german-economic-miracle\">Read reader’s comments</a> and reactions to the article above</p><a href=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/page/readers-respond-to-my-article-on-german-economic-miracle\">Read reader’s comments</a><div></div>"

The twenty-first century has been rocked by scandals and failures of leaders in the baby boomer generation. In business, companies like Enron and individuals like Bernard Madoff have broken laws and violated trust. In 2008 financial markets melted down, triggering the Great Recession and costing millions of people their jobs. Governments have failed to demonstrate fiscal responsibility, creating trillions in debt and stifling global growth.</p><p>After a decade of problems, it’s not hard to see why people take to the streets or grow distrustful of those who bear responsibility for the troubles we face and who have too often put their self-interest ahead of their institutions.</p><p>But while senior leaders have often failed to fulfill their responsibilities, we see many hopeful signs that the Gen X and millennial generations have learned from these failures and are prepared to step up their leadership in these trying times.</p><p>According to a recent survey of 500 young MBAs from top business schools:</p><ul>\n<li style=\"border-image: initial; outline-width: 0px; outline-style: initial; outline-color: initial; vertical-align: baseline; background-image: initial; background-attachment: initial; background-origin: initial; background-clip: initial; background-color: transparent; list-style-type: disc; list-style-position: initial; list-style-image: initial; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; border: 0px initial initial;\">The emerging generation is actively thinking about its responsibilities and taking on leadership roles.

But we think there are signs that the next generation of leaders has learned from these crises.

      "<p>Originially Posted: <a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424052748704746704577094782948581256.html?mod=BOL_twm_fs#articleTabs_article%3D0\">Barrons on December 17, 2011</a><br>By: Leslie P. Norton</p><a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424052748704746704577094782948581256.html?mod=BOL_twm_fs#articleTabs_article%3D0\">Barrons on December 17, 2011</a><br><hr><p>Here’s to the next hundred years,” declares Sam Palmisano’s Christmas card on the 100-year anniversary of IBM’s founding. The card exudes the same gusto that has rallied hundreds of thousands of IBM workers for the past decade. But the gregarious head of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=IBM\">International Business Machines</a>&nbsp;(ticker: IBM) won’t be around for the next centennial: Now 60, IBM’s mandatory retirement age, Palmisano will end his decade as CEO on New Year’s Eve. Already, he is introducing Virginia Rometty, the incoming CEO and IBM’s powerful global sales chief, as “the boss.”</p><a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=IBM\">International Business Machines</a><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“The CEO is not the brand! It is not you. It is not about you.” So proclaims the eighth, and longest-serving, CEO since IBM’s founder, Thomas Watson Sr. Palmisano might be the world’s least-bashful person, except when it comes to taking credit for his job. Then he’s quick to set you straight. That recognition properly belongs to his coworkers, he insists. In fact, he describes his long run as “10% of 100 years.”</p><p>“You are a temporary steward of a wonderful enterprise, so leave it in better shape than you find it,” Palmisano says. That, he has done in myriad ways. In the course of his tenure, Palmisano dumped most of IBM’s money-losing computer-hardware businesses, expanded into higher-margin businesses such as software and services, and moved decisively into fast-growing markets, including the developing world and digitized systems for cities.&nbsp;<em>Barron’s</em>&nbsp;has chronicled much of this journey, most recently in “<a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111903337604576456012371891154.html\">Big Blue Muscles Through</a>,” (July 25, 2011).</p><em>Barron’s</em><a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/article/SB50001424053111903337604576456012371891154.html\">Big Blue Muscles Through</a><p>IBM’s earnings have sprinted 21% a year, on average, in the past 10 years, to $11.52 a share in 2010. They probably rose by double-digits again this year. Despite two recessions, including one that still haunts the economy, a host of good financial metrics are even stronger. Gross profits are up, margins have widened and IBM now owns the world’s most valuable brand after Coca-Cola. Had you invested in IBM in March 2002, when Palmisano succeeded Louis Gerstner as CEO, you would have doubled your money and outperformed the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500 by three times.</p><p>The approach to Palmisano’s office at IBM’s Armonk, N.Y., headquarters is stately, with a soaring ceiling. By contrast, his conference room is small and simply decorated. On the windowsill is a photo of Palmisano grinning with Linus Torvalds, inventor of the open-source operating system Linux. A snowstorm threatens on this gray day. Then Palmisano bustles in. His eyes twinkle behind horn-rimmed glasses that give him an owlish mien. A couple of inches above six feet, wearing the requisite IBM dark-blue business suit, he appears thoroughly comfortable with himself.</p><p>During his conversation with&nbsp;<em>Barron’s</em>, he throws his body into his anecdotes and readily specifies where rivals fall short. When crowing over rival&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=AMZN\">Amazon.com</a>‘s (AMZN) efforts in cloud computing, Palmisano points one finger up and exclaims: “IBM has one deal bigger than all of Amazon’s cloud business. One bigger than anything they’ve ever done! One deal!”</p><em>Barron’s</em><a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=AMZN\">Amazon.com</a><p>He marvels at the accounting of the new Internet-related companies that, he says, are, among other things, prorating commission expenses, treating them like capital expenditures. “All of a sudden, somebody is going to wake up and say, ‘You can’t account for your sales expense from the balance sheet and prorate it with the revenue, like it’s project accounting in the construction industry,’ ” he says. “If we took all the expenses and put them on our balance sheet, then we could have some earnings!” A hundred-year-old company, he says, can’t do such things.</p><p><strong>PALMISANO WAS BORN IN 1951</strong>&nbsp;to an Italian-American family in Baltimore. His grandparents didn’t speak English, his father owned an auto-repair shop and his mother ruled the household with an iron hand and a supply of wooden spoons for rapping knuckles. In the ninth grade, with sagging grades, Palmisano got into a fight at a Catholic school. The priests immediately stuck him in a boxing program, and his mother sat him in front of her every night and inspected his homework. “No lawyers were called in! We didn’t sue the school. Do you think my self-esteem suffered? Did my mother have me see a shrink? No,” he relates, with impatience at current customs.</p><strong>PALMISANO WAS BORN IN 1951</strong><p>The future CEO played saxophone in the band, and also football. As center, one of the least glamorous positions on the team, Palmisano was the guy who handed the football to the quarterback. The center protects the offense and blocks people. Something weird has to happen for him to score. But it’s also one of the most important positions on the team. The center needs to be tough, aggressive and consistent.</p><p>After graduating from Johns Hopkins in 1973, and turning down a tryout with the Oakland Raiders, Palmisano went to IBM. He never looked back. He quickly established himself as a rising star, working as then-CEO John Akers’ executive assistant and serving two stints in Japan. Along the way, he got married, and he and his wife, nicknamed Missy, had four children, now grown.</p><p>But in the 1980s, IBM stumbled as PCs and servers replaced mainframe computers. The board hired Lou Gerstner, the only outsider ever to serve as CEO. He famously slashed the work force and started pushing the service business. Palmisano ran global services, PCs, then servers. He was a gifted salesman, dubbed “the Closer” by colleagues. He also paved the way for Big Blue to snare gigantic billion-dollar deals.</p><p>When Palmisano became CEO, he had already been pressing IBM to adopt Linux for its systems and push more heavily into services. The company bought PriceWaterhouse-Coopers Consulting. He streamlined management, dispersing the executive committee, and invited the entire company to participate in a “values jam” on the IBM intranet to assess strategic priorities. (One result: greater power to low-level managers to make fast decisions.) As he repositioned Big Blue into higher-margin businesses and built overseas operations, he held managers to high performance standards. Yet his affability and his ability to woo the customers kept him popular.</p><p><strong>ALL THE WHILE, KEY INSIGHTS</strong>&nbsp;about how the world was changing drove the strategy. One was about outsourcing: As corporations grew more global, employees would no longer fight it out by product and geography. Companies could hand over more and more of the work they previously did in-house to outside specialists, because best practices and the Internet made that possible. The corporation, he wrote in Foreign Affairs, could now be “an array of specialized components: procurement, manufacturing, research, sales.”</p><strong>ALL THE WHILE, KEY INSIGHTS</strong><p>Palmisano also saw that with cheap semiconductors, computational power was being put into things we wouldn’t recognize as computers. By 2010, there would be a billion transistors for every human being alive, and 30 billion RFID tags embedded throughout the world. That could make the world vastly more intelligent, if it wasn’t swamped by streams of data. Enter the concept of the Smarter Planet, which he introduced days after President Obama was elected. That lit a fire under IBM’s analytics division, which helps customers handle mountains of data for their strategic needs. “His view of the global corporation was five to 10 years ahead of its time,” says Bill George, the former Medtronic CEO who now serves on ExxonMobil’s board with Palmisano.</p><p>Enlarge Image</p><p>The strategic shifts frustrated shareholders and the stock went nowhere. Palmisano huddled with his lieutenants and unveiled the company’s first road map in 2007, showing how IBM planned to allocate capital and detailing its long-term earnings targets. Analysts were cautious. “We said, ‘We think we can go from $6 to $11, and this is how we do it: Revenue, productivity, share buybacks,’ fatter margins,” Palmisano recalls. “To be credible means you need to have some granularity. We felt this is what you should do for investors: Give them a long-term view, not a view of the next six seconds.” The current road map shows how IBM plans to double earnings to at least $20 a share between 2010 and 2015.</p><p>Once the road map was in place, it began to change management behavior. “We had to get ourselves comfortable internally so we could be credible and specific,” says Palmisano. Every manager had a target and a five-year view. One consequence: The entire fall budget-planning session wraps up in six days. It once took two months.</p><p>Since IBM announced its road map, it has met or beaten its own forecasts every year. Today, Big Blue derives 23% of revenue from software, 58% from services and just 17% from hardware. Palmisano is exceptionally excited about the analytics division. Watson, the&nbsp;<em>Jeopardy</em>-playing computer, is one product.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=wlp\">WellPoint</a>&nbsp;(WLP) recently announced plans to use Watson to suggest treatment options and diagnoses to doctors. It can mine a ton of data, thus saving on excessive testing. “There are 10 million pages of new medical research issued every year,” says Palmisano. Watson can process 200 million pages of content in less than three seconds. “The biggest thing that will transform business is analytics,” says Palmisan, and he pegs the market at $16 billion.</p><em>Jeopardy</em><a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=wlp\">WellPoint</a><p>One sign of success: imitation.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=HPQ\">Hewlett-Packard</a>&nbsp;(HPQ),&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=DELL\">Dell&nbsp;</a>(DELL) and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=ORCL\">Oracle</a>(ORCL) are all pushing into consulting and services. The road map is also widely admired. Last week&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=GE\">General Electric</a>&nbsp;(GE) made some gestures in that direction when it talked about near-term, double-digit earnings-per-share growth and a long-term view of cash allocation.</p><a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=HPQ\">Hewlett-Packard</a><a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=DELL\">Dell&nbsp;</a><a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=ORCL\">Oracle</a><a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=GE\">General Electric</a><p>“In the investment community, IBM is held up as a keen example of a great company, because they’re very prescriptive and very specific about their intentions,” says Greg Brown, CEO of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=MSI\">Motorola Solutions</a>&nbsp;(MSI).</p><a href=\"http://online.barrons.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=MSI\">Motorola Solutions</a><p>It was on a CNBC interview with Warren Buffett last month that Palmisano first heard Buffett had bought $11 billion of IBM. He knew somebody had been buying IBM shares throughout the year, but never suspected Buffett, who is famously averse to investments in technology. But Buffett specifically cited the road map. “You’re the boss,” Palmisano told Rometty. “You call, and after you call, I’ll speak with him.”</p><p><strong>A FORMER HISTORY MAJOR, PALMISANO&nbsp;</strong>doesn’t believe in the “Great Man Theory.” The notion of a charismatic leader, he says, “is quite the opposite of what is required to be successful in running a large industrial company that has been around for a very long period of time. The tablets don’t need to come down from Mount Sinai.”</p><strong>A FORMER HISTORY MAJOR, PALMISANO&nbsp;</strong><p>In the next several months, Palmisano will remain chairman of IBM and make sure Rometty gets off to a great start, much as Gerstner did for him—coaching the new CEO through earnings announcements and meetings with investors, analysts and the board. Then he will leave as Gerstner did. He doesn’t know what his next move is; Gerstner had a lucrative career in private equity post-IBM.

People need guidance and direction, and comfort that the size of the sandbox we’re playing in is defined. Sam gives you the comfort of knowing that you are, in some part, in some fashion, part of the tribe.

We often try to, imagining that we can see and know the things we need to know without the discerning eye of a outside point of view. Bill George and Doug Baker remind us in<a href=\"http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781609940072.html\"><em>True North Groups</em></a>&nbsp;that, “We need people around us to whom we can look for support and advice, who can help us develop as human beings. We need them to help us become better leaders in our work, our communities, and our families.”&nbsp;</p><a href=\"http://www.leadershipnow.com/leadershop/9781609940072.html\"><em>True North Groups</em></a><em>True North Groups</em><p>It’s easy to get off track. “<strong>Most of us know what our True North is, but we are constantly pressured from external sources to deviate from it.</strong>&nbsp;Or we are seduced by extrinsic rewards like money, power, and recognition that cause us to detour from our True North.”&nbsp;</p><strong>Most of us know what our True North is, but we are constantly pressured from external sources to deviate from it.</strong><p>A True North Group is comprised of six to eight trusted peers who meet on a regular basis to discuss the important questions of their lives and to support each other during difficult times. At various times, each person in the group will serve as a mentor or coach to others.&nbsp;</p><p>True North Groups are not just about having a place to go to help you with your challenges. Done well, a group will encourage you to make the necessary course corrections that will help you to avoid the avoidable problems we all can get ourselves into. Save us from ourselves so to speak. It’s also a place to share successes.&nbsp;</p><p>At stake is our own vulnerability. Even if we are afraid of the idea, it’s not difficult to see the value in it. George and Baker have been doing this for decades and share to nuts and bolts of creating your own group. It begins with picking the right people and that may not include your close friends. It’s based on trust and a commitment to personal growth. The authors list the following characteristics of ideal group members:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul>\n<li>Curiosity about themselves, others and the world</li>\n<li>Willingness to challenge assumptions about life</li>\n<li>Comfort with self-reflection</li>\n<li>Commitment to continuing personal growth</li>\n<li>Respect for themselves and others</li>\n<li>Ability to listen without judgment</li>\n<li>Ability to hold confidences</li>\n<li>Willingness to be open and share their life stories</li>\n<li>Not self-absorbed</li>\n<li>Ability to commit time and energy to the group</li>\n<li>A sense of humor and a positive outlook on life is always helpful.</li>\n</ul><li>Curiosity about themselves, others and the world</li><li>Willingness to challenge assumptions about life</li><li>Comfort with self-reflection</li><li>Commitment to continuing personal growth</li><li>Respect for themselves and others</li><li>Ability to listen without judgment</li><li>Ability to hold confidences</li><li>Willingness to be open and share their life stories</li><li>Not self-absorbed</li><li>Ability to commit time and energy to the group</li><li>A sense of humor and a positive outlook on life is always helpful.</li><p>Next steps include,&nbsp;<strong>Norming</strong>&nbsp;(establishing how the group functions),&nbsp;<strong>Storming</strong>(behaviors that may impede your group),&nbsp;<strong>Performing</strong>&nbsp;(maintaining and renewing your group) and&nbsp;<strong>Reforming</strong>&nbsp;(the need to restructure and start again).&nbsp;</p><strong>Norming</strong><strong>Storming</strong><strong>Performing</strong><strong>Reforming</strong><p>The appendix provides topics for discussion to get your group going and thinking in the right direction. You’ll also find Member Contracts, Ground Rules and other valuable resources for your own True North Group.&nbsp;</p><table cellspacing=\"5\" cellpadding=\"0\" border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#cccccc\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<table cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Trying to develop yourself as a leader on your own is risky.&nbsp;<strong>True North Groups</strong>&nbsp;are a way to grow as a human being and as a leader in an environment of trust, confidentiality, intimacy, affirmation, support and honest feedback.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#cccccc\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<table cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Trying to develop yourself as a leader on your own is risky.&nbsp;<strong>True North Groups</strong>&nbsp;are a way to grow as a human being and as a leader in an environment of trust, confidentiality, intimacy, affirmation, support and honest feedback.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody><tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n<td width=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#cccccc\">&nbsp;</td>\n<td>\n<table cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Trying to develop yourself as a leader on your own is risky.&nbsp;<strong>True North Groups</strong>&nbsp;are a way to grow as a human being and as a leader in an environment of trust, confidentiality, intimacy, affirmation, support and honest feedback.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td width=\"1\" bgcolor=\"#cccccc\">&nbsp;</td><td>\n<table cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Trying to develop yourself as a leader on your own is risky.&nbsp;<strong>True North Groups</strong>&nbsp;are a way to grow as a human being and as a leader in an environment of trust, confidentiality, intimacy, affirmation, support and honest feedback.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</td><table cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Trying to develop yourself as a leader on your own is risky.&nbsp;<strong>True North Groups</strong>&nbsp;are a way to grow as a human being and as a leader in an environment of trust, confidentiality, intimacy, affirmation, support and honest feedback.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Trying to develop yourself as a leader on your own is risky.&nbsp;<strong>True North Groups</strong>&nbsp;are a way to grow as a human being and as a leader in an environment of trust, confidentiality, intimacy, affirmation, support and honest feedback.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody><tr>\n<td>Trying to develop yourself as a leader on your own is risky.&nbsp;<strong>True North Groups</strong>&nbsp;are a way to grow as a human being and as a leader in an environment of trust, confidentiality, intimacy, affirmation, support and honest feedback.</td>\n</tr><td>Trying to develop yourself as a leader on your own is risky.&nbsp;<strong>True North Groups</strong>&nbsp;are a way to grow as a human being and as a leader in an environment of trust, confidentiality, intimacy, affirmation, support and honest feedback.</td><strong>True North Groups</strong>"

One day I’m driving home, I look at myself, and I see a miserable person in the mirror.

They said, “We have seen these changes in you, and yeah, you seem like you’re not being as authentic as you were; you’re kind of trying to put on a role or a façade on this corporate ladder.”</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">I acknowledged they were right, and then one of them said, “You know, you’ve turned down Medtronic for a job several times. What about Medtronic?” And it caused me to go back to Medtronic to rethink that, and I can tell you, it was the best thing that ever happened to me in my professional life. But had it not been for that defining moment, and the opportunity to talk to my men’s group, I don’t think I would have done that.</span></div><span><span style=\"font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br></span></span><span><br></span><br><span>AMA: How have you personally benefited from these groups?</span><br><span>BG: The groups have been very beneficial in my life at crucial times.

In fact, I would go so far as to say reading is simply a necessity if you’re serious about leadership. I’m constantly asked for reading recommendations, and rather than provide you with the current best seller list du jour (you can get that anywhere), I’ve compiled a list of 20 leadership books everyone should read, but may not have. The list below (in no particular order) is comprised of leadership lessons from Ancient History, US History, Religious History, Military History, and yes, I threw in a few of my favorite business business classics as well.

If you read this book and don’t find inspiration to up your game, then it’s time to do some serious thinking.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/ESV-Study-Bible-Crossway-Bibles/dp/1433502410/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322726507&amp;sr=1-2\" target=\"_blank\">The Bible</a><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>– Whether you’re religious or not, there is simply no greater blueprint for developing wisdom, discernment, humility, and every other leadership trait known to man. The leadership examples outlined in Scripture are simply second to none.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Lincoln-Leadership-Executive-Strategies-Tough/dp/0446394599/ref=sr_1_19?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322721930&amp;sr=1-19\" target=\"_blank\">Lincoln on Leadership</a><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>–&nbsp;</em></strong>Many regard Lincoln as our nation’s greatest president, and while I happen to personally lean towards Washington, there is no disputing Lincoln’s stature as a great statesman and leader. Coming from a dysfunctional family, enduring a long line of personal and professional failures leading up to his presidency, and having to deal with a nation divided by civil war, Lincoln’s accomplishments as a leader are nothing short of remarkable.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Becoming-Leader-Warren-Bennis/dp/0465014089/ref=pd_sim_b_8\" target=\"_blank\">On Becoming A Leader</a><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>–&nbsp;</em></strong>Two words – Warren Bennis. Having the opportunity to get to know Warren has been a great gift to me, and reading his thoughts on leadership will surely be one for you.

This book combines several of his best pieces in one volume, and is a must read for anyone looking to understand organizational, operational, or cultural management theory. I had the chance to meet Peter on two different occasions. I didn’t know him well by any measure, but the brief encounters created a lasting impression.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Bonhoeffer-Pastor-Martyr-Prophet-Spy/dp/1595551387/ref=tmm_hrd_title_0\" target=\"_blank\">Bonhoeffer</a><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>– Few men have aligned their beliefs with their actions in the way that Dietrich Bonhoeffer did. A brilliant theologian hanged by Hitler, Bonhoeffer’s life is a testimony of ethical conviction that many of our leaders today should go to school on.

My friend Jim Strock has created a manifesto that is in my opinion the preeminent work on the subject. This is a must read for anyone in a leadership role. By the way, Jim’s book on Reagan is also first rate.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Washington-Life-Ron-Chernow/dp/1594202664/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322720736&amp;sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\">Washington: A Life</a><em>&nbsp;</em><em>–&nbsp;</em>A life study in character and doing the right thing.

I read this book in a single sitting and found it to be a gripping account of courage, duty, honor, and service beyond self.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Xenophons-Cyrus-Great-Arts-Leadership/dp/0312364695/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322721393&amp;sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\">Xenophon’s Cyrus the Great</a><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>–&nbsp;</em>If you struggle with leading in a complex culture, then you’ll find there is much to be gleaned from Cyrus the Great. This is perhaps one of the earliest accounts of leadership, but one of the most powerful. To conquer a nation is one thing, to gain their respect and lead them with benevolence after the fact is quite another. This is a fascinating read.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/True-North-Discover-Authentic-Leadership/dp/0787987514/ref=pd_sim_b_1\" target=\"_blank\">True North</a><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>–&nbsp;</em></strong>Bill George, former CEO of Medtronic provides a simple step-by-step guide for being an authentic leader. This book is a great help for leaders who desire to not live in emotional or intellectual conflict. If you need help in aligning vision, values, strategy, tactics, expectations, and outcomes then this book is for you.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Leading-Change-John-P-Kotter/dp/0875847471/ref=sr_1_60?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322722470&amp;sr=1-60\">Leading Change</a><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>–&nbsp;</em></strong>Being a Harvard Business School Professor doesn’t automatically qualify you to give leadership advice. That said, this rule doesn’t apply to professor Kotter. This book uses real world case studies to break down the elements that must be identified and managed in order to lead successful change. If you or your organization struggles with change, then this book needs to be on your reading list.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/EntreLeadership-Practical-Business-Wisdom-Trenches/dp/1451617852/ref=sr_1_61?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322722628&amp;sr=1-61\" target=\"_blank\">EntreLeadership</a><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong>– Most people think of Dave Ramsey as a commentator on personal financial advice. True, but Dave is also a brilliant businessman, who oozes wisdom and offers sound counsel to anyone attempting to be a better leader. This is a relatively new book, so if you haven’t read it yet, make sure you do.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/First-Break-All-Rules-Differently/dp/0684852861/ref=sr_1_75?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322722775&amp;sr=1-75\" target=\"_blank\">First, Break All The Rules</a><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>–&nbsp;</em></strong>I have not had the opportunity to meet Marcus Buckingham, but I’m a huge fan. Most of you know that I have long believed that while conventional wisdom might be conventional, it rarely constitutes wisdom. In this book Buckingham flips conventional business theory on it’s head and challenges you to reexamine how you look at the world. This is a must read book for any leader.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Washingtons-Civility-Behavior-Company-Conversation/dp/155709103X/ref=pd_sim_b_23\" target=\"_blank\">George Washington’s Rules of Civility</a><strong>&nbsp;</strong><em>–&nbsp;</em>No leader in history worked on building character more than George Washington. Character was more than a trait, it was a discipline of study for Washington. This wisdom in this book, is in my opinion, has regrettably all but disappeared in today’s world – regardless of what you observe around you, leadership is at its best when civility, character, on honor are visibly present.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Robert-Lee-Leadership-Executive-Character/dp/0761525548/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322723308&amp;sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\">Robert E. Lee on Leadership</a><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>–&nbsp;</em></strong>Lee was not only a great leader, but he was a true gentleman with character beyond reproach. Leadership lessons from General Lee’s life can be used in virtually any situation during any era. A must read for all leaders.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Churchill-Leadership-Executive-Success-Adversity/dp/0761514406/ref=pd_sim_b_10\" target=\"_blank\">Churchill on Leadership</a><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><em>–&nbsp;</em>Winston Churchill is one of my favorite leaders of the 20th Century. A man of both keen insight and intellect, but also a humble man with a great sense of the importance of his role not only to the country, but to the world in which he lived. This is a timeless account of a very principled man whose leadership may have just saved the world.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Exceeding-Expectations-General-Bill-Looney/dp/0982018517/ref=sr_1_24?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322724064&amp;sr=1-24\" target=\"_blank\">Exceeding Expectations</a><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>–&nbsp;</em></strong>This book contains leadership lessons from retired Air Force General Bill Looney. General Looney is a leader who knows something about exceeding expectations. He did it himself during a career that spanned 4 decades, but most importantly, he inspired others to do the same. This book is very readable, and has very actionable advice for leaders.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Benjamin-Franklins-Art-Virtue-Successful/dp/0938399101/ref=pd_sim_b_4\" target=\"_blank\">Benjamin Franklin’s The Art of Virtue</a><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>–&nbsp;</em></strong>This book is Benjamin Franklin’s personal guide for how one should live their live. Much like Washington’s&nbsp;<em>Rules of Civility</em>&nbsp;above, it’s a masterclass on character.</li>\n</ol><li><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Founding-Fathers-Leadership-Teamwork-Changing/dp/0446674257/ref=pd_sim_b_1\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>The Founding Fathers On Leadership</strong></a>&nbsp;</em>– There are great lessons to be learned from those who placed there lives at risk to give birth to a nation founded on the ideals of liberty and freedom.

Schwartz\" rel=\"author\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/nelson_d_schwartz/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">NELSON D. SCHWARTZ</a><br>November 22, 2011</p><br><a title=\"More Articles by Nelson D. Schwartz\" rel=\"author\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/nelson_d_schwartz/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">NELSON D. SCHWARTZ</a><br><hr><p>When Pfizer cut its research budget this year and laid off 1,100 employees, it was not because the company needed to save money.</p><p>In fact, the drug maker had so much cash left over, it decided to buy back an additional $5 billion worth of stock on top of the $4 billion already earmarked for repurchases in 2011 and beyond.</p><p>The moves, announced on the same day, might seem at odds with each other, but they represent an increasingly common pattern among American corporations, which are sitting on record amounts of cash but insist that growth opportunities are hard to find.</p><p>The result is that at a time when the nation is looking for ways to battle unemployment, big companies are creating fewer jobs, and critics say they are neglecting to lay the foundation for future growth by expanding into new businesses or building new plants.</p><p>What is more, share buybacks have not fulfilled their stated purpose of rewarding investors over the last decade, experts say. “It’s a symptom of a deeper problem, which is a lack of investment in the long term,” said William W. George, a Harvard Business School professor and former chief executive of Medtronic, a medical technology company. “If we’re not investing in research, innovation and entrepreneurship, we’re going to be a slow-growth country for a decade.”</p><p>Liberal critics insist the trend is another example of top corporate executives raking in an inordinate share of the nation’s wealth, even as their employees suffer.</p><p>“It’s an extraordinarily unimaginative way to use money,” said Robert Reich, a former secretary of labor under President Clinton who now teaches public policy at the University of California, Berkeley. After diving in the wake of the financial crisis, buybacks have made a remarkable comeback in recent years, with $445 billion authorized this year, the most since 2007, when repurchases peaked at $914 billion.</p><p>But spending on capital investments like new plants and infrastructure has stagnated more broadly in corporate America, confounding efforts by the Obama administration to spur economic growth. Capital expenditures by companies on the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index are expected to total $546 billion in 2011, down from $560 billion in 2008, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters Eikon.</p><p>The principle behind buybacks is simple. With fewer shares in circulation, earnings per share can rise smartly even if the company’s underlying growth is lackluster. In many cases, like that of the medical device maker&nbsp;<a title=\"Web site\" href=\"http://www.zimmer.com/en-US/index.jspx\">Zimmer Holdings</a>, executives are able to meet goals for profit growth and earn bigger bonuses despite poor stock performance.</p><a title=\"Web site\" href=\"http://www.zimmer.com/en-US/index.jspx\">Zimmer Holdings</a><p>“It’s clear there’s a conflict of interest,” said Charles M. Elson, director of the&nbsp;<a title=\"Web site\" href=\"http://www.lerner.udel.edu/centers/ccg\">John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance</a>&nbsp;at the University of Delaware. “Unless earnings per share are adjusted to reflect the buyback, then to base a bonus on raw earnings per share is problematic. It doesn’t purely reflect performance.”</p><a title=\"Web site\" href=\"http://www.lerner.udel.edu/centers/ccg\">John L. Weinberg Center for Corporate Governance</a><p>In addition, executives, who are often large shareholders, stand to benefit from even a small, short-term jump in stock prices.</p><p>Earlier this month, Pfizer increased its estimate for stock repurchases this year to between $7 billion and $9 billion — essentially spending in one year nearly all of the money it set aside in February for multiyear buybacks. There has been a steady drumbeat of other companies laying off workers even as they have disclosed plans to buy back more stock. On June 23, Campbell Soup said it would buy back $1 billion in stock; five days later it announced plans to eliminate 770 jobs. Hewlett-Packard announced a $10 billion stock repurchase in July, and jettisoned 500 jobs in September after it discontinued its TouchPad and smartphone product lines.</p><p>Last month, the first layoffs began at Zimmer’s plant in Statesville, N.C., which is due to shut early next year. The company made splints and tourniquets there for more than three decades. For the sewing machine operators and the rest of the 124 workers at the plant, it is bad news, but it is a different story for Zimmer’s top executives.</p><p>Powered by huge stock buybacks — the company bought $500 million worth of its own shares last year, more than twice what it spent on research and development — Zimmer posted earnings growth of 10 percent a share, even though operating income and revenue grew by less than 5 percent in 2010.</p><p>That helped its senior management, including the chief executive, David C. Dvorak, collect millions in cash and stock incentive payments by meeting earnings-per-share goals. For example, 50 percent of Mr. Dvorak’s $1.03 million cash bonus was tied to achieving per-share earnings of $4.28 in 2010. The company earned $4.33, but without the share repurchases the company would have made $4 to $4.10 a share.</p><p>Investors have not rewarded the strategy, however: Zimmer’s shares have dropped 32 percent in the last five years, while Pfizer’s are down 30 percent in the same period.</p><p>Over the last decade, in fact, companies that spent the most on repurchases had a total shareholder return of 37 percent versus 127 percent for companies that spent the least, according to research by Gregory V. Milano, chief executive of Fortuna Advisors, which consults with companies on how to raise their share price over the long term.</p><p>In the cases of Pfizer and Zimmer, analysts say the rush to buy back shares crimped development of new products, a prime reason that both companies are experiencing slow revenue growth.</p><p>Despite the looming expiration of the patent for its best-selling drug,&nbsp;<a title=\"Recent and archival health news about Lipitor.\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/lipitor_drug/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\">Lipitor</a>, Pfizer spent more than $20 billion repurchasing shares from 2005 to 2010.</p><a title=\"Recent and archival health news about Lipitor.\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/health/diseasesconditionsandhealthtopics/lipitor_drug/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier\">Lipitor</a><p>“In that era, it wasn’t the best use of cash,” said Catherine Arnold, an analyst with Credit Suisse. “They should have been doing more to fix the company.”</p><p>Matthew Dodds, an analyst with Citigroup, said, “Zimmer has shown little appetite for acquisitions or diversification, yet they don’t sport a pipeline that can drive investor interest.”</p><p>Nevertheless, Zimmer is on track to repurchase $1 billion worth of its shares this year, double last year’s pace, and it actually borrowed money last quarter to achieve its goal.</p><p>In a statement, Zimmer said its bonus programs were “designed to pay for performance,” and that overall compensation strategy was “designed to align the interests of its employees and stockholders.” Zimmer is committed to research and development and the introduction of new products, the company said, adding that the factory closure in North Carolina, while difficult, “is in the best interest of the company’s stockholders.”</p><p>Pfizer declined to make an executive available to discuss its policy. But in a statement, the company said it “remains committed to returning capital to shareholders through share buybacks and dividend payments.”</p><p>As for the cut in research spending in February, Pfizer said it has “accelerated our research strategy and made important changes to concentrate our efforts to deliver the greatest medical and commercial impact.”</p><p>In a conference call with analysts this month, Pfizer’s chief executive, Ian C. Read, said his company would “continually look” for acquisitions that would increase revenue growth. But in deciding how to use the proceeds from recent asset sales, he said “the case to beat is share repurchase.”</p><p>Financial institutions, which bought back huge amounts of stock over the last decade at share prices far higher than they are today, do not seem to have learned their lesson either. JPMorgan Chase, for example, spent $4.4 billion repurchasing shares in the third quarter even as its stock fell more than 25 percent.</p><p>Jamie Dimon, the bank’s chief executive, actually apologized for the move last month, conceding: “It would have been wise to wait. We’re sorry.”</p>"

      "<p>Gov. Mark Dayton’s jobs summit last month was a remarkable example of the extraordinary collaboration taking place between business leaders and government officials to rebuild Minnesota’s jobs machine.</p><p>Historically, Minnesota has benefited from diverse industries including agriculture and food products, financial and professional services, health care, education, and high-technology manufacturing that allowed us to offset economic downturns. But after outpacing the nation for 30 years in job creation, Minnesota has fallen behind since 2003.</p><p>The 800 business and civic leaders who jammed into the ballroom at the Crowne Plaza in St. Paul engaged in serious discussions about how to stimulate job growth in Minnesota and re-create the Minnesota Miracle. This convergence of business and government leaders was a welcome contrast to the political gridlock that shut down state government in July.</p><p>At the summit the governor wasted no time in making his position clear: “It is the task of private enterprise to create jobs and wealth,” he said. “The government’s role is to create the environment and rules that make that possible.” Dayton put substance behind his pledge, announcing a $100 million fund for small business loans, distributed through 300 Minnesota community banks.</p><p>These efforts are none too soon. Alarmed by declining job trends, a group of leading CEOs and civic leaders formed the Itasca Jobs Task Force in 2009. Chaired by Ken Powell of General Mills and Marilyn Carlson Nelson of Carlson Companies, their 2010 report highlighted three strategic initiatives to improve the region’s competitiveness:</p><p>•Address the cost of doing business.</p><p>•Develop a vision, strategy, and approach for regional economic development.</p><p>•Enhance entrepreneurship and innovation.</p><p>To implement the report’s recommendations, Itasca formed a team of 60 participants, chaired by HealthPartners CEO Mary Brainerd. “For us, this is the most important thing we have been part of,” Brainerd said. “The commitment to a thriving community is really extraordinary.”</p><p>In addition, the Minnesota Business Partnership, which includes the heads of 150 local companies, formed three task forces of its own under the leadership of Ecolab CEO Doug Baker Jr. The partnership made concrete recommendations to the governor and Legislature regarding fiscal policy, health care, and education.</p><p>Also last month, 12 large companies joined with local municipalities to launch Greater MSP, with Baker as its chairman. A $2 million budget was established, with 70 percent from the 12 companies and the remainder from government units. Its mission is to recruit out-of-state and international companies to locate in Minnesota and to encourage local companies to expand locally. Michael Langley was hired as executive director, coming from Pittsburgh, where he led a comparable initiative.</p><p>These remarkable efforts are a testament to the quality of Minnesota’s leaders. Our state is blessed to be home to 20 Fortune 500 companies led by progressive leaders who understand that Minnesota’s quality of life and a well-educated workforce are essential to their success — and necessary to offset negatives like high taxes, high cost of living and weather.</p><p>Historically, Minnesota’s strength has been the quality of its workforce. Thanks to efforts put in place 50 years ago, the Twin Cities leads the nation with 93 percent of citizens holding high school diplomas, and is third in bachelor’s or graduate degrees with 37 percent. Ecolab’s Baker notes, “Ultimately, the education and skills of the workforce are MSP’s competitive advantages.”</p><p>But this advantage appears to be at risk. The Itasca report forecast a gap by 2030 of 322,000 skilled workers that could constrain the region’s growth. Bush Foundation President Peter Hutchinson notes that these other efforts will be in vain unless the region has the right workforce. He favors investments in infrastructure, K-12 schools, and higher education.</p><p>“It’s a painful reality that many of the 215,000 Minnesotans without jobs don’t have the education needed for the new economy,” said Steven Rosenstone, the new chancellor of Minnesota State Colleges and Universities (MnSCU). “By 2018, 78 percent of Minnesota’s jobs will require postsecondary education.”</p><p>Minnesota has its challenges. But given the remarkably committed leaders we have today, I feel confident that these new initiatives will bear fruit and create the second Minnesota Miracle.</p><hr><p><a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/business/134145133.html\">Originially posted: StarTribune<br>November 19, 2011</a></p><a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/business/134145133.html\">Originially posted: StarTribune<br>November 19, 2011</a><br>"

This raises the question of how companies can develop this next generation of leaders. Historically, large companies have focused on development of a select group of leaders, usually drawn from the headquarters country, based on processes that favor selection over long-term development.</p><p>These new requirements impact these processes dramatically. Global companies will require hundreds, even thousands, of collaborative leaders effective in working in cross-cultural teams based in multiple locations.

Emerging research by EQ pioneer Daniel Goleman and others has shown that for leaders with IQs above 120, EQ rather than IQ is the distinguishing factor in successful leadership. Unlike IQ, EQ — which is based on high levels of self-awareness, self-control, social awareness, and relationship skills — can be improved.

You need&nbsp;<em>to serve something greater than yourself</em>.</p><em>Why</em><em>purpose</em><em>power</em><em>prestige</em><em>money</em><em>to serve something greater than yourself</em><p>Leaders whose goal is the quest for&nbsp;<em>power</em>&nbsp;over others, unlimited&nbsp;<em>wealth</em>, or the&nbsp;<em>fame</em>&nbsp;that comes with<em>success</em>&nbsp;tend to look to others to gain satisfaction, and often appear self-centered and egotistical. They start to believe their own press. As leaders, they believe the institution can’t succeed without them.</p><em>power</em><em>wealth</em><em>fame</em><em>success</em><p>Few leaders start out seeking only money, power, and prestige. Along the way, the rewards—bonus checks, press, perks, and stock appreciation—fuel increasing desires for more. This creates a deep desire to keep it going, often driven by desires to overcome narcissistic wounds from childhood. Many times, this desire is so strong that&nbsp;<em>leaders breach the ethical standards that previously governed their conduct</em>, which can be bizarre and even illegal. As Novartis chairman Daniel Vasella said: “For many of us the idea of being a&nbsp;<em>successful manager</em>—leading the company from peak to peak, delivering the goods quarter to quarter—is an intoxicating one. It is a pattern of celebration leading to belief, leading to distortion. When you achieve good results, you are typically celebrated, and you being to believe that&nbsp;<em>the figure at the center of all that champagne-toasting is yourself</em>.”</p><em>leaders breach the ethical standards that previously governed their conduct</em><em>successful manager</em><em>the figure at the center of all that champagne-toasting is yourself</em><p>When leaders focus on&nbsp;<em>external gratification</em>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<em>inner satisfaction</em>, they lose their grounding. They reject&nbsp;<em>honest critics</em>&nbsp;who speak truth to power. Instead they surround themselves with<em>sycophants</em>&nbsp;who tell them what they want to hear. They can’t engage in honest dialogue; others learn not to confront them with reality.</p><em>external gratification</em><em>inner satisfaction</em><em>honest critics</em><em>sycophants</em><p>Many leaders get to the top by&nbsp;<em>imposing their will on others</em>, even&nbsp;<em>destroying people standing in their way</em>. When they reach the top, they may be paranoid that others are trying to knock them off their pedestal. Sometimes they develop an&nbsp;<em>impostor complex</em>, caused by deep insecurities that they are never&nbsp;<em>enough</em>.</p><em>imposing their will on others</em><em>destroying people standing in their way</em><em>impostor complex</em><em>enough</em><p>To prove they aren’t imposters, they drive so hard for perfection that they can’t acknowledge their failures. When confronted by them, they convince themselves and others that these problems are neither their fault nor their responsibility. Or they look for scapegoats to blame. Using their power, charisma, and communications skills, they force people to accept these distortions, causing entire organizations to lose touch with reality. At this stage, leaders are vulnerable to making big mistakes, such as violating the law. Their distortions convince them they are doing nothing wrong, or they rationalize that their deviations are acceptable to achieve a greater good.</p><p><em><strong>It’s lonely at the top, because leaders know they are ultimately responsible for the lives and fortunes of people</strong></em>. If they fail, many get deeply hurt. They often deny the burdens of loneliness, becoming&nbsp;<em>incapable of facing reality</em>. They shut down their inner voice, because it is too painful to confront or acknowledge; it may, however, appear in their dreams as they try to resolve conflicts rustling around inside their heads.</p><em><strong>It’s lonely at the top, because leaders know they are ultimately responsible for the lives and fortunes of people</strong></em><strong>It’s lonely at the top, because leaders know they are ultimately responsible for the lives and fortunes of people</strong><em>incapable of facing reality</em><p>Meanwhile, their work lives and personal lives get out of balance. They lose touch with those closest to them—their spouses, children, and friends—or co-opt them with their points of view. Eventually, they lose their capacity to think logically about important issues.</p><h2>Values-Centered Leadership</h2><p>Leading is high-stress work. There is no way to avoid the&nbsp;<em>constant challenges</em>. Leaders who move up have greater freedom to control their destinies, but also experience increased pressure and seduction. Leaders can avoid these pitfalls by devoting themselves to personal development that cultivates their inner compass, or&nbsp;<em>True North</em>.</p><em>constant challenges</em><em>True North</em><p>This requires reframing their leadership from being&nbsp;<em>heroes</em>&nbsp;to being&nbsp;<em>servants of the people they lead</em>. This requires introspection because many people get into leadership roles in response to their ego needs. It enables them to transition from seeking external gratification to finding internal satisfaction by making meaningful contributions through their leadership.</p><em>heroes</em><em>servants of the people they lead</em><p>Maintaining their equilibrium amid this stress requires&nbsp;<em>discipline</em>. Some people practice meditation or yoga to relieve stress; others find solace in prayer or walks; still others find relief through laughter, music, television, sports, and reading. Their choices don’t matter, as long as they&nbsp;<em>relieve stress</em>&nbsp;and<em>think more clearly about work and personal issues</em>.</p><em>discipline</em><em>relieve stress</em><em>think more clearly about work and personal issues</em><p><em><strong>Leaders need to seek out people who influence them in profound ways and stay connected to them</strong></em>. Often their&nbsp;<em>spouse</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>partner</em>&nbsp;knows them best. They aren’t impressed by titles, prestige, or wealth accumulation; instead, they worry that these outward symbols may be causing the loss of authenticity.</p><em><strong>Leaders need to seek out people who influence them in profound ways and stay connected to them</strong></em><strong>Leaders need to seek out people who influence them in profound ways and stay connected to them</strong><em>spouse</em><em>partner</em><p>Leaders also need&nbsp;<em>mentors</em>&nbsp;to advise them when facing difficult decisions—mentors who are honest and straight with them, defining reality and developing action plans. In addition,&nbsp;<em>intimate support groups</em>&nbsp;with whom leaders can share their life experiences, hopes, fears and challenges, are invaluable.

      "<p>It is fashionable these days to vilify leaders, from BP’s Tony Hayward to Wall Street bankers. When a problem arises, we look for the villain who caused it. Then we search for&nbsp;<em>the perfect leader</em>&nbsp;to guide us—only to find they have feet of clay.</p><em>the perfect leader</em><p>Instead we need&nbsp;<em>authentic leaders—</em>people who own their mistakes, acknowledge their faults, and always put the interests of their organizations ahead of self-interests. Young leaders need role models whose actions provide guidance for their leadership.</p><em>authentic leaders—</em><h4>Example 1: GM’s Ed Whitacre</h4><p>Only a year ago, General Motors emerged from bankruptcy. What a difference a year has made! GM is now solidly profitable, growing its revenues once again, retooling its lineup of automobiles, and enabling the U.S. government to recoup its bailout investment.</p><p>GM’s fall into bankruptcy was more like a steady decline over 50 years. When the end came in early 2009, President Obama had the courage to finance the company to bring it out of bankruptcy. And, he appointed a highly successful board chair in Ed Whitacre, who became CEO four months later. Whitacre was a successful telecommunications executive, chair and CEO of SBC who saved ATT from its demise.</p><p>Ed Whitacre’s remarkable leadership rapidly turned around GM.&nbsp;His one-year tenure marked a dramatic shift in the old way of doing business, as the days of redundant bureaucracy and disjointed innovation quickly ceased. Whitacre abandoned GM’s moribund committee system that protected executives from being accountable for results, and made clear, decisive decisions while challenging people to move much faster.</p><p>Whitacre even appeared in GM ads, heralding the new GM and challenging customers to give GM cars a try while offering them their money back if they weren’t satisfied. He got a break when Toyota ran into quality problems, but he moved quickly to take advantage of it by ramping up production rates and sales and marketing efforts.</p><p>Since turning over the CEO reins to successor Dan Akerson, Whitacre has received undeserved criticism for stepping down. But this was his intention. He noted, “It was my plan—to help return this company to greatness—and not stay a day beyond that.” He’s a man of his word, and he delivered on every promise and commitment he made.</p><h4>Example 2: Win Wallin</h4><table border=\"0\" align=\"right\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody><tr>\n<td>&nbsp;</td>\n</tr><td>&nbsp;</td><p>Another role model is Winston Wallin. Now in his mid-80s, Win is former CEO of Medtronic and my ex-boss. He had three distinguished careers—at Pillsbury, Medtronic, and the University of Minnesota. As a board member, Win made major contributions to the success of Cargill and Norwest Bank (now Wells Fargo). But his greatest legacy may be the Wallin Education Scholars, a program that enables thousands of high school students to attend colleges.</p><p>After graduating from UM, Win joined Pillsbury, where he spent 37 years, rising to president/COO. The Pillsbury board made a grievous error in not choosing him to succeed Bill Spoor as CEO.</p><p>Pillsbury’s loss was Medtronic’s gain. Win accepted the board’s request to be CEO in 1985. Medtronic was floundering, and Win soon recognized Medtronic’s future was at risk: Medtronic was blocked from entering the nascent implantable defibrillator market by a pioneering patent held by archrival Eli Lilly.</p><p>Win’s first act was to ask Medtronic pacemaker chief Bobby Griffin to launch a massive R&amp;D effort to get Medtronic into the defibrillator business. Win also recognized that the company was too reliant on pacemakers, in part due to several failed attempts at diversification. So he hired Dr. Glen Nelson as vice chairman in 1986; together they began to diversify Medtronic’s business.</p><p>When I joined Medtronic as president in 1989, it was the best move of my career. My first week on the job, Win told me, “Bill, don’t worry about the numbers for six months. Get out and learn the business from the top doctors.” That sent me on a quest to work with some of the world’s finest physicians by watching them implant everything from pacemakers to defibrillators.</p><p>Win retired from Medtronic in 1991, but he certainly didn’t retire from life. In addition to chairing Medtronic’s board, he joined five corporate boards where he provided invaluable advice. He also answered UM President Nils Hasselmo’s request to help turn around its struggling health sciences area.</p><p>In the 1990s, Win and his wife, Maxine, formed the Wallin Foundation, setting aside a major proportion of their gains from Medtronic stock. More than 3,000 students have benefitted from $26 million in scholarships.</p><p>Aspiring young leaders would do well to look to Win Wallin for a model of authentic leader and sustainable success.</p><h4>Leadership Ethics</h4><p>Today’s leaders need to be asking questions:&nbsp;How do we do business? What happens when you get asked for favors? You need to trust but you also need a&nbsp;<em>verification and compliance system.</em></p><em>verification and compliance system.</em><p>When there are any deviations, it should be a zero-tolerance policy, with no second chance. If you make&nbsp;<em>mistakes</em>, you should get a second chance. But on questions of company values, there is no second chance. Everybody needs to know that. We need to vet, not just criticize, people who violate ethical standards. We also need to uphold leaders who seek to make a difference.</p><em>mistakes</em><p>To get through a crisis, leaders need an outside team.&nbsp;<em>It starts with having one person with whom you can be entirely open.</em>That person for me is my wife, Penny. If I get too high on myself, she pulls me back down; and if I get down, she gives me a practical view of things. I also meet with a men’s group weekly to talk about issues and challenges. And when I have tough questions, I have mentors like Warren Bennis and David Gergen who I can call up.</p><em>It starts with having one person with whom you can be entirely open.</em><p>It’s easy to fall into group-think.&nbsp;You tend to talk about the same issues, and tend to think about them the same way. It’s vital to have outside exposure, an external team that brings&nbsp;<em>perspective</em>.</p><em>perspective</em><p>Leading with ethics and values is the best way to build an organization and the right way to sustain success.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

Mark Dayton’s jobs summit was a hard, but hopeful, look at what Minnesota might be.&nbsp;</p><p>At Tuesday’s session, about 800 people talking mostly about the positive things Minnesota has to sell to those looking to run successful businesses.  “If we have been slipping,” said Bill George, the former chief executive officer of Medtronic and now a professor of management at Harvard, “we do still have the resources to become a national leader in creating jobs.”&nbsp;</p><p>George spoke of the “quality of the people and the civility of the workforce” in Minnesota. And he praised the state’s core strengths: health care and education.  George’s comments, and many more like them from other leaders, weren’t the only good vibes being felt at the Crowne Plaza Hotel in downtown St. Paul. There was no talk of a Vikings stadium, which seemed to lift the spirits of everyone in attendance.&nbsp;</p><p>A couple of clouds <br>But then, around noon, two clouds drifted over the otherwise hopeful setting. Cloud One:  Just across the hall from a space dubbed the Innovation Room, where creative product displays of Minnesota companies were on display, the St. Paul Rotary Club was holding its meeting. The Rotarians’ guest speaker?  The Vikings’ Lester Bagley, who was talking about the need for Minnesota to help the team build a stadium in Arden Hills. This was proof that no matter where they go, Minnesota leaders are going to be tailed by the Vikings “issue.”&nbsp;</p><br><p>Cloud Two: Michael Mandelbaum — co-author with Thomas Friedman of a top-selling book “That Used to Be Us: How America Fell Behind in the World It Invented and How We Can Come Back” — offered the keynote address at the gov’s big event.  Mandelbaum is an American foreign policy professor at Johns Hopkins and is supposed to be one of the country’s great thinkers. That may be. But he also can suck the hope out of a room filled with earnest people.&nbsp;</p><p>A downer, nonpartisan message <br>This much should be said for Mandelbaum. He is nonpartisan. In his long speech, he said things that offended Democrats and Republicans.    Mandelbaum offended Democrats by saying that in order to attack the national debt, the government “will have to break promises it made” to people expecting to receive pensions, Social Security and Medicare.  He offended Republicans by saying that “taxes need to be raised” and the nation needs to understand “climate change exists.” But mostly what he did was go on and on about what a mess the country is in.&nbsp;</p><br><p>The infrastructure’s falling apart. Kids aren’t being educated. Universities aren’t being funded at necessary levels. The political system “is not working.”  On a day that people had charged into St. Paul looking to take on the state’s economic and image woes, this lunchtime talk was such a downer that people were hoping they’d be served antidepressants for dessert.   Mandelbaum did try to resuscitate the crowd in the dying-gasp minutes of his address. With a straight face, he claimed that the book he and Friedman wrote is “an optimistic book.”   The hope, he said, is to be found in the “grass roots” of the country, not at the top, and noted that America’s past shows it’s a country that can “master challenges.” Finally, he and Friedman said, they’ve got the answer for the political woes.&nbsp;They believe an independent candidate needs to run for president, “a radical centrist.” He didn’t mention Jesse Ventura as a possible candidate.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, however, the tone of the summit was refreshingly positive. Despite Dayton making “jobs, jobs, jobs” the emphasis of his first year in office, there was little in this conference that was about immediate jobs. Instead, it was an attempt to be futuristic, without being goofy.&nbsp;</p><p>Small businesses getting some help<br>“It would be easy to be all talk, no action,” said Neil Crocker, president of Schaefer Ventilation, a privately held company in Sauk Rapids.  Crocker praised some of the things government does to help Minnesota’s smaller businesses, describing his company as “a heavy user of state services.” Many of the company’s 50 employees, he noted, were trained at state colleges and universities. The company also has “taken advantage of the state’s trade office” in creating markets overseas. But he did note that business taxes in the state are high. “We have to avoid killing the golden goose,” he said.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Speaker after speaker talked of how Minnesota’s competitive advantage always has been its educated workforce and made the point that education will become increasingly important. “Many of us are not aware of how different the world is today than five years ago, 10 years ago,” Crocker said. “I get a kick out of those who talk about job creation being tied to manufacturing recovery. It’s not happening. That ship has sailed.” That means Minnesota will have to offer more people a better education than ever before. Here’s how University of Minnesota President Eric Kaler put it: “People don’t always come to Minnesota because of the weather. They come because of smart people.”&nbsp;</p><p>Employers and educators both talked of education as the key cog in the state’s future. “It’s a painful reality that many of the 215,000 Minnesotans without jobs don’t have the education needed for the new economy,” said Steven Rosenstone, chancellor of Minnesota State Colleges and Universities. He noted that “78 percent of all jobs in Minnesota by 2018 will require some postsecondary education.” At most events in recent months in Minnesota, this would have led to a partisan, finger-pointing political fight about the need to invest more in all levels of education.&nbsp;</p><p>Rep. Matt Dean praises effort <br>But this event didn’t collapse into petty bickering, in part because most Republican legislative leaders were no-shows and in part because Dayton started the day by saying the summit was to be about “ideas, not ideologies.” Rep. Matt Dean, majority leader and the only Republican legislative leader at the summit, seemed to be caught up in the spirit of the event.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dean was a member of a panel devoted to talking about how Minnesota should “brand” itself. The thought, by the way, seems to be that Minnesota needs some sort of unified “brand image.” Currently, the Department of Tourism uses “Explore Minnesota.” The state’s license plates read: “Land of 10,000 Lakes.” A lot of people inside and outside the state seem to think the motto is an old Hamm’s Beer jingle, “Land of Sky Blue Waters.” So there’s a study going on. The brand people, by the way, really like how Michigan government and business organizations have gotten together around the theme “Pure Michigan.” Hmmm. Tongue in cheek, Dean suggested branding that reflects the personality of our population: “Not so bad.”&nbsp;</p><p>But Dean, with sincerity, praised Dayton for bringing together so many people looking to do good for the state. “It’s important to lead from the top and spread a positive message,” Dean said. Other than the keynote address and the lurking stadium issue, there was a positive aura at the summit, although no one suggested what lies ahead will be easy. “I don’t think there’s an easy road ahead for our state,” the governor said at the end of the day. “But it’s a road we must take.” He promised to have the beginning of an action plan in place today. Presumably, then he can get back to the serious work of solving the Vikings’ stadium dilemma.&nbsp;</p>"

Show you’re an authentic leader who truly cares about staffers and the company, and you’ll get your employees’ best efforts.</p><p>•<strong>&nbsp;Stick to your principles.&nbsp;</strong>That’s the way to lead, says Bill George, former CEO of medical device maker&nbsp;Medtronic&nbsp;(<a rel=\"/StockSymbol.axd?symbol=MDT\" href=\"http://news.investors.com/Article.aspx?id=589538&amp;p=1\">MDT</a>) and now a Harvard professor. Money, fame and power can throw people off of the foundation of values that got them to the top. Instead, remain genuine to who you are, he says.</p><strong>&nbsp;Stick to your principles.&nbsp;</strong><a rel=\"/StockSymbol.axd?symbol=MDT\" href=\"http://news.investors.com/Article.aspx?id=589538&amp;p=1\">MDT</a><p>•<strong>&nbsp;Be accountable.&nbsp;</strong>When that starts with the leader, it will filter through the rest of the organization. Take responsibility for your actions, and you’ll maintain your values. “Research shows that the leaders who are the most grounded are the best leaders,” George told IBD. “Successful leaders are vulnerable, admit mistakes and then find ways to fix them.”</p><strong>&nbsp;Be accountable.&nbsp;</strong><p>•<strong>&nbsp;Start at the top.&nbsp;</strong>Authenticity from the group’s leaders breeds trust. A Maritz Research poll shows just 7% of U.S. workers see management’s actions as consistent with their words. “We need our people to be engaged, trusted leaders,” said Lynn Lieber, a San Francisco-based employment lawyer and legal adviser to compliance training provider Workplace Answers. “You see companies like&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;(<a rel=\"/StockSymbol.axd?symbol=AAPL\" href=\"http://news.investors.com/Article.aspx?id=589538&amp;p=1\">AAPL</a>) where people had huge amounts of trust in their leaders.”</p><strong>&nbsp;Start at the top.&nbsp;</strong><a rel=\"/StockSymbol.axd?symbol=AAPL\" href=\"http://news.investors.com/Article.aspx?id=589538&amp;p=1\">AAPL</a><p>•<strong>&nbsp;Form panels.&nbsp;</strong>George calls them True North Groups, the title of his latest book. They’re small sets of people who know each other well enough to give honest opinions. Such a group serves as a sounding board for each member. “The people trust each other and are willing to be open,” said George.</p><strong>&nbsp;Form panels.&nbsp;</strong><p>George’s group helped him realize he was drifting away from his base values when he was in line to become CEO at aerospace firm&nbsp;Honeywell International&nbsp;(<a rel=\"/StockSymbol.axd?symbol=HON\" href=\"http://news.investors.com/Article.aspx?id=589538&amp;p=1\">HON</a>). He left in 1989 and had a successful run as Medtronic’s CEO.</p><a rel=\"/StockSymbol.axd?symbol=HON\" href=\"http://news.investors.com/Article.aspx?id=589538&amp;p=1\">HON</a><p>•<strong>&nbsp;Look inward.&nbsp;</strong>George says leaders need a way to be introspective about how they’re operating. He meditates twice a day. Others write journals or talk to someone close to them. That gives you time to reflect on how your values affect decisions. “If you go, go, go all the time, you’re not real grounded,” he said.</p><strong>&nbsp;Look inward.&nbsp;</strong><p>•<strong>&nbsp;Show you care.&nbsp;</strong>Employees will see you as genuine if you prove you’re into their well-being. When Lieber ran a company, she would write thank-you notes to her people. Many told her that was the most important praise they received. Then, when she needed them to stay late, they were likelier to go the extra mile. “Even a little bit goes a long way,” she said.</p><strong>&nbsp;Show you care.&nbsp;</strong><p>•<strong>&nbsp;Spread the wealth.&nbsp;</strong>Give credit to the rest of your people. Steve Jobs did so with his resignation letter as Apple’s CEO in August. “Then they’re inspired and will go to the mat for you,” Lieber said.</p><strong>&nbsp;Spread the wealth.&nbsp;</strong><p>•<strong>&nbsp;Know your people.&nbsp;</strong>Find a way to truly understand the issues your employees face and get to know them, George says. Manage by walking around. “You can’t create an authentic workplace by sitting in the corner office,” he said.</p><strong>&nbsp;Know your people.&nbsp;</strong><p>CEO Howard Schultz walks into his&nbsp;Starbucks&nbsp;(<a rel=\"/StockSymbol.axd?symbol=SBUX\" href=\"http://news.investors.com/Article.aspx?id=589538&amp;p=1\">SBUX</a>) stores unannounced to see how things are going. George learned about issues doctors faced with Medtronic’s products by observing 700 procedures. “It’s going out and engaging the workforce,” he said. “You’ve got to be out there with the troops.”</p><a rel=\"/StockSymbol.axd?symbol=SBUX\" href=\"http://news.investors.com/Article.aspx?id=589538&amp;p=1\">SBUX</a><p>•<strong>&nbsp;Lay out rules.&nbsp;</strong>Set up a code of conduct. Provide training around it that’s specific to your outfit, Lieber says, and talk about it when issues of conduct arise. That also impresses regulators if problems crop up. “You’re showing that you’re acting in good faith, and that this is reflected in everything you do,” she said.</p><strong>&nbsp;Lay out rules.&nbsp;</strong>"

George also repeated the mantra, “My generation messed up.” He ascribed the entire economic downturn and turmoil in recent years to a failure of leadership, especially from Wall Street.&nbsp;</p><p>When asked about the Occupy Wall Street movement now spreading all over the United States, Bill George frowned and said, “They are holding up mirrors for us, and asking: ‘do you like what you see in it?’ I don’t like what I see. That’s myself…that I don’t like.”&nbsp;</p><p>Ever since the first group of young people gathered near Wall Street in mid-September, the protest has been criticized for being fluid, fractured, lacking a clear goal, and aimed at the wrong target. Yet, after more than a month of demonstrations and protestors “occupying” more than 450 locations in the U.S., “leaders” in the country eventually realized that they have to face the truth: something is going wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>It is easy to understand that from the Wall Street black-ties’ point of view, a bunch of youngsters dancing, painting, and playing musical instruments near the Financial District is pure fandangle. But now, with hundreds of thousands of people voicing the same concerns, the message is clear: economic and social inequality has increasingly become a problem.&nbsp;</p><p>The income ratio in the U.S. was 14.5 to 1 in 2010, which almost doubled the ratio of 1968 (7.69 to 1). Today, the top 20% of Americans are earning roughly half of the nation’s income, whereas 15% of the population below the poverty line is only making 3.4%. While protestors’ claims that “1% of the people have 99% of the wealth” may not be accurate, the anger and depression among the “have-nots” are real.&nbsp;</p><p>There is no widely agreed-upon definition of “corporate greed”, which the Wall Street demonstrators are protesting against. Analogously, “true north” can also vary from individual to individual. In the book, Bill George described “true north” as a person’s set of values and goals which cannot be sacrificed. However, each person’s values and goals can differ greatly.&nbsp;</p><p>On October 5, 2011, the world became sentimental when people learned of Steve Jobs’ death. The business genius and role-model received universal acclaim, not only because Apple’s stock price had been rocketing, but also due to the fact that iPhones and iPads have transformed the lives of an entire generation. Together with Apple fans, business leaders, media and scholars began to compare Apple, Inc. and Microsoft, and cited Apple as the winner in this marathon of sustainable corporate development.&nbsp;</p><p>It might be true judging from the companies’ share prices. However, we may want to pause before we draw the same conclusion from the viewpoint of leadership. Both Apple and Microsoft have built milestones during the past decades. On one hand, after Bill Gates’ retirement, Microsoft has been marching forward steadily, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has supported hundreds of development projects in over 100 countries. On the other hand, we only know that Steve Jobs never brought Apple’s charitable branch back after shutting it down during the company’s difficult years.&nbsp;</p><p>Did Steve Jobs follow his internal compass? Sure. Bill George himself sees Steve as a giant.&nbsp;</p><p>People may argue that it is unfair to judge Steve Jobs solely on publicly-made monetary donations. And please don’t get me wrong – I am not accusing the deceased. My point is, everyone’s “true north” is distinct, and society as a whole cannot rely solely on the philanthropy of these business leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>Narrowing income disparities should be the government’s responsibility. After all, the rise of corporate stars such as Apple and Microsoft alone will not result in a stable and booming society. People aren’t protesting against Wall Street because they can’t afford to buy an iPhone or a PC. They are protesting because the door of opportunity has been slammed in their face.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;He Shifei is a Chinese freelance journalist currently living in the U.S. Her research interests include government, politics and policy studies.</p>"

      "<p>YOUR LEADERSHIP DOLLARS AT WORK: With the start of the Fall Semester the undergraduate “True North”mentoring circles have started again. This September marks the 4th mentoring circle where undergraduates and theirBeta Psi alumnus mentor meet to discuss Brother Bill George’s 5th chapter in his book “True North.” This chapterdiscusses values and principles. The groups are exploring the reality that your values and your principles are the basis ofyour authenticity. Before people can believe in you, you must believe in yourself. And before you can believe in yourselfyou must be firmly grounded in your own values and principles. These have been formed and forged through theexperiences you have had in your life so far. You may change, add to or re-prioritize these as you move forward withyour life but take some time now to think about your basic beliefs at this stage in your life. The group discussion so farhas been engaging and enlightening for both the mentees and the mentors.</p>"

This serves as the basis for his new book,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/True-North-Groups-Leadership-Development/dp/1609940075\">True North Groups</a></em>, coauthored with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.truenorthgroups.com/blog\">Doug Baker</a>, who led HR at Medtronic. The new book is about how to create a great personal board of directors or tribe, along with all the norms, practices, and feedback mechanisms to support your leadership (and life). Bill and Doug should know; they’ve been meeting and working with a small group weekly since 1975.</p><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/True-North-Groups-Leadership-Development/dp/1609940075\">True North Groups</a></em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/True-North-Groups-Leadership-Development/dp/1609940075\">True North Groups</a><a href=\"http://www.truenorthgroups.com/blog\">Doug Baker</a><p>It is a very timely book. In&nbsp;<em>True North Groups</em>, Bill and Doug provide an extremely insightful and practical roadmap for how you can create your own ecosystem for mutual support, feedback, development, and, ultimately, lifelong learning collaborators. Here are Bill’s responses to my questions about the book, and their top lessons learned through their experiences and three years of research for this book:<br><strong><br>What is a True North Group and how do you select the right people to be in it?</strong></p><em>True North Groups</em><br><strong><br>What is a True North Group and how do you select the right people to be in it?</strong><br><p>A True North Group is a small, intimate group of peers who talk openly about personal and professional issues as well as their beliefs, values, and principles in a confidential setting. The idea for these groups grew out of the growing movement to form small affinity groups to deal with everything from chemical dependency, religious study, and personal grief to book and cooking groups. The big difference with True North Groups is that they provide forums for diverse sets of people to share highly personal issues and beliefs without requiring any specific affinity like chemical dependency or religious belief.</p><p>These groups provide a safe, confidential place where people can share their experiences, challenges, and frustrations and get honest feedback. At various times a True North Group functions as a nurturer, a grounding rod, a truth teller, and a mirror. At their best, members serve each other as caring coaches and thoughtful mentors.</p><p>To form a True North Group, gather together a small group of people who are compatible and respectful of each other. In selecting members, it is essential to hold to rigorous standards. Don’t compromise; one or two ill-fitting members can easily reduce the feelings of trust and openness. Solid members lead to better, deeper discussions of significant topics.</p><p><strong>How is a True North Group similar to or different than a personal board of directors?</strong></p><strong>How is a True North Group similar to or different than a personal board of directors?</strong><p>Typically, a personal board of directors is formed to help an individual with professional issues. In contrast, a True North Group is a two-way street, in which members help each other and become both givers and receivers of constructive feedback and ideas. There are no limits to the issues raised in a True North Group, as long as they enable the members to discuss more personal issues.</p><p><strong>Who is in your True North Group and what do they add to your life?</strong></p><strong>Who is in your True North Group and what do they add to your life?</strong><p>I formed my first True North Group with Doug Baker and two other men in 1975. Over the years the group has expanded to eight men, including five business people, two lawyers, and an architect. This group has helped me become more self-aware and open, and enabled me to understand my blind spots. Their support has given me the courage to take risks with significant challenges, and learn how to give and receive feedback in a non-judgmental way.</p><p>When my wife Penny was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996, they helped me see that I was in denial that her disease could be fatal, which in turn was preventing me from giving her the emotional support she needed to get through this very difficult time in her life. They knew that both my mother and my fiancée died of cancer and that my fears were blocking me from being a good support person to her. Their help enabled me to stop trying to “fix” her disease — which of course I couldn’t — and just be there for her.</p><p><strong>How and when did you decide to put the group together in the first place? Did you start with a formal structure or was it more informal at first?</strong></p><strong>How and when did you decide to put the group together in the first place? Did you start with a formal structure or was it more informal at first?</strong><p>The original four members of the group attended a three-day retreat; it built some strong bonds that we wanted to continue. We decided to get together each week to carry on our discussions. Believe it or not, we have met every Wednesday morning from 7:15-8:30 a.m. for the past 36 years.</p><p>Fearing that we could drift off into social or political discussions, we agreed upon a format of substantive programs that one of us would bring the group for two consecutive sessions on a rotating basis. We began by discussing our life stories, the early events in our lives that helped shape and influence us. We learned that often these earlier events, especially in relationship to our parents, were getting in our way of being fully present and comfortable with ourselves. These discussions were unique in our lives, so we wanted to continue them regularly.</p><p><strong>How did your group help you think through the decision of leaving Honeywell to go back to Medtronic?</strong></p><strong>How did your group help you think through the decision of leaving Honeywell to go back to Medtronic?</strong><p>In 1989, after long periods of denial, I finally acknowledged that I wasn’t happy in my work at Honeywell, although I was one of two candidates to become CEO. So I took the issue to my True North Group. They were the ones who helped me acknowledge that I was moving away from being a values-centered leader to engaging in a contest to become CEO of Honeywell, while I wasn’t passionate about the business I was responsible for. They gave me the encouragement to go back to Medtronic, where I had turned down three times the opportunity to become president and chief operating officer. I got very excited about the company’s mission of restoring people to full life and health, and felt that this mission was something that I could align with. My 13 years with Medtronic became the most important of my career.</p><p><strong>During the first few meetings with your group, how should the conversation go and what should members leave with?</strong></p><strong>During the first few meetings with your group, how should the conversation go and what should members leave with?</strong><p>In the book, Doug Baker and I outline a program for the first 12 sessions of your group, as well as more than 30 ideas for additional program topics. We recommend starting by sharing your life stories and the people and experiences that have had the greatest impact on your lives, so that people can get to know each other on a personal basis. In the following session, people should share times they have lost their way or deviated from their values and their True North. In the third session, which may be the most important of all, people share the greatest crucibles in their lives, what they learned from them, and how those earlier life experiences may be impacting their lives today. Members come away from the session with a deep sense of acceptance by others and the realization that they are not alone in facing great challenges.</p><p><strong>What other resources have you found useful in developing this system?</strong></p><strong>What other resources have you found useful in developing this system?</strong><p>Doug Baker and I spent three years researching small groups, talking to scholars like Harvard University Professor Robert Putnam, author of&nbsp;<em>Bowling Alone</em>&nbsp;(which our group studied and discussed for several weeks) and&nbsp;<em>American Grace</em>, Dr. Daniel Goleman, creator of emotional intelligence (EQ), religious leader Bill Hybels of Willow Creek Church in Chicago, leaders of the Forum of the Young Presidents Organization, 12-step group leaders, and other experts in small groups. With the help of researcher Jane Cavanaugh, we conducted formal interviews with 52 members of True North Groups.</p><em>Bowling Alone</em><em>American Grace</em><p>The group norms of trust, confidentiality, openness, and non-judgmental feedback emanated naturally from our original group. When I was creating my course on “Authentic Leadership Development” at Harvard Business School, which also used peer facilitators rather than faculty to lead the groups, I decided to codify the important norms of the group and have all participants sign the Members Contract at their first meeting. This contract is included in our new book because we believe it is essential for group members to agree upon the group’s norms at the outset. Over the past seven years, more than 1,500 MBAs and executives at Harvard Business School have participated in True North Groups through the 12-week course. For many of them, the experience has been transformative.</p><p><a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/09/true_north_groups.html\"> </a></p><a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/09/true_north_groups.html\"> </a><hr><p><a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/09/true_north_groups.html\"> Harvard Business Review – September 13, 2011</a></p><a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/cs/2011/09/true_north_groups.html\"> Harvard Business Review – September 13, 2011</a>"

      "<p>FORTUNE — About an hour into a leadership class at Columbia Business School, all 50-odd students were sitting rail-straight with their eyes closed. A blonde research associate with the slightest hint of a German accent cooed instructions at the front of the class. “Notice the sensation of your shoes,” he said.</p><p>Personal Leadership &amp; Success, which is taught by leadership expert Hitendra Wadhwa, is considered one of the “softer” offerings at Columbia, especially when compared to “hard” courses such as finance. The idea behind it is that good leadership begins with self-knowledge, hence the meditation exercise.</p><p>It may seem far out, but there are similar classes at business schools across the country. Stanford has offered a class called “Touchy-Feely” since 1966. And a class at Harvard Business School takes this idea of self-knowledge through group learning a step further.</p><p><strong>Recreating the community group</strong></p><strong>Recreating the community group</strong><p>The class, developed by former Medtronic (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=MDT\">MDT</a>) CEO and Harvard management professor Bill George, runs on the premise that groups of business-minded leaders can offer better leadership guidance than other networks, including family and friends. For this class, Harvard MBAs from different backgrounds are put into small groups where they complete coursework together and share deeply personal experiences.</p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=MDT\">MDT</a><p>Those shared experiences can fill an unmet need for community. Americans have become less social, George argues in his recently published book&nbsp;<em>True North Groups</em>. He cites the work of fellow Harvard professor Robert Putnam, whose research has shown that Americans’ participation in groups outside of work, such as rotary clubs or religious groups, has plummeted. According to Putnam’s research, the number of people attending meetings of any kind of club in the U.S. dropped by 58% from 1975 to 2000.</p><em>True North Groups</em><p>That’s where some business schools are starting to step in, and students are responding. Personal Leadership &amp; Success is one of the top 10 most popular electives for second-year MBA students at Columbia out of about 200 elective courses. Since 2008, over 600 students have applied every year for the 240 spots in Bill George’s class at Harvard (George now teaches a version for executives). This year, the Personal Leadership &amp; Success&nbsp;program for MBAs is expanding to take on 60 more students per year.</p><p>Some students say they are attracted to these kinds of courses because they feel like they are learning to lead in a vacuum. According to Rye Barcott, a Duke Energy (<a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=DUK\">DUK</a>) employee and Harvard Business School alum who took George’s class, the problem with many leaders today has little to do with their ability to crunch numbers, but rather a lack of values. “When you think about the biggest failures of corporate executives, they’re not necessarily technical failures, but ethical ones, ” Barcott says.</p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=DUK\">DUK</a><p>Programs like George’s class can help sharpen those ethics in future executives, says HBS alum and film executive Peter Bisanz: “I think that if our business leaders had insight into their own strengths and weaknesses, we would not have had the excessive greed that would have led to the financial crisis.”</p><p>Granted, both of these men were star students in the class and they believe in the methodology. But they both opened up to their peers in ways that may seem, at first glance, out of place in a business school setting.</p><p>The crux of George’s class is the students’ identification of a “crucible” moment, described in True North Groups as sharing with their groups “the singular experience that has tested you to the limits and impacted your life.” Some choose to open up in front of everyone, and these crucible moments can be intense — one person stood up and came out as a homosexual in front of the whole class, Bisanz says. Bisanz himself shared his experience with alcoholism.</p><p>It can be tough to have the kind of intimate interactions with personal friends that are necessary to grow as a leader, George argues in his book. Barcott agrees: “How do you bring up what the crucible moment is in your life without sounding like a tool?”</p><p>The program is no stand-in for therapy though, George insists, and some topics should stay out of these discussions. For example, in his book, he refers to a married couple in a True North group that wanted to talk about issues they had been having as swingers. It was disruptive.</p><p>But students likely to be at Harvard Business school could use the self-reflection a True North group requires, perhaps more than anybody, says Bisanz. “A lot of them haven’t had to be subjected to deep personal examination of their lives,” he says, because their paths have led to a top business school, so they’ve been pretty successful by most standards. But he thinks that makes business-oriented soul searching even more necessary. “When those people are tried and tested, they’re going to have to decide who they are and what they believe in.”</p><p><strong>A generation in search of purpose?</strong></p><strong>A generation in search of purpose?</strong><p>This idea that your beliefs should guide your career resonates among younger students and employees. Take Ben Austin, one of the students in Wadhwa’s class at Columbia. He used to work for film crews in Hollywood, fetching lattes, he jokes, but actually scoping out promising films at festivals. He hopes Wadhwa’s class will help him hone his sense of purpose and match that to his career goals. He isn’t so much looking for a job as a skill set, he says.</p><p>Millennials tend to, on the whole, crave jobs with a greater purpose. In a survey by consulting firm Mercer, young jobseekers ranked a company’s good reputation as one of the most important draws for a job, although salary still held the No. 1 spot. More than other workers, “Millennials are looking for a value congruence — it’s very important for them that the company they work for reflects their values,” says Jason Jeffay, a senior partner at Mercer consulting firm.</p><p>Clearly, that’s not true for all young people. Plenty of MBAs are strictly salary-driven, and both George’s and Wadhwa’s classes are electives, so they select for a population that’s searching for this kind of guidance. It’s unclear whether coursework like this could ever be mandatory, George says.</p><p><strong>When work and personal life become one</strong></p><strong>When work and personal life become one</strong><p>At its core, these courses try to teach “social intelligence,” otherwise known as compassion mixed with common sense. Being a decent, fulfilled person will help you become a better leader and manager, the thinking goes.</p><p>In truth, the business and personal worlds are collapsing in on each other. Many of us carry work with us wherever we go and spend more time with colleagues as the workday grows longer and longer. So it makes sense that business schools are turning into places where students want to learn how to be good at life in general.</p><p>Ben Austin said as much. He suggested that this article open with a description of the students meditating, then continue to describe how no, this wasn’t a scene at a temple of worship but rather [dramatic pause] “Columbia Business School: a temple of commerce.”</p><p>Austin has a point. The lines between where we go for moral guidance and where we go to learn how to balance a budget are growing blurrier these days.</p><hr><p>Orginially Posted on <a href=\"http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/09/14/the-church-of-b-school/\">Fortune.com on September 15, 2011</a></p><a href=\"http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/09/14/the-church-of-b-school/\">Fortune.com on September 15, 2011</a>"

The idea for these groups grew out of the growing movement to form small affinity groups to deal with everything from chemical dependency, religious study and personal grief to book and cooking groups. The big difference with True North Groups is that they provide forums for diverse sets of people to share highly personal issues and beliefs without requiring any specific affinity like chemical dependency or religious belief.</p><strong>Bill George:</strong><p>These groups provide a safe, confidential place where people can share their experiences, challenges and frustrations and get honest feedback. At various times a True North Group functions as a nurturer, a grounding rod, a truth teller and a mirror. At their best, members serve each other as caring coaches and thoughtful mentors.</p><p>True North Groups help people grow as human beings and leaders, as they learn to accept themselves and their strengths and weaknesses and gain confidence that others accept them for who they are. True North Groups provide the feedback that enable people to understand their blind spots, open up hidden areas and gain a deeper understanding of themselves. They offer unique environments for people to develop self-awareness, self-compassion and authenticity, and the confidence to navigate difficult situations in their life and work.</p><p>To form a True North Group, gather together a small group of people who are compatible and respectful of each other. In selecting members, it is essential to hold to rigorous standards and not to compromise as one or two ill-fitting members can easily reduce the feelings of trust and openness. Solid members lead to better, deeper discussions of significant topics.</p><p><strong>PS:</strong>&nbsp;How is a True North Group similar to or different from a personal board of directors?</p><strong>PS:</strong><p><strong>BG:</strong>&nbsp;Typically, a personal board of directors is formed to help an individual with professional issues. In contrast, a True North Group is a two-way street, in which members help each other and become both givers and receivers of constructive feedback and ideas. There are no limits to the issues raised in a True North Group, as long as they enable the members to discuss more personal issues.</p><strong>BG:</strong><p><strong>PS:</strong>&nbsp;Who is in your True North Group, and what do they add to your life?</p><strong>PS:</strong><p><strong>BG:</strong>&nbsp;I formed my first True North Group with co-author Doug Baker and two other men in 1975. Over the years the group has expanded to eight men, including five businesspeople, two lawyers and an architect. This group has been a godsend in my life. They have helped me become more self-aware and open and enabled me to understand my blind spots. Their support has given me the courage to take risks with significant challenges, and learn how to give and receive feedback in a non-judgmental way.</p><strong>BG:</strong><p>When my wife Penny was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996, they helped me see that I was in denial that her disease could be fatal, which in turn was preventing me from giving her the emotional support she needed to get through this very difficult time in her life. They knew that both my mother and my fiancée died of cancer and that my fears were blocking me from being a good support person to her. Their help enabled me to stop trying to “fix” her disease — which of course I couldn’t — and just be there for her.</p><p><strong>PS:</strong>&nbsp;How and when did you decide to put the group together in the first place? Did you start with a formal structure (<em>e.g.</em>, weekly meeting time and place), or was it more informal at first? That tradeoff between informality and structure seems very important.</p><strong>PS:</strong><em>e.g.</em><p><strong>BG:</strong>&nbsp;The original four members of the group attended a three-day retreat that built some strong bonds that we wanted to continue. So we decided to get together each week to carry on our discussions. Believe it or not, we have met every Wednesday morning from 7:15 to 8:30 a.m. for the past 36 years.</p><strong>BG:</strong><p>Fearing that we could drift off into social or political discussions, we agreed upon a format of substantive programs that one of us would bring the group for two consecutive sessions on a rotating basis. We began by discussing our life stories — the early events in our lives that helped shape and influence us. We learned that often these earlier events, especially in relationship to our parents, were getting in our way of being fully present and comfortable with ourselves. These discussions were unique in our lives, so we wanted to continue them regularly.</p><p><strong>PS:&nbsp;</strong>How did your group help you think through that arduous decision of leaving Honeywell before you felt permission to go to Medtronic?</p><strong>PS:&nbsp;</strong><p><strong>BG:</strong>&nbsp;In 1989 I had a wake-up call driving home one day. After long periods of denial, I finally acknowledged that I wasn’t happy in my work at Honeywell, although I was one of two candidates in line to become CEO. So I took the issue to my True North Group. They were the ones who helped me acknowledge that I was moving away from being a values-centered leader to engaging in a contest to become CEO of Honeywell, while I wasn’t passionate about the business I was responsible for. They gave me the encouragement to go back to Medtronic, which I had turned down three times the opportunity to become president and chief operating officer. I got very excited about the company’s mission of “restoring people to full life and health” and felt that this mission was something that I could align with. My 13 years with Medtronic became the most important of my career — all because my True North Group opened my eyes to what I was experiencing.</p><strong>BG:</strong><p><strong>PS:</strong>&nbsp;During the first few meetings with your group, how should the conversation go, and what should members leave with?</p><strong>PS:</strong><p><strong>BG:</strong>&nbsp;In the book, Doug Baker and I outline a program for the first 12 sessions of your group, as well as over 30 ideas for additional program topics. We recommend starting by sharing your life stories and the people and experiences that have had the greatest impact on your lives, so that people can get to know each other on a personal basis. In the following sessions people should share times they have lost their way or deviated from their values and their True North. In the third session, which may be the most important of all, people share the greatest crucibles in their lives, what they learned from them, and how those earlier life experiences may be impacting their lives today. Members come away from the session with a deep sense of acceptance by others and the realization that they are not alone in facing great challenges.</p><strong>BG:</strong><p><strong>PS:</strong>&nbsp;What happens when a member of the group isn’t getting along with everyone else or isn’t as supportive?</p><strong>PS:</strong><p><strong>BG:</strong>&nbsp;This is what we term in the book as “the storming phase.” We outline nine common problems, such as loss of trust, violation of group norms, lack of openness and sharing, and breach of confidentiality. In each case we cite examples of how groups we interviewed dealt with these problems and provide suggestions about how to avoid them.</p><strong>BG:</strong><p><strong>PS:</strong>&nbsp;What other resources, besides this book, did you find most insightful or useful in refining your group norms, approach, etc.?</p><strong>PS:</strong><p><strong>BG:</strong>&nbsp;My co-author Doug Baker and I spent three years researching small groups, talking to scholars like Harvard University Professor Robert Putnam, author of&nbsp;<em>Bowling Alone</em>&nbsp;(which our group studied and discussed for several weeks) and&nbsp;<em>American Grace</em>; Dr. Daniel Goleman, creator of emotional intelligence (EQ); religious leader Bill Hybels of Willow Creek Church in Chicago; leaders of the Forum of the Young Presidents Organization; 12-step group leaders; and other experts in small groups, like Parker Palmer. With the help of researcher Jane Cavanaugh, we conducted formal interviews with 52 members of True North Groups.</p><strong>BG:</strong><em>Bowling Alone</em><em>American Grace</em><p>The group norms of trust, confidentiality, openness and non-judgmental feedback emanated naturally from our original group. When I was creating my course on “Authentic Leadership Development” at Harvard Business School, which also used peer facilitators rather than faculty to lead the groups, I decided that we needed to codify the important norms of the group and have all participants sign the Members Contract at their first meeting. This contract is included in our new book because we believe it is essential for group members to agree upon the group’s norms at the outset. Over the past seven years more than 1,500 MBAs and executives at Harvard Business School have participated in True North Groups through the 12-week course. For many of them, the experience has been transformative.</p><p><em>For more insight and guidance on creating your own group, you can find the book,&nbsp;<em>True North Groups</em>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/True-North-Groups-Leadership-Development/dp/1609940075/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1315638945&amp;sr=1-1\" target=\"_hplink\">here</a>.</em></p><em>For more insight and guidance on creating your own group, you can find the book,&nbsp;<em>True North Groups</em>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/True-North-Groups-Leadership-Development/dp/1609940075/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1315638945&amp;sr=1-1\" target=\"_hplink\">here</a>.</em><em>True North Groups</em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/True-North-Groups-Leadership-Development/dp/1609940075/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1315638945&amp;sr=1-1\" target=\"_hplink\">here</a><p>&nbsp;</p>"

They can make a meaningful contribution to developing a new generation of values-centered, authentic leaders who are effective in global organizations using collaboration rather than command and control as their basis for interaction.</em><p>The leadership failures of the past decade are triggering a fundamental reassessment of leadership and leadership development. The command-and-control model so prevalent in the twentieth century has ceased to be effective because it fails to motivate people, particularly younger generations that don’t respond well to hierarchical leadership. Command-and-control leaders are finding it difficult to motivate frontline employees and take advantage of their knowledge and wisdom. This is especially true in global organizations that require collaboration between people of many different cultures.</p><h3>Developing leaders for twenty-first-century organizations</h3><p>Today’s most successful leaders are focusing on sustaining superior performance by aligning people around mission and values and empowering leaders at all levels, while&nbsp;<em>serving</em>&nbsp;customers and<em>collaborating</em>&nbsp;throughout the organization. Over the long term, organizations filled with empowered employees who collaborate to serve customers will consistently outperform hierarchical organizations. Top-down leaders may achieve near-term results, but only&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hbr.org/2007/02/discovering-your-authentic-leadership/ar/1\">authentic leaders</a>&nbsp;can galvanize the entire organization to sustain long-term performance.</p><em>serving</em><em>collaborating</em><a href=\"http://hbr.org/2007/02/discovering-your-authentic-leadership/ar/1\">authentic leaders</a><p>IBM’s CEO Sam Palmisano pioneered these approaches in 2003 by transforming the company’s long-standing bureaucracy into an integrated global network, starting with a “values jam” involving 300,000 employees over a 96-hour period. His article in the May/June 2006 edition of&nbsp;<em>Foreign Affairs</em>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/61713/samuel-j-palmisano/the-globally-integrated-enterprise\">The Globally Integrated Enterprise</a>, called for breaking down silos through collaboration.</p><em>Foreign Affairs</em><a href=\"http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/61713/samuel-j-palmisano/the-globally-integrated-enterprise\">The Globally Integrated Enterprise</a><p>At the same time that leadership is being redefined, leadership development is also being reconsidered. In recent decades companies have focused on succession processes that ensure the emergence of a select group of leaders that can assume the organization’s top roles, investing substantial sums on a few, while relegating others to learning traditional management skills.</p><p>With the shift to collaborative organizations with flat structures, companies are recognizing the need to develop a much broader array of leaders. Today’s global organizations need many talented leaders—hundreds, even thousands—operating throughout the organization, rather than just a few stars.</p><h3>The importance of EQ in leadership development</h3><p>Leadership is no longer based primarily on characteristics, styles, knowledge, skills, and competencies—all of which are related to IQ. It must come from a place of authenticity, which is the essential quality of leaders with high levels of emotional intelligence, or EQ. In my experience I have not seen leaders fail for lack of IQ, but I have observed many leaders fail who lacked EQ.</p><p>Daniel Goleman, the psychologist who originated the concept of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://danielgoleman.info/\">emotional intelligence</a>, believes that “EQ competencies are&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;innate talents, but rather learned capabilities that can be developed to achieve outstanding performance.” He continues, “High levels of cognitive ability (i.e., measured IQ of 120 or greater) are a threshold qualification for leadership roles. Once you are at or above that level, IQ loses power as a predictor of success. EQ then plays a larger role.”</p><a href=\"http://danielgoleman.info/\">emotional intelligence</a><em>not</em><p>In interviews with 125 authentic leaders for&nbsp;<em>True North</em>, we learned that EQ starts with self-awareness of your life story and the crucibles you have experienced. Gaining self-awareness is more difficult than it seems, since it requires three things:</p><em>True North</em><ul>\n<li><em>experience</em>&nbsp;in real-world situations, including leadership opportunities;</li>\n<li><em>reflection</em>&nbsp;about your experiences and processing objectively what you need to improve;</li>\n<li><em>group interactions</em>&nbsp;that provide opportunities to share your experiences and get honest feedback.</li>\n</ul><li><em>experience</em>&nbsp;in real-world situations, including leadership opportunities;</li><em>experience</em><li><em>reflection</em>&nbsp;about your experiences and processing objectively what you need to improve;</li><em>reflection</em><li><em>group interactions</em>&nbsp;that provide opportunities to share your experiences and get honest feedback.</li><em>group interactions</em><h3>The emergence of True North Groups</h3><p>The missing link in leadership development is having a safe place where people can share their experiences, challenges, and frustrations, and receive honest feedback. This link can be provided by True North Groups—small, intimate peer groups where people talk openly about their issues in confidential settings.</p><p>True North Groups provide the feedback that enables leaders to understand their blind spots, open up hidden areas, and gain a deeper understanding of who they are. These groups offer a unique environment for people to develop self-awareness, self-compassion, authenticity, and, ultimately, self-actualization.</p><p>How do True North Groups help people develop as leaders? An important part of self-awareness is accepting yourself—your weaknesses as well as your strengths—and having confidence that others will accept you for who you are. The support and confidence the group provides enables you to face difficult situations in your life and work and navigate them successfully.</p><p>In a True North Group where people share their deepest feelings and greatest difficulties, group members feel comfortable in challenging you when they think you are losing your bearings or deviating from your beliefs and values. Because they know your life story, they are able to perceive how prior events in your life or your motivations may be influencing your decisions today.</p><p>In addition, in your group you learn to accept others rather than judge them, and gain the ability to celebrate their differences and learn from people whose life experiences differ from yours. This dynamic gives you the capacity for sharing yourself in intimate ways and for being more open with others. Your True North Group also serves as a support team when you are facing challenging times.</p><h3>How True North Groups work</h3><p>In a True North Group you gain experience in giving and receiving feedback in nonjudgmental ways without taking it personally. This approach is more likely to enable individuals to absorb the feedback and use it for personal development rather than feedback coming from someone who may not have your best interests at heart. Giving and receiving effective feedback is essential to constructive interactions and a necessity for leaders who want to empower other leaders to sustain high levels of performance.</p><p>Often peers who work together in the same organization or on task teams will want to meet on a more personal basis after the task is complete. They may be looking for people with whom they can share their leadership challenges and get confidential advice. In other cases, colleagues in the same organization are looking for a group of people that helps them grow.</p><p>Many people discuss life experiences with their True North Group that they have shared only with a few others. Other group members report seeing their crucibles in entirely new ways. This can lead to a healthy reframing of one’s most difficult experiences. Revisiting painful and difficult times and exploring their dark sides can be a healing experience. In learning about crucibles others have faced, you realize you are not alone in facing great challenges. Intimate sharing builds trust among group members and leads to higher levels of self-awareness and sensitivity to the challenges others face.</p><p>More than 1,500 MBA students at Harvard Business School have experienced these groups since 2005, as well as participants in executive education courses and World Economic Forum’s Young Global Leaders. Evaluations about their True North Groups from participants—MBAs and midcareer executives alike—have been uniformly positive. Many describe their experience as transformative. True North Groups have also been adopted by several other academic institutions.</p><p>One MBA participant describes her True North Group as “one of my best experiences of my education. It provided support, encouraged introspection, and consisted of the best discussions I’ve had. It gave me an opportunity to reflect on my life and share my feelings in an open and supportive environment. As a result, I faced things about myself I always knew were there but had tried to hide.”</p><p>Thanks to the pioneering example of Unilever CEO Paul Polman, we can see the effect these groups have had on more senior executives. Polman has asked his top 500 executives worldwide to experience these groups. He notes, “Forming True North Groups is an integral part of the Unilever Leadership Development Programme to prepare our future leaders for an increasingly volatile and uncertain world where the only true differentiation is the quality of leadership of all.”</p><p>Polman is paving the way for other corporations to use True North Groups to develop leaders throughout their organizations. There is limited cost to these groups, no professional leaders are required (although some organizations use facilitators to get them started), and minimal staff is needed to support them. In this sense they are scalable for organizations that want to use True North Groups to develop large numbers of leaders.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Just as True North Groups are an effective force in changing people’s lives, I believe they can become instrumental in changing the way organizations work. Widespread use of these groups could lead to the development of values-centered, collaborative leaders at all levels for large global organizations and transform leadership in the process.</p><p>Through True North Groups, leadership development can be transformed, enabling companies to develop many inner-directed leaders who will bring authenticity to their leadership and thus help transform their companies into authentic organizations.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Bill George</strong>&nbsp;is a professor of management practice at Harvard Business School and former chairman and CEO of Medtronic.

The hierarchical model so prevalent in the 20th century no longer motivates people, particularly the younger generations. </span><p></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Today’s most successful leaders focus on sustaining superior performance by aligning people around mission and values and empowering leaders at all levels, while serving customers and collaborating throughout the organization. Top-down leaders may achieve near-term results, but only authentic leaders can galvanize the entire organization to sustain long-term performance. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">It’s clear we also need to reassess leadership development. In recent decades companies have focused more on succession processes that ensure the emergence of a select group of leaders who can successfully assume top leadership roles. With the shift to collaborative organizations with flat structures, companies recognize they need to develop a broader array of leaders. In the 21st century, organizations need many talented leaders–hundreds, even thousands–operating throughout the organization, rather than just a few stars. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Leadership is no longer based primarily on characteristics, styles, knowledge, skills, and competencies–all of which are related to IQ. It must come from an authentic place within, which is the essential quality of leaders with high levels of what psychologist Daniel Goleman refers to as emotional intelligence, or EQ. I have never seen leaders fail because of a lack of IQ. However, I have seen them fail for lack of EQ. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In interviews with 125 authentic leaders for my book True North, our research team and I learned that EQ starts with having a deep understanding and acceptance of one’s life story and the crucibles that people have experienced. Gaining self-awareness is more difficult than it seems. Becoming self-aware requires three things: </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">1. Experience in real-world situations. </span><br><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">2. Reflection about your experiences and the ability to process them objectively. </span><br><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">3. Group interactions that can provide a place to share your experiences and get honest feedback. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">The missing link in leadership development is having a safe place where people can share their experiences, their challenges, and their frustrations, and get honest feedback. This link can be provided by a small, intimate group of peers that allows people to talk openly about these issues in a confidential setting—what we call True North Groups. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">How will a True North Group help people develop as leaders? An important part of self-awareness is accepting yourself and having confidence that others will accept you. The support you will gain in a group and the confidence it will give you will enable you to face challenges and navigate them successfully. In your True North Group you learn how to give and receive feedback in non-judgmental ways without taking it personally, a necessity for leaders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">More than 1,500 HBS students have experienced these groups since 2005, as well as students from multiple executive education courses and Young Global Leaders of the World Economic Forum. Evaluations from 2005 to the present from these participants–MBAs and mid-career executives alike–have been uniformly positive. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Thanks to the pioneering example of Unilever CEO Paul Polman, we can see the effect these groups have on more senior executives. Polman is asking his top five hundred executives worldwide to experience these groups. He notes, “Forming True North Groups is an integral part of the Unilever Leadership Development Programme to prepare our future leaders for an increasingly volatile and uncertain world where the only true differentiation is the quality of leadership of all.” </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Polman’s leadership is also paving the way for other corporations to use True North Groups to develop large numbers of leaders throughout their organizations. There is essentially no cost to these groups, no professional leaders are required (although some organizations use facilitators to get them started), and limited staff is needed to support them. They are scalable for organizations that want to use True North Groups to develop large numbers of leaders. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Widespread use of these groups could lead to a “deep bench” of the kinds of leaders needed now and for the future – and transform leadership in the process. These groups are based on commitment to the discovery of and adherence to one’s guiding values, and dedication to the well-being of each individual in the group and the group itself. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Often peers who work together in the same organization or on task teams want to continue to meet after the task is complete. They may be looking for people with whom they can share their leadership challenges in a confidential setting. One model that has worked well is for small groups of executive women in companies to meet to support their accelerated development. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Through True North Groups, my colleagues and I believe leadership development can be transformed to develop large numbers of inner-directed leaders who will bring authenticity to their leadership and in turn transform their companies into authentic organizations.</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-c\nolor: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Editor’s Note: Bill George’s newest book, True North Group: A Powerful Path to Personal and Leadership Development,is worthy of more than a footnote in this issue of Leader’s Edge. It is a continuation of his best-selling True North, and George wrote it with Doug Baker, founder and co-principal of Conversations of Consequence.</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">In this new book, George continues an idea that came out of True North—how people become leaders. George did an interview on Edgewise, AMA’s podcast program, during which he pointed to how the book offers the means to have “in our lives a small, intimate group of people with whom we can have complete trust, total confidentiality, and be very open.”</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">According to George, a True North Group consists of a group of six to eight people who agree to share the greatest challenges in their lives—both in their work and in their personal lives. George considers it a “very big idea” and so do those who have read the book. Executives see it as a key to leadership development, helping to develop the emotional intelligence and self-awareness that are the essence of leadership. “With such a group,” he told his audience, “you can see yourself as others see you and, most important, have help in working through a difficult situation, either one from your past or one in your present, or, maybe, give you the insight you need to determine where you want to go in the future.”</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">True North Group doesn’t just offer this idea for consideration. It gives readers the practical help they need to choose members of their group and commit trust and confidentiality with one another. As George said, “In our society today, groups have fallen apart. Just having 2,000 people on your Facebook page does not ensure the level of intimacy or support when you really most need it.”</span><br><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\"> </span><br><a href=\"http://www.amanet.org/training/podcasts/3649.aspx\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Listen to Bill George’s Edgewise podcast.</span></a></p></div><span><span style=\"font-size: 15px; white-space: pre-wrap;\"><br></span></span><span><br></span><br><span>The leadership failures of the past decade have triggered a fundamental rethinking of both leadership and leadership development.

Executives see it as a key to leadership development, helping to develop the emotional intelligence and self-awareness that are the essence of leadership. “With such a group,” he told his audience, “you can see yourself as others see you and, most important, have help in working through a difficult situation, either one from your past or one in your present, or, maybe, give you the insight you need to determine where you want to go in the future.”</span><br><span> </span><br><span>True North Group doesn’t just offer this idea for consideration. It gives readers the practical help they need to choose members of their group and commit trust and confidentiality with one another. As George said, “In our society today, groups have fallen apart. Just having 2,000 people on your Facebook page does not ensure the level of intimacy or support when you really most need it.”</span><br><span> </span><br><a href=\"http://www.amanet.org/training/podcasts/3649.aspx\"><span style=\"font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: #000099; background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Listen to Bill George’s Edgewise podcast.</span></a><span>Listen to Bill George’s Edgewise podcast.</span>"

      "<p>FORTUNE — In the Sept. 5 issue of Fortune, we imagined a new kind of fantasy league: one focused on business leaders, where the stats are ruled more by market cap and earnings per share than on-base percentage and earned run averages.</p><p>We want to know whom you would pick. But to give you some help, we’ve asked for the picks of three guest team managers: a guru each in management, investing and business news on television. Today, we give you our management wizard, Bill George.</p><p>Harvard Business School’s Bill George is a best-selling author and the former CEO of Medtronic. His management strategies have made him both a popular professor and an anchor of many notable boards, including ExxonMobil, Goldman Sachs, Novartis&nbsp;and Target. George says his list’s strategy is simple: focus on gathering the “best of the best,” seasoned CEOs who would be playing out of position to get the most out of each skill set. George is confident that, perhaps unlike the Miami Heat, these corporate stars don’t need to go it alone — they can succeed as a stacked team.</p><p>C<strong>EO — Sam Palmisano, IBM</strong></p><strong>EO — Sam Palmisano, IBM</strong><p>George: His track record since becoming CEO in 2002 proves my case; in 2003 he was a pioneer in introducing the first “integrated global network,” buttressed by values-centered leadership and collaboration.</p><p><strong>COO — Alan Mulally, Ford</strong></p><strong>COO — Alan Mulally, Ford</strong><p>George: A great operator and superb team player who gets peak performance with — like Palmisano — values-centered and collaborative leadership.</p><p><strong>CFO — David Viniar, Goldman Sachs</strong></p><strong>CFO — David Viniar, Goldman Sachs</strong><p>George: The only non-CEO on the team, he stands head and shoulders above any other CFO and could be CEO of any other Wall Street bank. He helped Goldman identify the sub-prime mortgage problem in late-2006 and guided Goldman through the 2008 meltdown and its subsequent recovery.</p><p><strong>CMO — Howard Schultz, Starbucks&nbsp;</strong></p><strong>CMO — Howard Schultz, Starbucks&nbsp;</strong><p>George: Who else could sell coffee for $5? He created the customer-friendly Starbucks culture, then stepped back into leadership in 2008 and led the company to much higher levels of global success.</p><p><strong>Chief Designer — Steve Jobs, Apple</strong></p><strong>Chief Designer — Steve Jobs, Apple</strong><p>George: His breakthrough designs have taken Apple to the top of four fields — user-friendly computers (iMac), recording devices (iPod), online music (iTunes singlehandedly wiped out the CD industry) and mobile telephone/information devices (iPhone). Then he created a new field for online information (iPads). No one in history has done this.</p><p><strong>CIO — Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com</strong></p><strong>CIO — Jeff Bezos, Amazon.com</strong><p>George: He created the greatest customer database that is user-friendly and has propelled the company to its leadership position in online merchandising.</p><p><strong>Non-exec chair — Marilyn Carlson Nelson, Carlson Companies</strong></p><strong>Non-exec chair — Marilyn Carlson Nelson, Carlson Companies</strong><p>George: Marilyn Carlson Nelson is the ideal non-executive chair. As chair of Mayo Clinic and Carlson Companies boards [Fortune note: Nelson is the former CEO of Carlson] and chair of governance of ExxonMobil’s board, she appreciates the importance of good governance and its relationship to management.</p><p><strong>General counsel — Ken Frazier, Merck&nbsp;</strong></p><strong>General counsel — Ken Frazier, Merck&nbsp;</strong><p>George: As general counsel, he saved Merck from financial disaster by successfully litigating individual cases in the Vioxx recall.</p><p><strong>Chief People Officer — Anne Mulcahy, Xerox&nbsp;</strong></p><strong>Chief People Officer — Anne Mulcahy, Xerox&nbsp;</strong><p>George: She saved Xerox from pending bankruptcy by rebuilding employee trust and passion for restoring the company well beyond its former greatness.</p><p><strong>Chief Research — Daniel Vasella, MD, Novartis</strong></p><strong>Chief Research — Daniel Vasella, MD, Novartis</strong><p>George: A medical doctor, he guided Novartis to the top of the health care industry by inventing more new drugs than any pharma or biotech company in the past decade.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Origininally Posted on<a href=\"http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/24/bill-george%E2%80%99s-corporate-%E2%80%9Cdream-team%E2%80%9D/\"> Fortune.com</a><br>August 23, 2011&nbsp;</p><a href=\"http://management.fortune.cnn.com/2011/08/24/bill-george%E2%80%99s-corporate-%E2%80%9Cdream-team%E2%80%9D/\"> Fortune.com</a><br>"

      "<p>Thirty months after taking office, President Obama says he has turned his focus to America’s unemployed and job creation. Again.</p><p>As Standard &amp; Poor’s lowered the U.S. credit rating from AAA to AA+ in an historic move last Friday, the president called jobs his “singular focus.” In December 2010, he announced a “pivot and focus” on jobs. The previous year he called it “a sustained and relentless focus.” Financial markets have voted with their feet, as investors have reduced equity values by more than 11 percent in the past week.</p><p>And yet every time there’s talk about rebuilding the nation’s jobs-machine, elected officials get pulled off course by distractions like partisan showdowns over the budget and debt ceiling; overhauling the health-insurance system; wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and Libya; the Gulf oil spill; and the Japanese earthquake and nuclear disaster. Given the country’s deep fiscal troubles, our government leaders’ inability to maintain focus on such a fundamentally important issue as job creation is particularly worrying. If concerted actions aren’t taken immediately, America may lapse into Japanese-style malaise.</p><p>Right now, the United States has its lowest percentage of citizens in modern times – less than 55 percent – working in full-time jobs. The 25 million workers (16.2 percent) unable to find full-time work and the hundreds of thousands dropping out of the workforce every month must wonder if the president and congressional leaders are serious about the real issues the country faces: no growth and no jobs.</p><p>Want to know how to rebuild the U.S. economy and generate jobs? Ask the CEOs who create them. In recent weeks I have had conversations about this subject with dozens of business leaders. They believe the debates in Washington that virtually shut down the government in April and again this summer are largely irrelevant to what’s required for America to regain its economic might. As politicians debate how to divvy up a shrinking pie (Democrats want the wealthy to support the economically less fortunate, and Republicans want people to keep the money they have earned), CEOs want to focus on how to&nbsp;<em>expand&nbsp;</em>the pie for all stakeholders: their customers, employees, shareholders and society-at-large.</p><em>expand&nbsp;</em><p>If growth opportunities and the U.S. business climate are attractive, they prefer to invest here, but today that’s hardly the case. With domestic growth approaching zero and the regulatory, tax and political climate getting worse, CEOs are investing in rapidly growing emerging markets in Asia, Latin America and Middle East – and jobs follow markets. That’s not a philosophical view. It’s purely pragmatic.</p><hr><p><em>Posting on the <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-leadership/enough-talk-about-jobs-wheres-the-action/2011/08/09/gIQA1Z1e4I_story.html\">Washington Post on August 9, 2011</a> – This piece is part of a&nbsp;<a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/leadership\">leadership roundtable</a>&nbsp;on unemployment and restarting America’s jobs engine — with opinion pieces by former Treasury Secretary&nbsp;<a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-leadership/only-presidential-leadership-can-fix-the-us-economys-structural-impediments-to-growth/2011/08/09/gIQAdGNa4I_story.html\">Paul H.

      "<p>In&nbsp;recent months several high-level leaders have mysteriously lost their way. Dominique Strauss-Kahn, former head of the International Monetary Fund and a leading French politician, was arraigned on charges of sexual assault. Before that David Sokol, rumored to be Warren Buffett’s successor, was forced to resign for trading in Lubrizol stock prior to recommending that Berkshire Hathaway purchase the company. Examples abound of other recent failures:</p><ul>\n<li>Hewlett-Packard CEO Mark Hurd resigned for submitting false expense reports concerning his relationship with a contractor.</li>\n<li>US Senator John Ensign (R-NV) resigned after covering up an extramarital affair with monetary payoffs.</li>\n<li>Lee B. Farkas, former chairman of giant mortgage lender Taylor, Bean &amp; Whitaker, in April was found guilty for his role in one of the largest bank fraud schemes in American history.</li>\n</ul><li>Hewlett-Packard CEO Mark Hurd resigned for submitting false expense reports concerning his relationship with a contractor.</li><li>US Senator John Ensign (R-NV) resigned after covering up an extramarital affair with monetary payoffs.</li><li>Lee B. Farkas, former chairman of giant mortgage lender Taylor, Bean &amp; Whitaker, in April was found guilty for his role in one of the largest bank fraud schemes in American history.</li><p>These talented leaders were highly successful in their respective fields and at the peak of their careers. This makes their behavior especially perplexing, raising questions about what caused them to lose their way:</p><ul>\n<li>Why do leaders known for integrity and leadership engage in unethical activities?</li>\n<li>Why do they risk great careers and unblemished reputations for such ephemeral gains?</li>\n<li>Do they think they won’t get caught or believe their elevated status puts them above the law?</li>\n<li>Was this the first time they did something inappropriate, or have they been on the slippery slope for years?</li>\n</ul><li>Why do leaders known for integrity and leadership engage in unethical activities?</li><li>Why do they risk great careers and unblemished reputations for such ephemeral gains?</li><li>Do they think they won’t get caught or believe their elevated status puts them above the law?</li><li>Was this the first time they did something inappropriate, or have they been on the slippery slope for years?</li><p>In these ongoing revelations, the media, politicians, and the general public frequently characterize these leaders as bad people, even calling them evil. Simplistic notions of good and bad only cloud our understanding of why good leaders lose their way, and how this could happen to any of us.</p><p>Leaders who lose their way are not bad people; rather, they lose their moral bearings, often yielding to seductions in their paths. Very few people go into leadership roles to cheat or do evil, yet we all have the capacity for actions we deeply regret unless we stay grounded.</p><h3>Self-reflection: a path to leadership development</h3><p>Before anyone takes on a leadership role, they should ask themselves, “<em>Why</em>&nbsp;do I want to lead?” and “What’s the&nbsp;<em>purpose</em>&nbsp;of my leadership?” These questions are simple to ask, but finding the real answers may take decades. If the honest answers are power, prestige, and money, leaders are at risk of relying on external gratification for fulfillment. There is nothing wrong with desiring these outward symbols as long as they are combined with a deeper desire to serve something greater than oneself.</p><em>Why</em><em>purpose</em><p>Leaders whose goal is the quest for power over others, unlimited wealth, or the fame that comes with success tend to look to others to gain satisfaction, and often appear self-centered and egotistical. They start to believe their own press. As leaders of institutions, they eventually believe the institution cannot succeed without them.</p><h3>The leadership trap</h3><p>While most people value fair compensation for their accomplishments, few leaders start out seeking only money, power, and prestige. Along the way, the rewards—bonus checks, newspaper articles, perks, and stock appreciation—fuel increasing desires for more.</p><p>This creates a deep desire to keep it going, often driven by desires to overcome narcissistic wounds from childhood. Many times, this desire is so strong that leaders breach the ethical standards that previously governed their conduct, which can be bizarre and even illegal.</p><blockquote><p>Very few people go into leadership to cheat or do evil.</p></blockquote><p>Very few people go into leadership to cheat or do evil.</p><p>As Novartis chairman Daniel Vasella (HBS PMD 57)&nbsp;<a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/11/18/332268/index.htm\">told Fortune magazine</a>, “for many of us the idea of being a successful manager—leading the company from peak to peak, delivering the goods quarter by quarter—is an intoxicating one. It is a pattern of celebration leading to belief, leading to distortion. When you achieve good results… you are typically celebrated, and you begin to believe that the figure at the center of all that champagne-toasting is yourself.”</p><a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2002/11/18/332268/index.htm\">told Fortune magazine</a><p>When leaders focus on external gratification instead of inner satisfaction, they lose their grounding. Often they reject the honest critic who speaks truth to power. Instead, they surround themselves with sycophants who tell them what they want to hear. Over time, they are unable to engage in honest dialogue; others learn not to confront them with reality.</p><h3>The dark side of leadership</h3><p>Many leaders get to the top by imposing their will on others, even destroying people standing in their way. When they reach the top, they may be paranoid that others are trying to knock them off their pedestal. Sometimes they develop an impostor complex, caused by deep insecurities that they aren’t good enough and may be unmasked.</p><p>To prove they aren’t impostors, they drive so hard for perfection that they are incapable of acknowledging their failures. When confronted by them, they convince themselves and others that these problems are neither their fault nor their responsibility. Or they look for scapegoats to blame for their problems. Using their power, charisma, and communications skills, they force people to accept these distortions, causing entire organizations to lose touch with reality.</p><p>At this stage leaders are vulnerable to making big mistakes, such as violating the law or putting their organizations’ existence at risk. Their distortions convince them they are doing nothing wrong, or they rationalize that their deviations are acceptable to achieve a greater good.</p><p>During the financial crisis, Lehman CEO Richard Fuld refused to recognize that Lehman was undercapitalized. His denial turned balance sheet misjudgments into catastrophe for the entire financial system. Fuld persistently rejected advice to seek added capital, deluding himself into thinking the federal government would bail him out. When the crisis hit, he had run out of options other than bankruptcy.</p><p>It’s lonely at the top, because leaders know they are ultimately responsible for the lives and fortunes of people. If they fail, many get deeply hurt. They often deny the burdens and loneliness, becoming incapable of facing reality. They shut down their inner voice, because it is too painful to confront or even acknowledge; it may, however, appear in their dreams as they try to resolve conflicts rustling around inside their heads.</p><p>Meanwhile, their work lives and personal lives get out of balance. They lose touch with those closest to them̬their spouses, children, and best friends—or co-opt them with their points of view. Eventually, they lose their capacity to think logically about important issues.</p><h3>Values-centered leadership</h3><p>Leading is high stress work. There is no way to avoid the constant challenges of being responsible for people, organizations, outcomes, and uncertainties in the environment. Leaders who move up have greater freedom to control their destinies, but also experience increased pressure and seduction.</p><p>Leaders can avoid these pitfalls by devoting themselves to personal development that cultivates their inner compass, or True North. This requires reframing their leadership from being&nbsp;<em>heroes</em>&nbsp;to being<em>servants of the people they lead</em>. This process requires thought and introspection because many people get into leadership roles in response to their ego needs. It enables them to transition from seeking external gratification to finding internal satisfaction by making meaningful contributions through their leadership.</p><em>heroes</em><em>servants of the people they lead</em><p>Maintaining their equilibrium amid this stress requires discipline. Some people practice meditation or yoga to relieve stress, while others find solace in prayer or taking long runs or walks. Still others find relief through laughter, music, television, sporting events, and reading. Their choices don’t matter, as long as they relieve stress and enable them to think clearly about work and personal issues.</p><h3>A system to support values-centered leadership</h3><p>The reality is that people cannot stay grounded by themselves. Leaders depend on people closest to them to stay centered. They should seek out people who influence them in profound ways and stay connected to them. Often their spouse or partner knows them best. They aren’t impressed by titles, prestige, or wealth accumulation; instead, they worry that these outward symbols may be causing the loss of authenticity.</p><p>Spouses and partners can’t carry this entire burden though. We need mentors to advise us when facing difficult decisions. Reliable mentors are entirely honest and straight with us, defining reality and developing action plans.</p><p>In addition, intimate support groups like the True North Groups, with whom people can share their life experiences, hopes, fears, and challenges, are invaluable. Members of our True North Group aren’t impressed by external success, but care enough about us as human beings and as leaders to confront us when we aren’t being honest with ourselves.</p><p>As Senator Ensign told his fellow senators in a farewell speech in May, “When one takes a position of leadership, there is a very real danger of getting caught up in the hype surrounding that status … Surround yourselves with people who will be honest with you about how you really are and what you are becoming, and then make them promise to not hold back… from telling you the truth.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Originally Posted: <a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6741.html\">Harvard Working Knowldge&nbsp;</a><br>June 6, 2011</p><a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6741.html\">Harvard Working Knowldge&nbsp;</a><br><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

My defining moment came in the fall of 1988, driving home around Lake of Isles when I looked in the mirror and saw a very unhappy person. Outwardly, I was doing well: Penny and I had been married for nearly twenty years, our sons Jeff and Jon were thriving in school, and we had been part of the Twin Cities community since 1970. I was one of the leading candidates to become Honeywell’s next CEO. But in that “flash in the mirror,” I recognized I was striving so hard to become CEO by trying to impress others that I was losing sight of my True North – my inner moral compass – and failing to be that values-centered leader. I wasn’t passionate about my work, and I was even less happy with myself. I drove home and told Penny, who concurred with my critical self-assessment. She recommended I reconsider the offer to join Medtronic as president I had recently turned down. Months later, when I walked through Medtronic’s door for the first time, I felt like I was coming home – home to a place where I could be that values-centered leader, working with the remarkable people of Medtronic to make significant contributions by restoring millions of people to fuller life and health.</p><p>My thirteen years at Medtronic were the capstone of my 33 years in business. When I retired, I felt I had been relatively successful in attaining my first goal, but acknowledged I had no influence on leaders outside my immediate sphere. So I decided to shift my focus to helping develop the next generation of leaders – from MBA students to newly appointed CEOs. Focusing on teaching, writing, and mentoring the last nine years, I have become confident that the new leaders are far better, more values-centered, and authentic than my generation was.</p><p>Tonight I ask you to think about your leadership and consider three important questions that will impact your leadership and your career:</p><p><em>#1: As graduates, what can you anticipate lies ahead in the business world and where should you devote your leadership gifts?<br></em><em>#2: What will be required to fulfill your dreams as leaders in the world of business?<br></em><em>#3: How can you sustain your leadership?</em></p><em>#1: As graduates, what can you anticipate lies ahead in the business world and where should you devote your leadership gifts?<br></em><br><em>#2: What will be required to fulfill your dreams as leaders in the world of business?<br></em><br><em>#3: How can you sustain your leadership?</em><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">What Lies Ahead for You</span></p><span>What Lies Ahead for You</span><p>In business the era in which you live shapes the leadership and values of the new generation. In your case we have just come out of “Leadership’s Lost Decade.” It started with the dot.com crash and the fall of Enron and dozens of other companies and ended with the economic meltdown of 2008 followed by the Great Recession. While many attribute these problems to faulty accounting, too much leverage, and failure to enforce regulations, in my opinion the root cause is a series of leadership failures – not all leaders, of course, but enough leadership failures that the general public has lost a great deal of trust in business leaders. That’s the bad news.</p><p>The good news is from these failures we have collectively learned our lessons as leaders. We learned that maximizing shareholder value ultimately destroys the short-term value created. The short-term pressure on corporate leaders is relentless, still but the new leaders have learned from their predecessors that playing the short-term game will never lead to sustainable long-term value.</p><p>We have also learned that “rock star” CEOs selected for their&nbsp;<em>charisma, style and image</em>, especially those from outside the organization, result in choosing the wrong leaders. Today’s leaders are being selected for their&nbsp;<em>character, substance and integrity</em>, over 80 percent from inside the company. These new leaders are focusing on achieving high performance by being values-centered and customer-centric, rather than catering to short-term shareholders. They do so by recognizing that their job, as Unilever CEO Paul Polman has said, is to serve their customers, not their shareholders, by empowering their employees to step up and lead rather than attempting to exert power over them.</p><em>charisma, style and image</em><em>character, substance and integrity</em><p>The leaders of your era will not be U.S.-centric as my generation has been, but global in their orientation. With developing markets growing at 8-10 percent per year and developed markets at only 2-3 percent, business leaders must have a keen understanding of global markets and the ability to align people from diverse cultures around the organization’s mission and its values.</p><p>We live in an era of rapidly changing technology that connects us with people around the world, anywhere, anytime, and lead fuller, more active, and healthier lives. The rate of technological change is inexorable – often imperfect, but always unstoppable. The same is true for the globalization of labor markets. In the future jobs will follow markets, and organizations will go around the world looking for the highest quality, most skilled workers, not the cheapest. In the U.S. our competitive advantages are innovation, entrepreneurship, and adaptability. No nation in the world can match us in this regard. As you think about your career and your leadership, I urge you to develop not only the skills to succeed in this global era, but the “can do” attitude that goes beyond embracing change, to seek it out as opportunity for success.</p><p>In the future organizations will need far fewer traditional managers who serve as budget controllers, planners, and information conduits, and vastly more working leaders – people at all levels who lead teams of people creating things, making things, and selling things. Organizational spans of control will go from 4-8 direct reports to 15-20 or more, as successful leaders engage directly in the business itself, rather than presiding over it, controlling numbers, and reporting on outcomes. The latter will be done by computers in real time, but computers and processes can never replace the vitality of dynamic human interactions to accomplish mutual goals.</p><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Fulfilling Your Dreams as a Leader</span></p><span>Fulfilling Your Dreams as a Leader</span><p>The second question is more personal: how fulfill your dreams as a business leader? To answer this question, you have to know yourself and be genuinely honest&nbsp; with yourself. What’s is really important in your life? Where are your passions? What motivates you at a deeper level? What’s your purpose as a human being and leader?</p><p>Steve Jobs has a habit he uses every day. He looks in the mirror and asks, “If today is my last day on earth, am I doing what I really love?” Of course, at times the answer will be “no,” and some days are naturally better than others, as we all have to do things we don’t especially like. As Jobs says, “If there are too many days where the answer is “no,” then it’s time to take a deeper look at yourself and rethink what you are doing with your life.</p><p>Poet Mary Oliver puts it this way, “Tell me, what is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?”<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Caroline/Downloads/bill's%20blog%20-%205.22.11.docx#_ftn1\">[1]</a>&nbsp;Life is indeed precious, and if you let yourself go free and explore what excites you, it can be a wild ride.</p><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Caroline/Downloads/bill's%20blog%20-%205.22.11.docx#_ftn1\">[1]</a><p>I tell my students, “Never sell your soul to the Man.” By that I mean, be your own person and never, ever let someone else own you, or control your life. The danger, of course, is that you get on a slippery slope where you enjoy the money, power, and recognition for what you’re doing, but it doesn’t stir your passions. If you follow that course, you may wake up some day and find yourself so far away from the real you – and what you really want to do with your life – that you feel trapped, in a box, and don’t have the courage to give it all up and do what you want to do. Ten years later, you ask whatever happened to the person who dreamed the impossible dream? I’ve dreamed that impossible dream many times in completely different situations. At first, I feel like I am climbing through solid rock; but if I stay the course, the dream not only comes true but goes far beyond anything I ever imagined. . . like being on this stage tonight with this robe on.</p><p>As Jesus asks, “For what will it profit (people) if they gain the whole world, yet forfeit their life?”<a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Caroline/Downloads/bill's%20blog%20-%205.22.11.docx#_ftn2\">[2]</a>&nbsp;It may take years of soul-searching and introspection to discern the purpose of your leadership, but that’s no reason not to keep searching. Without doubt, you&nbsp;<em>will</em>&nbsp;become a leader as we are all called to lead and use our gifts to serve others. If you know where you’re going – and it isn’t just about you, but for a greater purpose – then people are naturally going to follow your lead.</p><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Caroline/Downloads/bill's%20blog%20-%205.22.11.docx#_ftn2\">[2]</a><em>will</em><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Sustaining Your Leadership</span></p><span>Sustaining Your Leadership</span><p>My final question is, “How can you sustain your leadership throughout your lifetime in spite of all the barriers, pressures, and seductions without getting off course of your True North?” This certainly isn’t easy.</p><p>Sustaining your leadership over a long period of time takes genuine hard work in developing yourself as a leader – the same level of discipline that it takes to become a great athlete or superior musician. This requires developing your emotional intelligence, or EQ. Much of your formal education is based on building your knowledge and IQ. In my experience, I have not witnessed leaders fail for lack of IQ, but have seen many, many leaders fail for lack of EQ. The recent cases of Berkshire Hathaway’s David Sokol and the IMF’s Dominic Strauss-Kahn remind us how easily outstanding leaders at the peak of their careers can destroy thirty years of good work in thirty minutes by losing their way.</p><p>The core of EQ lies in self-awareness, an essential quality for all authentic leaders. This week I heard Ford CEO Alan Mulally talk about how he had turned Ford from billions of losses into rapid growth, escalating market share, and billions in profits. In the past four years Mulally engineered one of the greatest corporate turnarounds, yet here is a man who is highly authentic and extremely humble, constantly demonstrating high levels of self-awareness.</p><p>Being self-aware is easier said than done. Four thousand years ago the Oracle of Delphi told us, “Know thyself.” All too often we see ourselves through our own rose-colored glasses. Becoming a self-aware leader requires three things: 1) having real-world leadership experiences, 2) reflecting on those experiences through habits like meditation, prayer, yoga, long walks, and 3) having a support group to give you that honest feedback.</p><p>The latter could take the form of a loved one, close friend, mentor, or small group of peers. In my leadership journey I have done all of these things. Penny is always there to give me that support and candid feedback, as are my mentors and close friends. For more than 25 years I have had the privilege of being part of a men’s group and a couple’s group. These groups have been there to guide me when I faced difficult decisions like joining Medtronic or when Penny was diagnosed with breast cancer. I can’t encourage you enough to build your support team now. When you find yourself in a crisis – something that can happen when you least expect it – it’s too late to build your team. Plus it will enrich you greatly as a person and help you develop as a self-aware, authentic leader.</p><p>Finally, sustaining your leadership means leading an integrated life. In this era there is no such thing as perfect balance between work and home life. There are always sacrifices to be made, like coming to St. Thomas to earn your MBA. But you can be the same person in all aspects of your life – your family, work, community, and personal lives – thereby maintaining your integrity as a whole person by being&nbsp;<em>fully present</em>&nbsp;in all these situations.</p><em>fully present</em><p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Closing</span></p><span>Closing</span><p>Let me close by asking you to think about the end of your life: you’re in your nineties and have only a few hours to live. Your adult children and grandchildren are gathered around you. Your favorite granddaughter – I’m thinking of our granddaughter Dylan who turned four this week – asks you, “Grandpa or Grandma, what did you do to make a difference in the world?” I hope you won’t tell that you made so much money she never has to work a day in her life, like you did. I hope you will tell her what’s important in your life. The time to think about that is now, because you’re building your legacy every day.</p><p>As Robert F. Kennedy once said, “Few will have the greatness to bend history itself, but each of us can commit to a series of actions to make the world better, and the sum total of all those actions will write the history of your generation.” Maybe there is one of you who will bend history, but all the rest of us we have the opportunity to make a difference – right here, right now.</p><p>My hope for each of you as you receive your diploma is that you will make a vow to use your leadership gifts to make this world a better place. I feel confident tonight not only that your future is bright indeed, but that the history of your generation will be written to say that this was a generation of leaders who led with their values and made the world a better place.</p><p><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Caroline/Downloads/bill's%20blog%20-%205.22.11.docx#_ftnref1\"></a></p><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Caroline/Downloads/bill's%20blog%20-%205.22.11.docx#_ftnref1\"></a><hr><p><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Caroline/Downloads/bill's%20blog%20-%205.22.11.docx#_ftnref1\">[1]</a>&nbsp;Oliver, M. “A Summer Day”</p><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Caroline/Downloads/bill's%20blog%20-%205.22.11.docx#_ftnref1\">[1]</a><p>&nbsp;</p><p align=\"left\"><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Caroline/Downloads/bill's%20blog%20-%205.22.11.docx#_ftnref2\">[2]</a>&nbsp;Mathew 16:26 (The New Oxford Annotated Bible, 1991)</p><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/Caroline/Downloads/bill's%20blog%20-%205.22.11.docx#_ftnref2\">[2]</a>"

      "<p>Since the fall of Enron nearly a decade ago, I have been critical of many corporate leaders.</p><p>It wasn’t just convicted criminals like Jeff Skilling of Enron, WorldCom’s Bernie Ebbers, Tyco’s Dennis Kozlowski, or Qwest’s Joe Nacchio. I was more distressed over the 100-plus CEOs whose companies had accounting “adjustments” that ranged into the billions of dollars, including formerly great companies like Bristol Myers and Xerox.</p><p>This was my generation of CEOs, most of whom grew up in the era of John F. Kennedy idealism. We vowed we would do better when we were in charge. Much as I hate to admit it, as a group we did worse than our predecessors. We were CEOs in the 1990s when we had the wind at our backs, with escalating stock prices and the media treating CEOs like rock stars. Then it all blew up with Enron.</p><p>There were lots of exceptions, of course: IBM’s Lou Gerstner, GE’s Jack Welch, Intel’s Andy Grove, Microsoft’s Bill Gates, and Berkshire’s Warren Buffett deserved their rock-star status. But far too many placed their stock prices and self-interest ahead of their companies’ long-term health, while taking excessive bonuses for laying off thousands of employees.</p><p>Many sold their souls to Wall Street to hype their stock options and ended up destroying the shareholder value they created. Along the way they breached the trust of customers, employees and society, not to mention shareholders left holding the bag.</p><p>Just as trust in corporate leaders was recovering, Wall Street’s game boomeranged to destroy icons like Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, AIG and Lehman. That launched a frantic hunt for the culprits. This time, fewer actual criminals were found. But we passed legislation to constrain all corporations, as the economy struggled to recover from the Great Recession. Sadly, trust in corporate leaders sank to an all-time low and still hasn’t recovered.</p><p>Overlooked in the search for scapegoats is a new reality: The CEOs appointed since the fall of Enron are an extraordinary group of leaders. They are diligently restoring their companies to greatness through values-centered leadership that is producing sustainable performance. They learned not to kowtow to Wall Street as their predecessors did. Rather, they are providing 21st-century leadership to make their companies highly competitive on a global basis by investing in people and capital.</p><p>There are some striking things about these new leaders: They were mostly chosen from within their organizations, not by headhunters seeking rock stars. In contrast to many of their predecessors, they were not selected for their charisma, style and image, but for their character, substance and integrity. Their compensation is based on their companies’ long-term performance, not on their short-term stock prices. More importantly, they are focused on creating long-term value for their customers that will ultimately benefit their employees, long-term shareholders, and society at large.</p><p>Who are these leaders? Nationally, take a close look at IBM’s Sam Palmisano, PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi, Ford’s Alan Mulally, Avon’s Andrea Jung, ExxonMobil’s Rex Tillerson, Facebook’s Sheryl Sandberg, Merck’s Ken Frazier, Wal-Mart’s Mike Duke, and McDonald’s Jim Skinner. With exceptions of Mulally, who spent more than 30 years at Boeing before joining Ford in 2006, and Sandberg, who worked at Google before joining Facebook three years ago, these leaders grew up within their organizations and learned what is required to create sustainable value for all stakeholders.</p><p>Here in Minnesota we are blessed with the finest group of leaders we have had in the past 40 years. The leadership, character and performance of CEOs like Cargill’s Greg Page, Ken Powell of General Mills, UnitedHealth’s Steve Hemsley, Ecolab’s Doug Baker Jr., U.S.Bancorp’s Richard Davis and Target’s Gregg Steinhafel is extraordinary. All of them were promoted from within and are investing in the long-term health of their companies, building strong competitive positions globally, and providing values-centered leadership to their organizations, while achieving outstanding near-term results.</p><p>Former Vice President Walter Mondale once told me he consulted Goldman Sachs’ renowned CEO John Whitehead to find who the values-centered corporate leaders were. Whitehead’s response: “You should start in Minnesota. They’re all there.”</p><p>Not quite all of them. But one of Minnesota’s great strengths is the leadership of our corporations. It has kept our economy healthy for four decades as other states have declined. The salient characteristics of Minnesota’s corporate leaders include their commitment to corporate and community values, their willingness to invest for the long term and the ability to build sustainable organizations that prosper by being competitive in the global world.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Originally Posted in the <a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/business/121393624.html\">Star-Tribune</a> May 7, 2011</p><a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/business/121393624.html\">Star-Tribune</a><p>&nbsp;</p>"

      "<p>On April 4, alumnae and leadership luminaries joined St. Kate’s to celebrate the 25th anniversary of its Master of Arts in Organizational Leadership (MAOL) program.&nbsp;</p><p>Headliner Bill George flew in from Boston — the former Medtronic CEO and chairman and author is now a professor at Harvard Business School — while retired MAOL Founding Director Julie Bell White Newman came from Naples, FL, for the festivities.</p><p>University President Andrea J. Lee, IHM — who had just stepped off the plane from Italy — welcomed the 250 guests at Rauenhorst Hall in Coeur de Catherine.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The art of leadership</strong><br>Bill George discussed “The Art of Leadership” with Emmy Award-winning journalist and author Cathy Wurzer, host of MPR’s “Morning Edition” and co-host of Twin Cities Public Television’s “Almanac.”&nbsp;</p><strong>The art of leadership</strong><br><p>They spoke about how leadership and perceptions of it have changed since 1986 — the year St. Kate’s MAOL program was founded, in response to the need for graduate business education focused on leadership and ethics.</p><p><strong>The leadership core</strong><br>During the hourlong conversation with Wurzer, George, co-author of several books on ethics and leadership, returned to the attributes of the successful leader — values-based, emotional intelligence and well-grounded — to illustrate many of his points.</p><strong>The leadership core</strong><br><p>“Each one of us is a leader, and a successful organization needs leaders across the company,” said George. He added that aligning employees around a mission and values, even as they are asked to adapt to changes in the marketplace, was fundamental to Medtronic averaging 35 percent annual growth during his tenure as CEO and chairman.</p><p>George attributed his success as a leader to emotional intelligence and self-awareness, but added that introspection and reflection — two key practices vital to developing emotional intelligence — are easily lost in the current business environment that puts a premium on speed and values short-term profits over long-term gains.</p><p>“The hardest thing to do is to lead yourself,” he said. The ability to “look yourself in the mirror“ is not easy and that everyone needs honest feedback from peers who “see you as you really are.”</p><p>At Harvard Business School’s Advanced Leadership Institute, George is currently involved in setting up peer groups of business professionals to provide each other honest feedback and support.</p><p>“The key thing is resilience — to be able to pick yourself up, adapt and still hold onto your values,” he said.</p><p><strong>Advancing leadership&nbsp;</strong><br>George said the old corporate model, of rigid hierarchy, needs to change because it creates a culture that doesn’t support women or dual-career couples.&nbsp;</p><strong>Advancing leadership&nbsp;</strong><br><p>“We’ve allowed it to become a gender issue,” said George, stating that men equally want more work-life balance and flexible options for career advancement.</p><p>“The typical career path is flawed,” he added. “You have to create an environment that people want to work in.”&nbsp;</p><p>He also cautioned baby-boomers that it may be time to step aside and give younger workers the opportunity to gain valuable experience and develop as leaders.&nbsp;</p><p>“They’re not going to wait around 15 or 15 years,” he said. “Adapt yourself to new roles and new positions. Managing people and controlling budgets are not the way of the future.”</p><p><strong>Acknowledgements, and cake!</strong><br>In closing the evening, Paula King, Ph.D., dean of the School of Business and Leadership (SBL), announced that 44 donors had contributed more than $21,000 towards a special SBL campaign goal of $25,000 to support graduate student financial aid and study abroad grants.&nbsp;</p><strong>Acknowledgements, and cake!</strong><br><p>Corporate matching sponsors for the evening were 3M, Cargill, Ecolab, St. Jude Medical and Thomson Reuters.</p><p>Guests also received a “swag bag” of MAOL materials, including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://minerva.stkate.edu/news_events.nsf/stories/minn_census_corp_leadership?OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The 2010 Minnesota Census of Women in Corporate Leadership</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>that was co-authored by Rebecca Hawthorne, MAOL program director, and Joann Bangs, economics professor in the program.</p><a href=\"http://minerva.stkate.edu/news_events.nsf/stories/minn_census_corp_leadership?OpenDocument\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The 2010 Minnesota Census of Women in Corporate Leadership</em></a><em>The 2010 Minnesota Census of Women in Corporate Leadership</em><em>&nbsp;</em><p><strong>More about MAOL</strong><br>The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.stkate.edu/academic/maol/\" target=\"_blank\">Master of Arts in Organizational Leadership program</a>&nbsp;at St. Catherine University offers an alternative to the traditional MBA, developing students’ professional and personal abilities to be effective, ethical and enduring leaders.</p><strong>More about MAOL</strong><br><a href=\"http://www.stkate.edu/academic/maol/\" target=\"_blank\">Master of Arts in Organizational Leadership program</a><p>Since its creation in 1986, the program has added an array of concentrations, including partnerships with Hamline’s Law School and Health Law Institute, as well as custom organizational leadership certificates offered on-site at leading corporations such as Fairview and Wells Fargo.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, the MAOL program became a<a href=\"http://www.stkate.edu/academic/maol/peacecorps.php\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;Peace Corps Fellows—USA program partner</a>, adding another feather to its globally focused cap.

      "<p>Two and a half years after the 2008 financial meltdown, business types are adapting to more regulation.</p><p>For Bill George, the former biz whiz turned scholar of leadership, the crisis brought a new audience for what he’s been saying all along: Obsessing over short-term shareholder value leads only to disaster.</p><p>“I think more than ever, we need to have leaders who are willing to take a long-term approach to meeting customer needs and creating long-term shareholder value,” he told IBD. “We’re seeing among corporate leaders a fundamental reassessment of how they approach their business.”</p><p>George, 68, draws from his experience as head of medical device giant&nbsp;Medtronic&nbsp;(<a rel=\"StockSymbol.axd?symbol=MDT\" href=\"http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/ArticlePrint.aspx?sec=Management&amp;col=LeadersInSuccess\">MDT</a>), where for 13 years he held executive positions, including CEO from 1991 to 2001.</p><a rel=\"StockSymbol.axd?symbol=MDT\" href=\"http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/ArticlePrint.aspx?sec=Management&amp;col=LeadersInSuccess\">MDT</a><p>During his time there, the company’s market cap went from $1 billion to $60 billion.</p><p>Meanwhile, the share price rocketed 1,800% from 1993 to 2000 .</p><p>Since then, he’s joined the faculty of Harvard Business School and has written several books on leadership based on his achievements and his study of successful CEOs of many other companies.</p><p>His most recent, “Seven Lessons for Leading in Crisis,” came out in 2009 at the recession’s bottom.</p><h3>George’s Keys</h3><ul>\n<li>Turned Medtronic into a major global company during the 1990s and has written best-selling books on leadership.</li>\n<li>Follows what he calls his True North: “the internal compass of your beliefs, values and principles that guide you through life.”</li>\n</ul><li>Turned Medtronic into a major global company during the 1990s and has written best-selling books on leadership.</li><li>Follows what he calls his True North: “the internal compass of your beliefs, values and principles that guide you through life.”</li><p>As he recounts in the book, he’s had plenty of experience with crisis in his own life. After obtaining his Master of Business Administration from Harvard in 1966, he worked for three years as special assistant to the Navy secretary in the thick of the Vietnam War. George describes seeing colleagues manipulate the numbers of enemies killed to please their boss, Defense Secretary Robert McNamara.</p><p>Many CEOs also lose touch with reality when they are surrounded by sycophants, he says.</p><p>“(It taught me) how hard it is in a large organization to know what’s really going on unless you’re out there on the ground,” George said. “All the good leaders I know are on the ground with their customers, figuring out what’s going on, not sitting in meetings in their office to talk about customers.”</p><p><strong>On The Go</strong></p><strong>On The Go</strong><p>George applied these lessons when he took over Medtronic. During his CEO tenure, he regularly visited the labs and factory floors making the products and the physicians and patients who used them.</p><p>The people he spoke to weren’t always happy; one doctor was so angry about a malfunctioning device that he threw a bloody catheter at George. But that, he wrote, “lit a fire under me to ensure that our company produced only perfect products.”</p><p>Such criticism can be hard to take, especially when it comes from what many businessmen regard as their traditional enemy: government regulators.</p><p>George’s own tangles with the Food and Drug Administration started way back in 1970, when he worked for microwave-oven pioneer Litton Industries. Soon after George’s arrival at the firm, the surgeon general called the ovens hazardous to consumers’ health.</p><p>George writes that his first instinct was defiance, since the company believed the ovens were safe. But he realized that the regulatory issue underscored Litton’s real lack of quality control.</p><p>“I learned firsthand the importance of understanding the mind-set of regulators and government officials and building a cooperative, problem-solving relationship with them instead of being defensive,” he wrote in “Seven Lessons.”</p><p>In the 1990s, as chairman of industry association AdvaMed, George helped work out a deal that led to passage of the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act.</p><p>It helped speed up the review process and set clearer performance standards for medical devices seeking approval. In exchange, applicants must pay a user fee, which companies opposed because they viewed it as a tax, George says. He contends that the result is better quality.</p><p>He isn’t a big fan of many of the new regulations that have come down under the Obama administration. George, in his media appearances, has sometimes sharply criticized the president’s policies.</p><p>Still, he believes that, even under regulatory duress, business leaders can make choices. He points out that some financial firms — like Goldman Sachs, on whose board he now sits — saw the danger of overplaying the real-estate bubble and were willing to sacrifice short-term gains for long-term survival.</p><p>And while businesses may justly complain that bad rules — like the Community Reinvestment Act — set the conditions for the meltdown, George argues that making the wrong choices only brings more rules and more interference.</p><p>“In a free-enterprise system, corporations are chartered by society and endowed with certain rights and responsibilities,” he wrote in the Jan. 16 entry of his blog at BillGeorge.org. “Those that fail to contribute to society may find their charters withdrawn or their freedom to operate restricted.”</p><p>For George, “corporate responsibility” isn’t just doing charity work on the side, but must be in the core of every business.</p><p><strong>Death And Life</strong></p><strong>Death And Life</strong><p>He points to when he joined Medtronic and how he recalled a traumatic time 15 years earlier, when illnesses took both his mother and his fiancee within 18 months of each other. He had wanted to be CEO of a big company, which Medtronic was not back then. Yet its mission to save the lives of sick people brought him into a cause larger than his personal ambitions.</p><p>Over and over, George found that other great business leaders see their work the same way. CEOs with big egos may flourish for a while, but their companies often suffer from low morale, corruption and sometimes spectacular flame-outs. A relationship of mutual trust among managers, employees and customers leads to success in the long run, he firmly believes.</p><p>Warren Bennis, chairman of the Leadership Institute at the University of Southern California, author of “Still Surprised: A Memoir of a Life in Leadership,” and a George friend and editor, told IBD: “I think Bill George, perhaps more than any other CEO, has made the best case I know of for leadership to create the social architecture where people will be open and candid with one another, and where the CEO realizes that leadership and being a fully integrated person have something in common.”</p><p>George illustrated this during the 1993 attempt at government-mandated universal health care.</p><p>Fears of price caps on Medtronic’s devices led the company to massive cost cuts, including a companywide salary freeze. It also eliminated executive perks like company cars and airplanes, reserved parking spaces and club memberships. Those particular items didn’t cost that much money, but the move emphasized to all employees that management wasn’t profiting at their expense.</p><p><strong>After The Health Care Flop</strong></p><strong>After The Health Care Flop</strong><p>Medtronic’s sacrifices weren’t in vain. The cost cuts put the company in a good position to take market share and fund future expansion. With the help of buyouts in the late 1990s, it became a major global player.</p><p>“Bill led the company through a complex and vibrant period of growth and global expansion, and he continues to serve as a great ambassador of the Medtronic Mission with his passionate advocacy for innovation and ethical leadership,” current Medtronic CEO Bill Hawkins wrote in an email to IBD.</p><p>Operating in a worldwide market brings its own ethical hazards. As firms find more growth coming from emerging markets like China and Brazil, their managers are often tempted to “go native” in practices like bribery and worker treatment as well, George noted.</p><p>“The key is creating a cultural ethic for your company that all employees agree supersedes their own cultural norms,” he said. “This is a big challenge. I had to go through some different managers in Latin America and Asia who didn’t seem to understand this. But eventually we got it right.”</p><p>During the boom times, like the dot-com bubble of the 1990s and the real-estate explosion of the past decade, George’s message of ethics and near-term sacrifices could seem like a wet blanket.</p><p>He says he hopes new leaders learn from their elders’ mistakes: “We’ve had this era where we had very short-term CEOs — three or four years — and you can’t get the job done in that time. I think most people coming into the job today are looking forward to trying to build the company for 10 years and they’re very focused on how they can change their organization. That’s a big change from 2007.”</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Management/LeadersInSuccess.aspx\">Investor’s Business Daily</a><br>March 31, 2011</p><a href=\"http://www.investors.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Management/LeadersInSuccess.aspx\">Investor’s Business Daily</a><br><p>&nbsp;</p>"

      "<p>Louis A. Simpson epitomizes the graying of U.S. corporate boardrooms.</p><p>He will soon join the board of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=CHK\">Chesapeake Energy</a>&nbsp;Corp. at the ripe young age of 74. The former Geico Corp. president and chief executive of capital operations can serve until he turns 80, the mandatory retirement age for directors of the natural-gas producer.</p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=CHK\">Chesapeake Energy</a><p>While most boards today force members to retire at 72, 19% of the biggest businesses with board age limits now set them at 75 or older—up from 8% in 2005 and 1% in 2000, according to a recent study by recruiters Spencer Stuart.</p><p>The number of boards with elderly members likely will grow, partly because businesses fear “they won’t be able to recruit as many experienced directors,” says Julie Daum, co-leader of the search firm’s North American board practice.</p><p>The higher retirement ages are sparking criticism, however. “It is a troubling trend because it may encourage the tenure of long-term directors who have lost their outside perspective,” contends William Patterson, executive director of CtW Investment Group, an arm of labor federation Change to Win. “Entrenched board members make it harder to bring in fresh oversight,” he says.</p><p>The Spencer Stuart study, released in late 2010, reported the smallest number of independent directors picked for companies in the Standard &amp; Poor’s 500-stock index for any year since 2001. Many boards, wary of tapping untested newcomers during the downturn, “held on to existing directors by increasing or waiving retirement ages,” Ms. Daum explains.</p><p>Businesses lifting board age limits also cite the reduced ranks of chief executives taking outside directorships. “It has gotten very complicated to be a board member,” because a directorship is a “serious responsibility,” says Myron “Mike” E. Ullman, CEO of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=JCP\">J.C. Penney</a>&nbsp;Co. and a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=SBUX\">Starbucks</a>&nbsp;Corp. director. For now, he won’t accept another public-company seat. Penney raised directors’ retirement age to 74 from 72 in February 2009 so the retailer could better compete for talent, Mr. Ullman continues.</p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=JCP\">J.C. Penney</a><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=SBUX\">Starbucks</a><p>At the same time, retired corporate leaders “who stay actively engaged are among the best board members,” and so companies want them to serve longer than 70, says William W. George, a Harvard business school professor and retired chief of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=MDT\">Medtronic</a>&nbsp;Inc. “Seventy is the new 50,” quips the 68-year-old director of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=XOM\">ExxonMobil</a>&nbsp;Corp. and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=GS\">Goldman Sachs Group</a>&nbsp;Inc.</p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=MDT\">Medtronic</a><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=XOM\">ExxonMobil</a><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=GS\">Goldman Sachs Group</a><p>Board members at Goldman increased the retirement age by three years to 75 in December 2009. The move helped retain&nbsp;<a href=\"http://topics.wsj.com/person/b/john-bryan/912\">John H. Bryan</a>, the presiding independent director who “adds wisdom and maturity to the board,” someone familiar with the situation says.</p><a href=\"http://topics.wsj.com/person/b/john-bryan/912\">John H. Bryan</a><p>Mr. Bryan, a retired CEO of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=SLE\">Sara Lee</a>&nbsp;Corp., previously got a one-year waiver from Goldman Sachs after reaching 72 in October 2008. A Goldman Sachs spokesman says he declined to comment.</p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=SLE\">Sara Lee</a><p>A similar desire to keep a key board player persuaded&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=UAL\">UAL</a>&nbsp;Corp. to boost mandatory retirement to 75 from 73 in 2009. “We didn’t want to lose the services of Jim O’ Connor,” recalls Robert S. “Steve” Miller, a director.</p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=UAL\">UAL</a><p>Mr. O’Connor, a retired head of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=EXC\">Unicom</a>&nbsp;Corp., joined the airline’s board in 1984 and runs the nominating and corporate-governance committee of the recently renamed&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=UAL\">United Continental Holdings</a>&nbsp;Inc.

It “becomes an invitation for directors to hang around when several need to step down” at a company like Chesapeake with a poor governance record, he says. “These directors feel very protected in their roles, and so they don’t heed shareholder criticisms of their governance.”</p><p>Indeed, two Chesapeake directors encountered strong reelection opposition last year but were retained anyway. The company had ignored a successful but nonbinding 2009 shareholder resolution favoring annual election of board members, citing the natural-gas industry’s volatility. The three-year terms for directors make it hard for outsiders to push for change.</p><p>The board “has worked to improve our corporate governance,” Mr. Rome replies.</p><p>Investor unhappiness over too many older directors spurred a short-lived proxy fight at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=OXY\">Occidental Petroleum</a>&nbsp;Corp. last year. Directors raised mandatory retirement to 75 from 72 in 2004, but didn’t enforce it, according to a spokesman for the oil and gas concern.</p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=OXY\">Occidental Petroleum</a><p>Two prominent activists—Relational Investors LLC and the California State Teachers’ Retirement System—launched a contest partly because Occidental failed to announce a CEO succession plan and instead waived the retirement-age rule for CEO&nbsp;<a href=\"http://topics.wsj.com/person/i/ray-irani/1096\">Ray Irani</a>&nbsp;and two fellow directors at last spring’s annual meeting. He avoided the fight by agreeing to step down this May. The 76-year-old executive remains chairman until the end of 2014. Occidental no longer intends to grant retirement waivers, the spokesman adds.</p><a href=\"http://topics.wsj.com/person/i/ray-irani/1096\">Ray Irani</a><p>Certain boards assure fresh faces by focusing on tenure as well as birthdays.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=DIS\">Walt Disney</a>&nbsp;Co. board members, for instance, must exit after serving 15 years or hitting 74. “A long-time director becomes vested in the existing company strategy and has trouble adjusting to necessary strategic changes,” suggests Gary Wilson. He left Disney’s board in 2006 after 21 years and previously offering to quit.</p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=DIS\">Walt Disney</a><p>Governance experts see rigorous yearly evaluations of individual directors as a better way to replace poor performers. The practice remains rare, however. “It is very difficult to tell someone you have outgrown your usefulness,” notes Mr. Miller, chairman of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=AIG\">American International Group</a>&nbsp;Inc.</p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=AIG\">American International Group</a><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Source: </strong><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703905404576164791847168546.html?KEYWORDS=Joann+Lublin#printMode\">Wall Street Journal&nbsp;</a><br><strong>Author: </strong>Joann Lublin<br><strong>Date: </strong>February 28, 2011</p><strong>Source: </strong><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703905404576164791847168546.html?KEYWORDS=Joann+Lublin#printMode\">Wall Street Journal&nbsp;</a><br><strong>Author: </strong><br><strong>Date: </strong>"

      "<p>Apple CEO Steve Jobs’s decision to take a medical leave of absence and the ensuing stock-market tremors sparked debate over the balance between Jobs’s right to privacy and the needs of investors to evaluate his company.&nbsp;</p><p>Writing in The Atlantic online, General Electric’s former counsel, Ben Heineman, led the charge by arguing that Jobs is legally required to disclose the nature of his illness.&nbsp;</p><p>“The right to privacy of a CEO about medical conditions should be outweighed by the need for disclosure under certain conditions,” he wrote. Heineman went on to urge the Securities and Exchange Commission to establish stricter rules for disclosing illnesses to investors.&nbsp;</p><p>The SEC declined to comment on whether it is considering such a move, but analysts say any new regulation would be complicated.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the commission requires relatively immediate disclosure in some circumstances–including the retirement, resignation, or termination of top company officials–Jobs’s situation doesn’t fall neatly into any category.&nbsp;</p><p>Under SEC regulations, a company must reveal when a principal financial officer temporarily turns his or her duties over to another person. In the extreme event that a CEO dies, the rules do not require a company to report the death.&nbsp;</p><p>A company may voluntarily report a top official’s health problem if it affects operations in a “material” way.&nbsp;</p><p>If federal regulators were to consider stricter health rules, they would likely need to determine what affects a stockholder’s investment in a material way, said Brian Breheny, a former SEC official and current partner at Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom.&nbsp;</p><p>“For those at the SEC, the question would become, ‘What is the trigger?’ ” he told National Journal. “Regulators would have to decide where the line is and when something becomes material.”&nbsp;</p><p>Jobs may be considered personally critical to Apple’s success, but the same can’t be said for CEOs of every company, and government rules would need to apply the same criteria across the board, Breheny said.&nbsp;</p><p>Harvard Business School professor&nbsp;Bill George&nbsp;said that although Jobs is an “irreplaceable icon” who has greater-than-average sway over his company’s future, no new government regulations are needed.&nbsp;</p><p>“I don’t know what more information they could disclose,” he said, noting that in Jobs’s case, the full extent of the illness may not yet be known. “As opposed to past cases, Apple has been as forthright as they should be.”&nbsp;</p><p>Continued updates on the CEO’s condition would be in order,&nbsp;George&nbsp;said, but only if they reduce uncertainty.&nbsp;</p><p>As to Jobs’s future with Apple, “As long as he is breathing, he will be on top of it,”&nbsp;George&nbsp;said. “We shouldn’t underestimate what that company can do.”</p>"

      "<p>BOSTON—From the problems posed by the Great Recession to the devastation in Haiti and the Gulf of Mexico, from the continuing economic growth of India and China to a cascade of entrepreneurial ventures, the year 2010 offered a wide assortment of accomplishments and disappointments. We asked three Harvard Business School professors—former Medtronic chairman and CEO&nbsp;<strong>Bill George</strong>, economist and entrepreneurship expert&nbsp;<strong>Bill Sahlman</strong>, and innovation and strategy authority&nbsp;<strong>Rosabeth Moss Kanter</strong>–to offer their thoughts on some of the year’s most significant developments in the world of business and economics.</p><strong>Bill George</strong><strong>Bill Sahlman</strong><strong>Rosabeth Moss Kanter</strong><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/news/releases/facultyonbusiness2010.html\">Bill George, Professor of Management Practice</a></strong></p><strong><a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/news/releases/facultyonbusiness2010.html\">Bill George, Professor of Management Practice</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/news/releases/facultyonbusiness2010.html\">Bill George, Professor of Management Practice</a><p>Social networking is the most significant business development of 2010, topping the resurgence of the U.S. automobile industry. During the year social networking morphed from a personal communications tool for young people into a new vehicle that business leaders are using to transform communications with their employees and customers, as it shifts from one-way transmission of information to two-way<em>interaction</em>. That’s one reason&nbsp;<em>Time</em>&nbsp;magazine just named Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg Person of the Year.</p><em>interaction</em><em>Time</em><p>A year ago many people poked fun at Facebook as a place where kids shared their latest party news. Today more than 600 million users worldwide are active on the site. The most rapidly growing demographic is people over forty. More than 300 million people spend at least one hour a day on Facebook. Approximately two hundred million people are active on Twitter in spite of – or because of – its 140-character limitation. Another 100 million use LinkedIn. None of these social networks even existed at the beginning of the decade.</p><p>Leaders like IBM’s Sam Palmisano, PepsiCo’s Indra Nooyi, Apple’s Steve Jobs, Microsoft’s Steve Ballmer, Carlson’s Marilyn Nelson, and Harvard Business School Dean Nitin Nohria are all active social network users. Why? Because these social networks are a unique way of broadly communicating real-time messages to the audiences they want to reach. They can write a message anywhere, anytime, and share it with interested parties” without any public relations meddling, speech writers, airplane travel, canned videos, or voicemail messages. Now their words are much more authentic and can be remarkably empowering.</p><p>Social networking is also flattening organizations by distributing access to information. Everyone is equal on the social network. No hierarchies need get involved.</p><p>The biggest threat presented by social networks is to middle managers, who may become obsolete when layers of managers are no longer needed to convey messages up and down the organization. The key to success in the social networking era is to empower the people who do the actual work–designing products, manufacturing them, creating marketing innovations, or selling services–to step up and lead without a hierarchy.</p><p>Consumer marketing companies are lining up to use these networks to reach their tailored demographics with highly personalized messages. Already they are revolutionizing marketing by shifting dollars from purchased media advertisements to building their own outlets and content. Kraft Foods, for example, is now one of the largest publishers of food-related materials. IBM is launching thought leadership communities. PepsiCo uses social networks to reach millions of social entrepreneurs in lieu of advertising at the Super Bowl. From a leadership perspective, social networking is making authentic leadership a reality and a necessity for 21st century leaders. You can’t hide on your social network when you’re revealing who you are and what you really believe. Transparency is essential here.</p><p>Even more important, this new phenomenon is enabling business leaders to regain the trust and credibility they have lost over the last ten years. That’s why social networking is the most important business development of the year.</p><p><strong>William A. Sahlman, Dimitri V. D’Arbeloff-MBA Class of 1955 Professor of Business Administration</strong></p><strong>William A. Sahlman, Dimitri V. D’Arbeloff-MBA Class of 1955 Professor of Business Administration</strong><p>From where I sit as an economist, it’s still all about the economy and the long-term impact of the problems laid bare by the Great Recession. During the financial crisis, the world came to the apparently shocking realization that debt financing entails risks. Financial institutions, households, and governments all suffered because they had too much leverage.</p><p>Though the corporate sector has generally decreased leverage, the same is not true of government, particularly in the United States. Every company and household here and abroad will ultimately be affected by the unabated and accelerating gap between government revenues and spending.</p><p>There is a great deal of confusion in the popular media about the level of the current budget deficit and outstanding debt. To illustrate, most press reports peg the current U.S. deficit at $1.5 trillion, roughly 10% of gross domestic product (GDP). Gross public debt is $14 trillion, or over 95% of GDP. Most observers believe that the government will run a sustained deficit for the next decade that could add over $10 trillion to outstanding federal debt.</p><p>But closer inspection of government data reveals that these figures grossly understate both the current deficit and level of debt. Consider, for example, that the estimated net present value of obligations under the Social Security system is approximately $8 trillion. As the ratio of retired people receiving benefits to working people paying into the system increases, there will be an ever-increasing deficit confronting the government.</p><p>Even more problematic is the fact that the Medicare system has a vested unfunded net liability of approximately $38 trillion. Once again, the inexorable shift in demographics, combined with high and increasing healthcare costs, will result in a widening gap between tax intake and payment outflow for Medicare.</p><p>On another front, the government is also on the hook for insuring bank deposits (including money market funds at the peak of the crisis), pension liabilities, and a wide range of other loans and liabilities. The total value of explicit loan guarantees is well over $10 trillion.</p><p>In total, the estimated liabilities of the federal government are in the range of $70 trillion, over five times annual GDP. By implication, the annual deficit is equal to the reported deficit plus the change in the vested, unfunded liabilities incurred in that year (e.g., the change in the Medicare liability) plus the implicit net cost of the annual guarantee for various liabilities. Therefore, the current deficit is more like $4.5 trillion than $1.5 trillion, while the total net revenue for the government was only $2.2 trillion in fiscal 2009. Washington, we have a problem.</p><p>This kind of leverage is unsustainable. Though some will argue that higher taxes are required, the reality is that the total amount collected each year in personal and corporate taxes (excluding social security and Medicare taxes) is only a bit over $1 trillion. Spending must be cut.</p><p>The recent report of The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform suggested a number of options for addressing the challenges posed by excessive government leverage. This report, and several others prepared by other objective bodies, must become part of our collective dialogue about the future of the country. Every business leader and every citizen has a responsibility to understand and help address these issues. Otherwise, as some scenarios in Europe have already made clear, the United States will ultimately suffer the same fate as all countries that spend way beyond their means.</p><p><strong>Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Ernest L. Arbuckle Professor of Business Administration</strong></p><strong>Rosabeth Moss Kanter, Ernest L. Arbuckle Professor of Business Administration</strong><p>In many ways the biggest business developments of 2010 were the things that didn’t happen. Big companies with cash didn’t spend it. Banks with cash didn’t lend it. Small businesses didn’t attract capital and thus didn’t help reduce unemployment. Europeans were paralyzed by debt crises and transportation shutdowns caused by volcanic ash and disgruntled workers. Americans were paralyzed by fear of a Chinese takeover of the world. Google didn’t exactly leave China or prevail in the face-off over government-banned content. The BP oil spill debacle in the U.S. Gulf region didn’t destroy the company, didn’t stop offshore oil drilling for very long, and didn’t produce the political will to push for alternative energy sources.</p><p>Yet even in the midst of gridlock in Washington, economic anxiety around the world, and government liquidity crises in Europe, technology marched on, seemingly impervious to global events. Technology companies with the capabilities and courage to innovate were bright spots and signals of important trends for the future.</p><p>One enormous continuing development is the exponential growth of social networking media and the increasing use of social media by companies to crowdsource ideas, mount contests to award prizes and gather audiences, and attempt to create dialogues with customers. The year 2010 accelerated the trend toward the use of social networking sites for an increasing number of commercial purposes and gave social networking companies the confidence to remain independent rather than be acquired by existing players (witness upstart Groupon’s recent rejection of Google’s $6 billion offer, for instance).</p><p>And for what it symbolizes, let me add the launch of the Apple iPad in April. This device quickly gained a 95% share of the tablet computer market and a big share of the public mind.</p><p>But the iPad represented more than just an extremely successful product launch. It also signified important technological directions that are reshaping other industries. The iPad extends and accelerates the webification of life whereby devices can connect to the “cloud” and provide functions on a mobile, as-needed basis. There is no more need to embed them in the guts of a stationary device. This makes an enormous amount of computing power available to individuals and small businesses and continues the importance of apps that can be accessed directly. The existence of the iPad extends and accelerates the trend toward digital content such as e-books and downloadable newspapers and magazines.</p><p>While uncertainty continues to cause wary businesses to wait before investing, innovation and entrepreneurship are invoked by leaders as the one sure way out of economic distress.</p><p><strong>About Harvard Business School:</strong><br>Founded in 1908 as part of Harvard University,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/\">Harvard Business School</a>&nbsp;is located on a 40-acre campus in Boston.

      "<p>It isn’t easy being CEO of a public company. The glamour days of CEO rock stars and high-flying stock prices are gone. Companies are under constant scrutiny by activist investors, aggressive regulators, aggrieved customers and aggravated employees. As the public face of their companies, CEOs bear the brunt of that criticism.</p><p>Today the Twin Cities are blessed with a bumper crop of CEOs — the best group in my 40 years here. From U.S. Bancorp’s Richard Davis, Cargill’s Greg Page, Best Buy’s Brian Dunn and 3M’s George Buckley to General Mills’ Ken Powell, Medtronic’s Bill Hawkins and Ecolab’s Doug Baker, these CEOs are building great enterprises and leadership in their industries.</p><p>But none has faced the challenges that awaited Target CEO Gregg Steinhafel when he stepped into the shoes of predecessor Bob Ulrich. Serving on Target’s board from 1993 to 2005, I watched Ulrich transform the company from a multiformat retailer into a focused mass merchant. Thanks to Steinhafel’s merchandising genius, Target has found a sustainable niche a cut above Wal-Mart with creative offerings others can’t match in value.</p><p>Steinhafel became Target’s CEO in May 2008, just as the economy was sinking into recession. Hard times caused shoppers to be more frugal. Wal-Mart attacked Target’s core merchandising business.</p><p>More recently, Target survived what many consider a faux pas in supporting MN Forward’s pro-jobs campaign. Funds wound up supporting gubernatorial candidate Tom Emmer, who has taken anti-gay policy positions. GLBT organizations feared Target was abandoning its pro-gay stands.</p><p>Steinhafel had barely moved into the CEO’s chair when Target’s strategy was challenged by activist investor William Ackman. Buying up 7.8 percent of Target shares at retail’s peak in July 2007, Ackman watched his holdings slide as retail stocks fell.</p><p>Ackman demanded that Target spin off its credit cards. After lengthy discussions, Target’s board sold half of its card operations but retained management control. Ackman initially congratulated Steinhafel on the move, but later demanded that Target sell off the remaining 50 percent. Steinhafel and the board refused.</p><p>Next Ackman proposed that Target transfer the land and buildings that house Target stores into a real estate investment trust. That would have increased Target’s operating costs by $1.4 billion and split control over its real estate and merchandising arms. Steinhafel and the board were steadfast in rejecting Ackman’s financial engineering ploys.</p><p>Ackman responded with a proxy contest to replace four Target directors with his slate of five directors. While Target took the high road, Ackman went for the jugular, attacking long-standing directors like Wells Fargo Chair Richard Kovacevich for being “complacent.” Neither Steinhafel nor the board flinched.</p><p>Instead of challenging Ackman, Steinhafel met with Target’s major shareholders.</p><p>Before the votes were counted at Target’s 2009 annual meeting, Ackman gave a speech invoking the likes of John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King. Shareholders apparently didn’t buy his act. More than 70 percent of votes were cast for the Target directors.</p><p>Always classy, Steinhafel shook Ackman’s hand and said the proxy battle provided him the opportunity to spend extra time with Target shareholders.</p><p>The criticisms of Target’s contributions to MN Forward were perhaps more painful than either Ackman’s attacks or Wal-Mart challenges. Suggestions that Target was somehow “anti-gay” cut deeply. The worst one could say about this incident is that Steinhafel may have been naive. But he admitted his mistake and reaffirmed the company’s long-standing support for gay rights. As he told me, “Target has the most gay-friendly policies in this state.”</p><p>Despite these challenges, Steinhafel never took his focus off merchandising. In the past 18 months, he has led a sharp turnaround from shrinking same-store sales during the recession. Shareholders have responded by driving up Target shares from lows of $26 in 2008 to $59 last week.</p><p>For all the challenges it has faced, Target has never lost sight of pleasing its customers, nor has it wavered in its commitment to give 5 percent of earnings to philanthropic causes. Most important of all, Target created 30,000 jobs in Minnesota in the last 30 years.</p><p>For CEOs of major companies like Target, there will always be challenges, disappointments, and missteps. The bottom-line measurement is, did you create sustainable value for your customers, employees, shareholders and your communities? The record is clear: Steinhafel is excelling in all four categories.</p><p>Bill George serves on the boards of Exxon Mobil and Goldman Sachs and previously served on the Novartis and Target boards.

Ahead of the crucial, mid-term vote, 10 of the world’s top professors of leadership and management have assessed Obama against some of the core tenants of leadership — vision, execution and results. While these leadership gurus have given Obama passing marks, he is far from an A student.</p><p><strong> Vision </strong></p><strong> Vision </strong><p>President Obama earned a B+ for setting a strategy and communicating and selling his goals to Americans. The grades were inspired heavily by the way his speeches galvanized voters on the 2008 campaign trail.</p><p>At the gate, faculty judged Obama as a masterful orator, delivering clear messages that Americans could relate to and believe in. “Yes we can,” peppered with a few “hows” gave voters a sense that Obama was capable of just about anything — check one for any leader hoping to inspire loyalty.</p><p>So strong was the buy-in that some professors used his campaign and victory speeches as fodder for classroom discussions about good communication.</p><p>“I showed my students his victory speech,” says Manfred F. R. Kets De Vries, director of INSEAD’s Global Leadership Centre. “It was moving. People don’t realize that you cannot over communicate.”</p><p>But Obama as a candidate compared with Obama as president has given some faculty pause.</p><p>“His campaign speeches gave the American people hope that he would not work with lobbyists and that he would change Washington,” recalls Bill George, a professor at Harvard Business School. “When he was in office, the first thing he did was cut deals with lobbyists for health care. So the people started listening to what other people said he was doing, rather than to what he said he was doing.”</p><p>Broken promises are worthy of a dunce cap in George’s eyes, causing him to drop Obama’s grade from what would have been an A in 2009 to a C-.</p><p>And his current rhetoric is missing a key ingredient — a fresh vision for a recession-battered country.</p><p>“I assumed on January 20, perhaps naively, that he’d give us a vision of where the country was going to go, and would set that out as a long-term plan,” George says. “He chose not to do that, nor has he done so since.”</p><p>As Obama moved from the campaign to governance, he made another key communication gaffe.</p><p>“We know that if you’re in a crisis, the last thing you need to do is motivate people by giving a sense of their standing on a burning platform,” says Yale’s Jeffrey Sonnenfeld. “He needs to start giving us a comprehensive vision on how we’re going to get out of this crisis. Otherwise, people feel fear.”</p><p>Sonnenfeld gives Obama a B+ “for honoring his campaign commitments on health care and economic stabilization. He showed a steady hand and rescued some key industries. But the nation’s priorities are a moving target, and he cannot lost sight of that.”</p><p>University of Michigan’s Noel Tichy is still waiting for Obama to deliver what “a teachable point of view” in the style of Jack Welch, former chairman and CEO of GE.</p><p>“Jack Welch’s motto was speed, simplicity and self confidence,” Tichy says, recalling his time at the helm of General Electric’s leadership academy, Crotonville. “Self-confident leaders can make things simple. Franklin Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan were masters at it. Now we’ve got a leader who needs to learn that lesson.”</p><p>While President George W. Bush faced criticism for being overly simplistic as a speaker, Obama is gaining a reputation for the opposite.</p><p>“When you read Obama’s speeches, they’re beautiful,” says Warren Bennis, of USC’s Marshall School of Business. “They’ll go down as some of the most brilliant essays. But none of them has a sound bite. Where is Reagan’s, ‘Mr. Gorbachev tear down that wall?'”</p><p>Lacking that, the media yawns when he delivers amazing speeches, such as his December 2009 acceptance speech for the Nobel Peace Prize, Bennis says.</p><p>The solution? Tichy prescribes the same basics he shares with his students: “Make a case for change and how we’re going to get there. Don’t make it convoluted.”</p><p><strong> Execution </strong></p><strong> Execution </strong><p>Execution can be a thorny subject for executives and politicians like Barack Obama: it’s no good having a new product or idea if you cannot get it out the door.</p><p>On execution, faculty have delivered the most criticism of Obama’s performance, scrawling a B- across his mid-term report.</p><p>Under fire are his priorities, the people advising him, and a growing rift between the West Wing and Wall Street.</p><p>The leadership experts give mixed marks for Obama’s initial priorities. USC’s Bennis awards Obama an A for execution, but says that Obama should have begun his term with a focus on job creation.</p><p>“That would have gotten people to the polls. Compare that to what Roosevelt did in the mid-1930s by creating the Civilian Conservation Corp (CCC), which in a week’s time brought millions of people to work. That’s where people’s visceral strings ares,” says Bennis.</p><p>Bennis, who campaigned for Roosevelt in the 1930s, commends Obama for getting “a hell of a lot done, but not the things that people experience every day.”</p><p><iframe src=\"http://money.cnn.com/.element/ssi/video/4.0/players/story.player.html?p=0&amp;d=88687212\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"384\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></p><iframe src=\"http://money.cnn.com/.element/ssi/video/4.0/players/story.player.html?p=0&amp;d=88687212\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"384\" height=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe><p>“It’s time for Obama to rethink his priorities,” says Michael Useem, director of the Wharton School’s Center for Leadership and Change Management.</p><p>To do that, Obama might subscribe to one of the basic tenants of sound leadership — forming a diverse team of advisors, from a mix of professional and theoretical backgrounds, who aren’t afraid to second-guess their Commander-in-Chief.</p><p>“Leadership 101 is remembering that you sit in the Oval Office, but it’s the direct reports who make the policies rise or fall,” says Useem. “In that sense, the team is more important than any individual in it.”</p><p>One of his lowest marks, a C, comes from Harvard’s Bill George. Obama’s lack of experience in business requires a safe ring of seasoned advisors by his side, according to George.</p><p>“Instead, he surrounded himself with a narrow team of people he’d worked closely with for years. Every leader needs to make sure that they surround themselves with skills they don’t have,” George says.</p><p>Other appointments that baffle George? Obama’s National Security Advisor, Thomas Donilon, and secretary of health and human services, Kathleen Sebelius, the former Governor of Kansas who wields little experience in health care.</p><p>Obama cannot afford to turn a deaf ear to business leaders, says Sonnenfeld.</p><p>“We have a very progressive generation of business leaders right now that want to help and are being ignored. People like Anne Mulcahy, Jaime Dimon, Jim McNerney, Jr. of Boeing, and Klaus Kleinfeld of Alcoa. Even Warren Buffet hasn’t been brought into the discussions,” Sonnenfeld says.</p><p><strong> Results </strong></p><strong> Results </strong><p>In giving Obama a B for results, the leadership gurus said they were impressed with what the president has accomplished, despite significant strains on his policies from both sides of the political spectrum.</p><p>“When he assumed office, he was facing probably the most difficult, complex, and long-range problems that any president in U.S. history — possibly with the exception of George Washington — has ever faced,” says USC’s Bennis. “I don’t recall a president who’s had as negative and divisive a Congress in the last 100 years. How can he accomplish so much given the Congress, the Supreme Court, and the Great Recession? He’s done a remarkable job.”</p><p><strong>Other professors craved more.</strong></p><strong>Other professors craved more.</strong><p>&nbsp;</p><p>“He has averted what could have been the worst recession that any of us have ever experienced,” says Angel Cabrera, president of the Thunderbird School of Global Management. “To me, that’s an amazing accomplishment. But it’s hard to sell. People are hurting and you’re telling them, ‘be happy you’re only hurting a little bit, because the alternative could have been disastrous.'”</p><p>No matter how you tally his results, they are still invisible to most Americans, warns Deborah Ancona, a professor at MIT’s Sloan School of Management and head of the MIT Leadership Center.</p><p>“What people see is high unemployment, services being cut by local government, and huge debt,” Ancona says.</p><p>That’s a shame, Ancona says, awarding him a B.</p><p>“We have to give this man credit for passing health care legislation, getting some educational and financial regulation reform through, cutting the financial crisis short and cutting forces in Iraq, despite the odds.”</p><p>The shelf life of Obama’s results is also questionable. Susan Ashford, Professor of Management and Organizations at Michigan’s Ross School, says, “he got health care through, but it’s not through solidly. Everyone’s chipping away at it. It doesn’t feel as if we’ve changed something.”</p><p>His harshest critique — a C — came from Jeffrey Pfeffer, a professor of organizational behavior at Stanford. “A stimulus that didn’t stimulate, but that nonetheless raised the deficit; financial regulation that didn’t really fix things; and health care reform that didn’t go far enough. Most of it doesn’t go into effect for years, so you get the criticism now and the benefits much later. Bad idea.”</p><p><strong> Goodbye Mr. Nice Guy? </strong></p><strong> Goodbye Mr. Nice Guy? </strong><p>So is it time for President Obama to change course and take a tougher stance with opponents?</p><p>“When you go into a thick lawn of grass, you have to pull the machine back and come in with more speed to cut the lawn,” says Wharton’s Useem. “After the November election, there will be a momentary pulling back and a decision not to waver in the mission but rather to adjust the tactics.”</p><p>Other faculty are dubious that Obama will alter his inner circle enough to really shake up his priorities.&nbsp;<em>The Wall Street Journal</em>&nbsp;reported on October 15 that White House officials were no longer looking to fill Larry Summer’s shoes with a corporate chieftain, adding fuel to the fire brewing between Obama and the very people who sign off on U.S. jobs.</p><em>The Wall Street Journal</em><p>It may be time for Obama to toughen up.</p><p>“Likeability is overrated. Contrary to much conventional wisdom, compromise often doesn’t work — because in the end, no one is happy,” says Stanford’s Pfeiffer.</p><p>If Obama can set a new vision and manage the story of his presidency while honing his execution skills, the professors measuring Obama’s leadership credentials might just boost his grade point average before 2012.</p>"

All too often these leaders have placed self-interest ahead of the well-being of their organizations.&nbsp; After the companies got in trouble, their leaders then refused to take responsibility for the harm caused to the people they served. The problems at British Petroleum, Hewlett-Packard, and failed Wall Street firms, along with the actions of dozens of leaders who failed in the post-Enron era, are glaring examples of these lapses in leadership.</p><p>As a result, there has been a widespread loss of trust in business and political leaders in the past decade. Reactions to these issues range from anger and despair to more generalized suspicion of institutions and their leaders. The Harvard Center for Public Leadership&nbsp;<em style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">2009 National Leadership Index&nbsp;</em>revealed that 69 percent of those surveyed believe there is a leadership crisis in the U.S., with politicians, media, finance, and business leaders getting the lowest ratings. European studies report similar results.</p><em>2009 National Leadership Index&nbsp;</em><p><span style=\"color: #800000; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\"><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">“In the past two decades far too many leaders have been selected more for charisma than character, for style over substance, and for image rather than integrity.”</strong></span></p><span><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">“In the past two decades far too many leaders have been selected more for charisma than character, for style over substance, and for image rather than integrity.”</strong></span><strong>“In the past two decades far too many leaders have been selected more for charisma than character, for style over substance, and for image rather than integrity.”</strong><p>Once lost, trust is very hard to regain. The root cause of the problem rests not with having strong leaders, but in choosing the wrong leaders for the wrong reasons. In the past two decades far too many leaders have been selected more for charisma than character, for style over substance, and for image rather than integrity. If charisma, style and image are the selection criteria, why are we surprised when leaders turn out to lack character, substance and integrity?<br style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\"><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\"><br style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">Leadership’s lost decade</strong></p><br><strong><br style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">Leadership’s lost decade</strong><br><p>The past ten years have seen so many leadership letdowns that this period can appropriately be characterized as “Leadership’s Lost Decade.”<span style=\"color: #ff9900; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\"><sup style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">1</sup></span>&nbsp;Failed leadership led to the dot.com collapse of 2002, resulted in hundreds of leaders acknowledging accounting misstatements following the bankruptcies of Enron and WorldCom, and caused the meltdown of global financial markets in 2008 that triggered the Great Recession and the ongoing jobs crisis.</p><span><sup style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">1</sup></span><sup>1</sup><p>These failures—which destroyed so many strong organizations—occurred because leaders focused on short-term results and rewards while placing their personal needs ahead of the organizations and institutions they were charged with leading. Since retiring from Medtronic in 2002, I have been studying where these leaders of my generation went astray and what will be required to develop better leaders in the future.</p><p>In examining these failures, I cannot identify a single leader who failed due to lack of intelligence (IQ). On the contrary, the unsuccessful leaders I have observed in person or through their words and deeds appear to have failed due to low levels of emotional intelligence (EQ).</p><p>Many failed leaders seem to lack an awareness of themselves and their actions.&nbsp; Often they do not have a deep understanding of their motivations, and they have not fully accepted their crucibles – fears and failures emanating from earlier experiences, many of which date back to childhood. These characteristics often cause leaders to lose sight of their values, especially when they are under pressure to sustain their success. In other cases, leaders who lack self-awareness get seduced by success and its rewards – money, power, and recognition.</p><p><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">A new generation of authentic leaders<br style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\"></strong></p><strong>A new generation of authentic leaders<br style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\"></strong><br><p><span style=\"color: #800000; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\"><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">“Authentic leaders are genuine in their intentions and understand the purpose of their leadership is serving their customers, employees and investors, not their self-interest.”</strong></span></p><span><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">“Authentic leaders are genuine in their intentions and understand the purpose of their leadership is serving their customers, employees and investors, not their self-interest.”</strong></span><strong>“Authentic leaders are genuine in their intentions and understand the purpose of their leadership is serving their customers, employees and investors, not their self-interest.”</strong><p>Authentic leaders are genuine in their intentions and understand the purpose of their leadership is serving their customers, employees and investors, not their self-interest. They must practice their values consistently, balance their extrinsic and intrinsic motivations, build trustworthy relationships, and operate with high levels of personal discipline.</p><p>The emergence of a new generation of authentic leaders must happen at all levels of organizations to rebuild confidence in corporations. In the 21<sup style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">st</sup>&nbsp;century, leaders need to empower other people to lead, rather than controlling them through hierarchies. Leaders need to inspire those around them, giving them the confidence they need to step up to leadership challenges throughout the organization.</p><sup>st</sup><p>Being authentic also requires high levels of emotional intelligence, as described by Daniel Goleman in his book by that name.<span style=\"color: #ff9900; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\"><sup style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">2</sup></span>&nbsp;The central element of EQ is self-awareness – a deep sense of oneself and one’s impact on others. In my experience most leaders struggle for many years to develop this level of self-awareness, myself included. All too often they are distracted by their desire to achieve success in the eyes of others and the recognition that comes with it.</p><span><sup style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">2</sup></span><sup>2</sup><p><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">Developing mindfulness</strong></p><strong>Developing mindfulness</strong><p>To gain a deeper understanding of how people become self-aware, I have been examining the concept of mindfulness, which Buddhists have developed through the practice of meditation.&nbsp; Mindfulness – the awareness of one’s mental processes and the understanding of how one’s mind works – offers leaders a path to address challenges and adversity in a non-judgmental, non-threatening way. It is a logical step in the process of gaining self-awareness that needs to be integrated with actual experience in leading in challenging situations and gaining awareness through feedback and group support.</p><p><span style=\"color: #800000; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\"><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">“Mindfulness enables leaders to be fully present, aware of themselves and their impact on other people, and sensitive to their reactions to stressful situations.”</strong></span></p><span><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">“Mindfulness enables leaders to be fully present, aware of themselves and their impact on other people, and sensitive to their reactions to stressful situations.”</strong></span><strong>“Mindfulness enables leaders to be fully present, aware of themselves and their impact on other people, and sensitive to their reactions to stressful situations.”</strong><p>Mindfulness enables leaders to be fully present, aware of themselves and their impact on other people, and sensitive to their reactions to stressful situations. Leaders who are mindful tend to be more effective in understanding and relating to others, and motivating them toward shared goals.</p><p>I have meditated regularly for more than thirty years, not as a religious or spiritual practice, but as a personal discipline to relieve stress. Meditation has been the single most important thing I have done to improve my leadership. It has helped me become more self-aware and more compassionate toward myself and others. It has also enabled me to remain calm and clear-thinking in the face of pressure and uncertainty.</p><p>Meditation enables people to be more aware of their circumstances, less reactive to stress, more compassionate, and better equipped to approach challenging issues in a calm, thoughtful manner. In addition to meditation, many people increase their mindfulness through prayer, introspective discussions, yoga, therapy, and reflective exercises.</p><p>New neurological research on the impact of meditation on the brain demonstrates that it can reshape the part of the brain that impacts emotional intelligence, much more so than can be done for the hard-wired elements of the brain that determine IQ.&nbsp;<em style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">&nbsp;Driven to Lead</em>,<span style=\"color: #ff9900; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\"><sup style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">3</sup></span>&nbsp;a new book by Harvard Professor-emeritus Paul Lawrence, discusses how the mind can be remodeled for leadership.</p><em>&nbsp;Driven to Lead</em><span><sup style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">3</sup></span><sup>3</sup><p>Lawrence starts with Charles Darwin’s original theory that “It is not the strongest species that survives, nor the most intelligent, but the most adaptive to change.”<span style=\"color: #ff9900; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\"><sup style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">4</sup></span>&nbsp;He extends this theory in what he terms “renewed Darwin” to the development of the mind’s leadership qualities.&nbsp; Developing clarity through mindfulness enables leaders to integrate their four drives – security, material acquisition, bonding with others, and the search for meaning – into an integrated decision-making process.</p><span><sup style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">4</sup></span><sup>4</sup><p><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">Mindful leadership: A new way to sustain effective leadership</strong></p><strong>Mindful leadership: A new way to sustain effective leadership</strong><p>To gain a deeper understanding of how meditation works, I have had the privilege of several interactions with the Dalai Lama and have developed a relationship with Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche, a leading Tibetan Buddhist meditation master. Both of them want to offer meditation to those in the West, not as a religious belief, but as a secular practice that can positively impact our lives and contribute to a more peaceful world.</p><p>While participating with the Dalai Lama at the Mind &amp; Life XX Conference on “Compassion and Altruism in Economic Systems” in Zurich this past April, Mingyur Rinpoche and I explored how we could combine the Buddhist notion of mindfulness meditation and authentic leadership to develop “mindful leaders.”</p><p><span style=\"color: #800000; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\"><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">“Mindful leadership aims to develop self-aware and compassionate leaders by combining Western understanding of authentic leadership with Eastern wisdom about the mind, developed thousands of years ago.”</strong></span></p><span><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">“Mindful leadership aims to develop self-aware and compassionate leaders by combining Western understanding of authentic leadership with Eastern wisdom about the mind, developed thousands of years ago.”</strong></span><strong>“Mindful leadership aims to develop self-aware and compassionate leaders by combining Western understanding of authentic leadership with Eastern wisdom about the mind, developed thousands of years ago.”</strong><p>Mindful leadership is a&nbsp;<em style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">secular</em>&nbsp;idea that enables people to sustain effective leadership throughout their lifetimes. It enables them to be fully present, aware of themselves and their impact on other people, and focused on achieving the goals of their organizations. Mindful leadership aims to develop self-aware and compassionate leaders by combining Western understanding of authentic leadership with Eastern wisdom about the mind, developed from practices that have been used for thousands of years.</p><em>secular</em><p>To engage in a deeper exploration of these ideas Mingyur Rinpoche and I jointly led the Mindful Leadership conference on August 13-14, 2010 in Minneapolis. The event brought together 400 participants to examine how mindfulness can contribute to sustaining effective leadership and to explore the relationship of self-awareness and self-compassion to leadership development. To our knowledge, this was the first time a Buddhist Rinpoche and a leadership professor joined forces to explore how Eastern teaching can inform Western thinking about leadership, and vice versa.</p><p><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">Gaining self-awareness and self-compassion</strong></p><strong>Gaining self-awareness and self-compassion</strong><p>For leaders to become self-aware, they need to understand their life stories and the impact of their crucibles, and reflect on how their life stories and crucibles contribute to their motivations and their behaviors. Leaders who do not take time for introspection and reflection on their life stories, crucibles and experiences are more vulnerable to being seduced by external rewards, such as power, money, and recognition. These leaders also may feel a need to appear so perfect to to others that they cannot admit vulnerabilities and acknowledge their mistakes.</p><p>In the process of becoming more self-aware, leaders learn to accept their weaknesses, failures, and vulnerabilities, just as they appreciate their strengths and successes. In so doing, they gain compassion for themselves and the ability to relate to the world around them in authentic ways. This frees them from the need to adopt pretenses to impress other people. In understanding themselves and who they are at a deeper level, people learn how to reframe their failures and negative experiences into positive growth opportunities.</p><p>Leaders with low EQ often lack compassion for themselves. Without self-compassion, it is difficult to feel compassion and empathy for others. Many people appear to be highly compassionate toward people they care about or who are close to them, but then express disdain, rejection and hostility for people whose beliefs and characteristics are different than their own. These leaders have a tendency to use or manipulate other people, particularly those with less perceived power. As a result, they are unable to establish authentic relationships that can be sustained over time.</p><p>Leaders that lack self-awareness also often lack the ability to self-regulate. Some leaders exhibit high levels of self-control and self-discipline in normal times. When they are under pressure or feel vulnerable, they revert to their worst traits, such as emotional outbursts or excessive use of power and control. Others move in the opposite direction, feeling immobilized or withdrawing just when their leadership is needed most.</p><p><span style=\"color: #800000; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\"><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">“Authentic leaders never let their organizations lose sight of a shared sense of purpose and common values.”</strong></span></p><span><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">“Authentic leaders never let their organizations lose sight of a shared sense of purpose and common values.”</strong></span><strong>“Authentic leaders never let their organizations lose sight of a shared sense of purpose and common values.”</strong><p>Leaders who develop self-awareness and self-compassion are better able to cope with high levels of stress and pressure. They maintain the capacity to empower people to perform at a very high level even under very difficult circumstances. Authentic leaders never let their organizations lose sight of a shared sense of purpose and common values. With the unity that results from this alignment and consistency, organizations are able to take on very challenging goals, overcome great difficulties and adverse circumstances, and achieve exceptional results on a sustainable basis.</p><p>The final step in gaining self-awareness requires going beyond the introspection and reflection that mindfulness meditation brings.&nbsp; True self-awareness—and mindful leadership—happens by gaining shared awareness through a personal support group. Having both practiced meditation and participated in a support group, I have personally experienced the highly beneficial impact that the combination of these two practices have had on my leadership effectiveness.</p><p>I am fortunate to have two such groups in my life. One of these groups consists of eight men who meet weekly to discuss the essential questions of life, as well as the challenges we are facing. The group was especially helpful to me when I was considering leaving Honeywell to join Medtronic back in 1989, and also when my wife Penny was diagnosed with breast cancer in 1996.&nbsp; The second group is a couples group, consisting of four couples, which meets monthly and engages in important questions that we are facing in our lives and our families.</p><p>These support groups provide a safe place for sharing our deepest concerns and most personal questions. They offer the vital link between our personal lives and introspective practices and the much larger organizations that all of us work in and live with every day. Their honest feedback provides a sense of shared awareness that deepens and enriches our self-awareness and helps us stay on track.</p><p><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">Concluding thoughts</strong></p><strong>Concluding thoughts</strong><p>Mindful leadership is an emerging idea in the early stages of development and validation. It offers the promise of using long-established practices from Eastern traditions like Buddhism in a secular manner to develop higher levels of self-awareness and self-compassion. In turn, the greater level of calm, clarity, and tranquility of mindful leaders will lead to more effective leadership and to developing more authentic organizations.</p><p><span style=\"color: #800000; padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\"><strong style=\"padding: 0px; margin: 0px;\">“Mindful leadership will help the new generation of authentic leaders to restore trust in their leadership and to build sustainable organizations known for their harmony.

Chief executives lack clarity about where the White House’s policies are headed and are deeply concerned they will have a long-term negative impact on the private sector. In addition, they feel their concerns are not being heard.</p><p>As a result, they are holding back on further investments in this country, preferring to shift resources to faster-growing emerging markets.</p><p>These are not just talking points of the business community looking for short-term profits.

Romer</a><p>In Obama 1.0, the president stabilized the economy with government spending that minimized job losses and personal bankruptcies. But the economy has stagnated as these policies have been ineffective in stimulating private sector growth, jobs and innovation. Relying on monetary policies and deficits to drive consumer spending is not working, because the economy is experiencing fundamental structural changes that are impervious to these macroeconomic approaches. That’s why there are 26 million people — 16.5 percent of the workforce — who would like to be working full time but are not.</p><p>Now is the time to introduce Obama 2.0 by initiating pro-growth economic policies that will invigorate job growth. This means&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/09/another-view-its-time-to-invest-in-america/\">investing in America</a>&nbsp;to unlock the $2 trillion currently in corporate coffers and to stimulate private-sector hiring. Mr. Obama also needs to make fundamental changes in relationships with the business community, overcoming the distrust that has developed on both sides.</p><a href=\"http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/09/another-view-its-time-to-invest-in-america/\">investing in America</a><p>The president’s Labor Day proposals were encouraging. He offered a 100 percent deduction for capital investment until the end of 2011, an increase in research and development tax credits that would make them permanent, and an additional $50 billion in infrastructure spending. All three initiatives suggest Mr. Obama is finally moving away from trying to cure the economy’s ills with deficit-fueled government spending and beginning to enact policies that foster private-sector investment and job creation.</p><p>It is none too soon. A new economic direction will give the Obama presidency a much-needed shot in the arm at a time when the Democrats are in danger of losing a significant number of seats in Congress and quite possibly control of the House of Representatives.</p><p>The situation is similar to President&nbsp;<a title=\"More articles about Bill Clinton.\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/bill_clinton/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Bill Clinton</a>’s problem after the 1994 elections swept Republicans into House leadership.

There is still no one in his cabinet or in the higher levels of his White House staff who has ever worked in the private sector.

      "<p>Returning to Minnesota after 10 days in Germany and Austria, my wife Penny and I were struck by just how much time we spend in America focusing on issues that are largely out of our control.</p><p>High visibility issues discussed endlessly on television — a New Jersey student’s suicide, primary election results in Delaware, Islamic cultural center near Ground Zero, burning the Koran in Florida, marital infidelity in California, Glenn Beck’s rally in D.C., gay marriage, the Tea Party — may trigger inflamed emotions, but there is little we can do to change them.</p><p>It’s easy to get caught up in contemporary national topics that arouse our sense of injustice and right and wrong. I often find myself doing so on issues of religious intolerance and discrimination based on race, gender, and sexual preference.</p><p>So why do we spend so much energy on them? We should work to change those things that are important to us whenever we can, but we seem to be wasting too much time on issues we cannot impact.</p><p>At times like these, I return to Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr’s famous serenity prayer, which has been widely adopted by Alcoholics Anonymous:</p><p>“God, grant me the serenity</p><p>To accept the things I cannot change;</p><p>Courage to change the things I can;</p><p>And wisdom to know the difference.”</p><p>It’s time to focus on issues here at home, where we can change things, and our efforts really make a difference.</p><p>In August, I wrote about a truly authentic leader, <a href=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/articles/win-wallin-an-authentic-leader-in-our-midst1/\">Win&nbsp;Wallin,</a> and the remarkable impact&nbsp;Wallin&nbsp;Education Scholars is having in funding scholarships for local high school graduates who lack the financial resources to continue their education.

These days Joe heads up the 1 Percent Club, where he has convinced hundreds of Minnesotans to commit to giving 1 percent of their net worth to philanthropic causes.</p><strong>Joe&nbsp;Selvaggio</strong><p><strong>Adrienne&nbsp;Diercks</strong>: In 1994 Adrienne founded Project Success, which provides creative and motivational programs for junior high and high school students. Her remarkably successful programs have prepared 10,000 teenagers for solid careers by giving them pride in themselves and teaching them to use their creative skills.</p><strong>Adrienne&nbsp;Diercks</strong><p><strong>Steve Rothschild</strong>: Giving up a highly successful career as executive vice president of General Mills, Steve turned his enormous energy and tenacity to the 1994 founding of Twin Cities RISE! TCR helps people of color, many of them ex-convicts, get trained for sustainable jobs that pay living wages. Steve and his team learned that people needed self-esteem even more than skills, so they transformed their training to help people feel empowered first. Steve applied business principles like “return on investment” to demonstrate that TCR’s programs were economically viable and thus worthy of private-sector investment. These days TCR is a national model for job training.</p><strong>Steve Rothschild</strong><p><strong>Mary Jo&nbsp;Kreitzer</strong>: The long-time leader of the University of Minnesota’s Center for Spirituality and Healing, Mary Jo has been a pioneer in the burgeoning field of integrative medicine, blending spirituality into the healing process. She co-chaired the Coalition of Academic Health Centers for Integrative Medicine. Recently, she convinced the University of Minnesota to create a doctorate in nursing in integrative medicine to train future leaders in the field. Next spring, she is hosting a two-day series of lectures and symposia with the Dalai Lama&nbsp; on meditation in healing.</p><strong>Mary Jo&nbsp;Kreitzer</strong><p><strong>Jim&nbsp;Gertmenian</strong>: As senior minister at Plymouth Congregational Church, Jim has taken on the immense problems of the homeless in Minneapolis. To understand their plight, Jim regularly sleeps in shelters, talking to homeless men and women, and he organizes youth groups to experience homelessness for a night. He helped create Lydia House as a transition site for the homeless until they can get into permanent housing. Most recently, he launched the Curry Avenue Partnership, in the shadow of the Target Stadium, an area where many homeless people reside. He convinced dozens of corporations and foundations to contribute $350,000 to funding counselors for the homeless to help them find sustainable jobs.</p><strong>Jim&nbsp;Gertmenian</strong><p><strong>Tim Kenny</strong>: As director of education for the Minnesota Landscape Arboretum, Tim recognized that inner-city youth didn’t have transportation to come to the arboretum in Chaska, so he decided to take it to their neighborhoods. Tim organized urban gardening projects in three sites in the Phillips neighborhood. There inner-city youth are growing vegetables and flowers and learning about nature and plants, while beautifying their neighborhood. These sites are run by graduates of the program, who are so committed to its goals that they are building careers there.</p><strong>Tim Kenny</strong><p><strong>Jim Campbell</strong>: The former CEO of Wells Fargo Minnesota, Jim never let up in his decade-long challenge to get an authentic outdoor baseball stadium in Minneapolis and keep the Twins here at home. He tirelessly lobbied corporate leaders, government officials and the&nbsp;Pohlad&nbsp;family to find a way to fund it. Thanks to his efforts and those of many other local leaders, Target Field is the finest baseball park in the nation. It is sold out every game, as thousands of Minnesotans arrive on light-rail trains, whose main terminal is at the stadium. Equally important, it is providing new life to downtown Minneapolis.</p><strong>Jim Campbell</strong><p><strong>Marilyn Carlson Nelson and Ken Powell</strong>: She is chairwoman and CEO of Carlson Companies. He is General Mills’ chairman and CEO. They led the jobs task force of the Itasca Project to develop a strategy to create sustainable private-sector jobs in Minnesota. Their widely-acclaimed report won plaudits and support from politicians and corporate leaders alike and is moving aggressively into the implementation phase.</p><strong>Marilyn Carlson Nelson and Ken Powell</strong><p>These are just a handful of the thousands of Minnesotans who are devoting their efforts to make Minnesota a great place to live and work. If the rest of us would devote our prodigious time and energy to tackling local problems instead of endlessly debating things we cannot change, Minnesota would be an even brighter beacon for the rest of America.</p>"

His opponents have relentlessly attacked every legislative victory he has achieved as being “bad for business”—from his health plan to the automotive bail-out, the $853 billion stimulus bill and financial reform.</p><p>One senior congressional Republican called the president’s agenda “job-killing”. Another said he “was like a teenager with a credit card” when it came to federal spending. Ironically, cries that the administration is bad for business often come from the beneficiaries of Mr Obama’s bold moves to stabilise the collapsing economy he inherited.</p><p>To demonstrate that these criticisms are patently unfair, take an objective look at his record.</p><p>When he took office on January 21st 2009, Mr Obama inherited an economic disaster from his predecessor. Bank credit had virtually shut down, housing markets and prices were collapsing, and American automobile companies were struggling for survival. Millions of Americans were losing their homes and their jobs as massive lay-offs accelerated.</p><p>Mr Obama moved courageously to contain this mounting disaster, demonstrating the principled leadership required to restore the nation’s economic strength. Had he not moved so quickly to halt the tailspin, America would have experienced far greater economic calamity. His stimulus package, passed by Congress in only two months, kept millions of Americans from losing their jobs and put many more back to work. He extended the safety net to protect the unemployed from further harm. The Recovery Act has been highly successful, yielding $3 in private investment for every $1 of public spending.</p><p>In March 2009, Mr Obama faced the bankruptcies of General Motors and Chrysler, as millions of manufacturing jobs were at risk of disappearing. He made some of his finest moves in restructuring their ownership and appointing new management to restore two of America’s great institutions. His actions, including short-term relief with “cash for clunkers”, helped all three American automobile manufacturers get back to profitability.</p><p>The president has been most aggressively attacked by Republicans for his courage in reforming health care and financial services. His health-care package addressed long-standing, intractable problems such as ever-increasing health-care costs and 45m Americans without health insurance. The legislation provides long-run solutions, providing coverage for 35m more Americans and bending the cost curve downward.</p><p>Financial services reform was essential to restore trust in the financial community and avoid a repeat of the 2008 global financial meltdown that created the economic problems. The legislation reduces excess leverage among financial institutions that led many to the brink of bankruptcy, and clarifies the rules so that all financial services organisations compete on a level playing field.</p><p>In contrast to Mr Obama’s diligent efforts to solve these long-standing problems, his critics’ arguments against them are short-sighted. By mandating coverage for all employees, he has reinforced the American system of employee health care and vastly reduced free care and inappropriate treatment. The commitment in the legislation to prevention, wellness and efficiency improvements will ultimately bring health-care costs under control, thereby enabling business to be more competitive in global markets.</p><p>America’s greatest challenge is the structural change in the economy that left 14m people unemployed. Without the administration’s efforts, the situation would have been much worse with millions more out of work. America lost 216,000 jobs per month in 2008, while this past year it has gained 84,000 per month, excluding census hiring. The Small Business Jobs and Credit Act restores job growth in small businesses by creating a $30 billion fund that will leverage $300 billion in lending. It also provides 100% depreciation for capital investments. An estimated 500,000 jobs will be added as a result of this legislation.</p><p>As the economy has stabilised, Mr Obama has initiated multiple policies aimed at reigniting free-market growth. To spur business investment and unleash pent-up capital spending, companies can earn 100% tax write-offs up to the end of 2011, further spurring private-sector job creation. To stimulate innovation—America’s competitive edge—research and development tax credits will be increased and made permanent. The new products and ideas unleashed by these tax credits will create new jobs for years to come. The administration will also invest an additional $50 billion in government-funded infrastructure projects.</p><p>In his first two years Mr Obama had to deal with a highly recalcitrant Congress, with Republicans trying to block and undermine every initiative, and with Democrats trying to shift to a larger public sector with a heavily regulated private sector. Navigating that chasm has not been easy, but he has done it extremely skilfully.</p><p>This objective examination of Mr Obama’s efforts to rebuild the economy can only lead to the conclusion that he has been very good indeed for business.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/584#con_statement_anchor\"><strong>Nichole Gelinas Opening Statement&nbsp;</strong></a></p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/584#con_statement_anchor\"><strong>Nichole Gelinas Opening Statement&nbsp;</strong></a><strong>Nichole Gelinas Opening Statement&nbsp;</strong><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/585#mod_module\"> </a></strong></p><strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/585#mod_module\"> </a></strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/585#mod_module\"> </a><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/585#mod_module\"></a></strong></p><strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/585#mod_module\"></a></strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/585#mod_module\"></a><strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/585#mod_module\">\n<hr>\n</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/585#mod_module\">\n<hr>\n</a><hr><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/585#mod_module\">Moderator’s Rebuttal Remarks</a></strong></p><strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/585#mod_module\">Moderator’s Rebuttal Remarks</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/585#mod_module\">Moderator’s Rebuttal Remarks</a><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Rebuttal:&nbsp;</h3><div>\n<p>Nicole Gelinas argues that “the most dangerous thing that he [Mr Obama] has done is to try to preserve a failed status quo at the expense of a healthy recovery” and thus failed to create a “safe and predictable environment for investment capital”. She does not make a logical case for her argument, nor does she offer reasonable alternatives.</p>\n<p>President Obama’s actions were certainly not aimed at preserving the status quo. To the contrary, he acted swiftly to prevent complete collapse in housing, financial services, automobiles, health care, and state and local government. Her argument that permitting further disintegration in these vital sectors would yield an economic rebound and more predictable environment is neither reasonable nor rational.</p>\n<p>Had the Obama administration not taken swift action on all fronts, confidence in the American economy would have collapsed, and today we would be in the second Great Depression. Letting all weak institutions fail, as she implies, would have led to precisely the “unpredictable chaos” that Ms Gelinas now fears.</p>\n<p>Let’s look at the facts in each case:</p>\n<p><strong>Housing.</strong>&nbsp;Had Mr Obama not moved quickly to stabilise mortgage and housing markets, millions of people would have been forced out of their homes; for many, this would have meant declaring personal bankruptcy. It also would have led to a deeper collapse in housing sales and construction with many more jobs lost.</p>\n<p>Working with the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates low and make liquidity available was an integral part of Mr Obama’s solution, not the problem that Ms Gelinas asserts. Since there is plenty of liquidity available in the system, her argument that housing investments squeeze out other investments is illogical. Nor is it reasonable for her to assert that business is buying “too dearly”; to the contrary, private-sector capital investment is far too low and needs to be stimulated.</p>\n<p><strong>Financial services reform.</strong>&nbsp;Dodd-Frank was required to restore trust in financial institutions. I disagree completely with Ms Gelinas that it exacerbates “too big to fail”. I do not know of a single financial institution that thinks this administration would step in and save it.</p>\n<p>However, new authority granted to the treasury and the Federal Reserve was essential to prevent future meltdowns; this authority would have prevented Lehman Brothers’ bankruptcy, which triggered the 2008 meltdown. Her argument that granting discretion to top-level government officials is wrong does not hold water either. The alternative is endless regulations that constrain American financial institutions from funding private-sector growth and competing in global markets.</p>\n<p>I agree that solutions are needed for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. However, Mr Obama was correct in putting financial-services reform first. Now he can turn his attention to focus on solutions for these federal institutions.</p>\n<p><strong>State and local government.</strong>&nbsp;Mr Obama’s $858 billion stimulus package included $217 billion for state and local governments. Had he not done so, millions of police and fire personnel, teachers, nurses and other public-sector employees would have lost their jobs. Schools, public hospitals, public safety and other vital services would have been shut down. Granted, states were overspending when Mr Obama took office, but that is no excuse for triggering the economic collapse of state and local governments.</p>\n<p>Ms Gelinas’s proposal to cut state and local education funding is the most disturbing idea she presented. We desperately need better-educated workers to compete in a globalised world.</p>\n<p><strong>Infrastructure.</strong>&nbsp;Ms Gelinas is incorrect in arguing that Mr Obama did not fund infrastructure. The stimulus bill included $44 billion allotted for the Department of Transportation alone, which is being supplemented by an additional $50 billion dedicated to funding infrastructure.</p>\n<p><strong>Tax policy.</strong>&nbsp;The country cannot continue with enormous deficits triggered by the Bush administration’s tax cuts. Setting a 20% limit on capital gains and dividends, as treasury secretary Timothy Geithner has proposed, is quite reasonable. Investment will not be hampered any more than it was under the Clinton administration when the capital gains and dividend rate was at the same level that Mr Geithner has proposed. It is essential to restore the balance between tax receipts and government spending in order to build a solid economy with sustainable growth.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Rather than preserving the status quo, as Ms Gelinas asserts, Mr Obama’s aggressive actions have restored confidence in the American economy and provided a pathway for long-term economic growth. They have addressed long-standing problems such as health care, American competitiveness in automobiles and a declining infrastructure.</p>\n<p>Mr Obama’s leadership prevented the total economic calamity we were heading for in 2008 and created a safer and more predictable environment for investment capital. Banks are lending again, jobs are increasing—albeit too slowly—and Mr Obama’s recent initiatives will accelerate private-sector investment and job creation. His efforts have created a sustainable financial future for all Americans, a vastly stronger business climate and steady increases in jobs.</p>\n<p>Instead of constantly attacking Mr Obama’s actions, it is time to unite behind them to create sustainable growth and restore American competitiveness in global markets.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/585#con_statement_anchor\"><strong>Nicole Gelinas Rebuttal&nbsp;</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/590#mod_module\"> </a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/590#mod_module\"></a></strong></p><strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/590#mod_module\">\n<hr>\n</a></strong><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/590#mod_module\">Moderators Closing Remarks</a></strong></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h3>Closing Statement:&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>President Obama has approached his first term in two phases, both of which are good for business.</p>\n<p>Phase I aimed to stabilise the economy and prevent businesses and entire industries from collapsing in the wake of the great recession Mr Obama inherited. That phase has been completed successfully. Had he taken the laissez-faire approach recommended by Nicole Gelinas, America would have faced another Great Depression, from which it would have taken many years to recover with great harm to business as well as individuals.</p>\n<p>In Phase II, Mr Obama is focusing on building an economy of sustainable private-sector growth that creates millions of jobs, is innovative and technologically advanced, expands exports, and generates sufficient income to reduce the deficits of the past decade.</p>\n<p>In Phase I, the president immediately addressed the crisis he inherited from his predecessor, George W. Bush. He implemented a series of short-term actions designed to prevent a total collapse of the American economy and restore it to a stable footing. He also tackled longer-term problems, such as health care, financial services reform, industrial competitiveness, eroding infrastructure, energy policy, and technology and innovation.</p>\n<p>More than $100 billion of the stimulus package funded innovation and technology projects, such as renewable energy research, health care and transport, all of which will be crucial drivers of future growth. Mr Obama restored American automobile producers to health so they can focus on creating more innovative, fuel-efficient vehicles. The health-care bill contains billions of dollars for improved health and wellness and innovations in health-care delivery, which will lead to lower costs.</p>\n<p>Contrary to Ms Gelinas’s opinions, Mr Obama did not bail out Wall Street; those actions were taken by Mr Bush. Working with the Federal Reserve, he stabilised business and financial markets by providing sufficient liquidity and low interest rates to restore lending and prevent further collapse in housing markets, while enabling financial institutions to become healthy and profitable once again.</p>\n<p>This resulted in commercial banks repaying all their TARP funds plus a 14% return. Now Mr Obama is working with General Motors, Chrysler and AIG to repay their government loans as they too become profitable. These actions led to a 22% increase in the stockmarket in 2009, reflecting increased corporate profitability and renewed confidence in business.</p>\n<p>To get the economy back on its feet, Mr Obama correctly prioritised passage of the $853 billion stimulus bill, which created and saved millions of jobs. From that early legislative experience, he recognised that Republicans would oppose every initiative. Consequently, he moved quickly to reform health care and financial services while he had large congressional majorities, working with business leaders to gain their input and support.</p>\n<p>He recognised that the 2008 meltdown had destroyed trust in business and created an enormous gulf between Wall Street and Main Street. This required new rules and sounder oversight of financial institutions, leading to the passage of the Dodd-Frank bill. Mr Obama knew that major changes like these would incur opposition, but he was committed to solving these intractable problems, even at the expense of his popularity.</p>\n<p>In recent weeks, he has demonstrated that he will use the next two years to create sustainable growth in the economy, expand exports, create jobs and reduce the deficits begun by his predecessor. In this second phase, he is replacing his entire economics team, which successfully stabilised the economy, with a new team that can create sustainable growth. Shortly he will appoint a CEO known for integrity, innovation and growth as his chief economic adviser. He also appointed a new budget chief, charged with cutting excess federal spending to reduce the deficit.</p>\n<p>His Labor Day announcement to provide 100% depreciation on capital equipment purchases through 2011, increase R&amp;D tax credits and make them permanent, and spend an additional $50 billion on infrastructure are aimed at helping businesses compete, innovate and create sustainable jobs. His new export council, chaired by the CEOs of Boeing and Xerox, will stimulate American manufacturing and reduce unfavourable trade balances.</p>\n<p>In addition, he was successful in getting the Small Business bill passed by Congress, providing loans and jobs in this vital sector. Meanwhile, he continues to keep interest rates low and provide sufficient liquidity to support this expansion, while working with the Chinese to revalue their currency. These actions will increase America’s competitiveness and create millions of jobs while reducing unemployment rates.</p>\n<p>In his first two years Mr Obama has demonstrated extraordinary leadership in making tough choices and taking swift action to restore confidence. These actions have been good for business, both long-term and short-term. By the end of his term, the business community and the American public will recognise just how effective he has been in stabilising the economy and restoring America’s growth and competitiveness.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/586#con_statement_anchor\"><strong>Nicole Gelinas Closing Statement&nbsp;</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/587\">Winner Announcement</a></strong></p>\n</div><p>Nicole Gelinas argues that “the most dangerous thing that he [Mr Obama] has done is to try to preserve a failed status quo at the expense of a healthy recovery” and thus failed to create a “safe and predictable environment for investment capital”.

The health-care bill contains billions of dollars for improved health and wellness and innovations in health-care delivery, which will lead to lower costs.</p><p>Contrary to Ms Gelinas’s opinions, Mr Obama did not bail out Wall Street; those actions were taken by Mr Bush. Working with the Federal Reserve, he stabilised business and financial markets by providing sufficient liquidity and low interest rates to restore lending and prevent further collapse in housing markets, while enabling financial institutions to become healthy and profitable once again.</p><p>This resulted in commercial banks repaying all their TARP funds plus a 14% return. Now Mr Obama is working with General Motors, Chrysler and AIG to repay their government loans as they too become profitable. These actions led to a 22% increase in the stockmarket in 2009, reflecting increased corporate profitability and renewed confidence in business.</p><p>To get the economy back on its feet, Mr Obama correctly prioritised passage of the $853 billion stimulus bill, which created and saved millions of jobs. From that early legislative experience, he recognised that Republicans would oppose every initiative. Consequently, he moved quickly to reform health care and financial services while he had large congressional majorities, working with business leaders to gain their input and support.</p><p>He recognised that the 2008 meltdown had destroyed trust in business and created an enormous gulf between Wall Street and Main Street. This required new rules and sounder oversight of financial institutions, leading to the passage of the Dodd-Frank bill. Mr Obama knew that major changes like these would incur opposition, but he was committed to solving these intractable problems, even at the expense of his popularity.</p><p>In recent weeks, he has demonstrated that he will use the next two years to create sustainable growth in the economy, expand exports, create jobs and reduce the deficits begun by his predecessor. In this second phase, he is replacing his entire economics team, which successfully stabilised the economy, with a new team that can create sustainable growth. Shortly he will appoint a CEO known for integrity, innovation and growth as his chief economic adviser. He also appointed a new budget chief, charged with cutting excess federal spending to reduce the deficit.</p><p>His Labor Day announcement to provide 100% depreciation on capital equipment purchases through 2011, increase R&amp;D tax credits and make them permanent, and spend an additional $50 billion on infrastructure are aimed at helping businesses compete, innovate and create sustainable jobs. His new export council, chaired by the CEOs of Boeing and Xerox, will stimulate American manufacturing and reduce unfavourable trade balances.</p><p>In addition, he was successful in getting the Small Business bill passed by Congress, providing loans and jobs in this vital sector. Meanwhile, he continues to keep interest rates low and provide sufficient liquidity to support this expansion, while working with the Chinese to revalue their currency. These actions will increase America’s competitiveness and create millions of jobs while reducing unemployment rates.</p><p>In his first two years Mr Obama has demonstrated extraordinary leadership in making tough choices and taking swift action to restore confidence. These actions have been good for business, both long-term and short-term. By the end of his term, the business community and the American public will recognise just how effective he has been in stabilising the economy and restoring America’s growth and competitiveness.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/586#con_statement_anchor\"><strong>Nicole Gelinas Closing Statement&nbsp;</strong></a></p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/586#con_statement_anchor\"><strong>Nicole Gelinas Closing Statement&nbsp;</strong></a><strong>Nicole Gelinas Closing Statement&nbsp;</strong><p><strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/587\">Winner Announcement</a></strong></p><strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/587\">Winner Announcement</a></strong><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/debate/days/view/587\">Winner Announcement</a>"

      "<p>Times of great upheaval sow the seeds of great leadership.</p><p>The war for American independence was filled with uncertainty and tumult.&nbsp; George Washington, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson emerged to form a nation and set a new course. The Civil War split the fledgling country in two.&nbsp; Abraham Lincoln helped stitch us back together as the likes of Carnegie and Rockefeller then put the country to work.</p><p>The Great Depression and Second World War left the world in uncertain hands.&nbsp; Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman brought clarity of purpose to the political helm and IBM’s Thomas J. Watson wrote the playbook on ethical, sustainable growth.</p><p>The recession of the early 1980’s put Americans on their heels as businesses stagnated, weighed down with their own bureaucracies. Jack Welch taught a new generation of managers to be internally efficient and externally competitive, as Bill Gates and Michael Dell led a new generation of entrepreneurs.</p><p>The dot-com bubble had us star struck–the burst turned us cynical.&nbsp; Then Enron imploded, along with hundreds of other companies that admitted to inappropriate accounting. As we picked up the economic pieces, Google’s Sergey Brin and Larry Page and Apple’s Steve Jobs redefined customer-centric technology in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Once again America became excited about business and its future.</p><sup>st</sup><p><strong>The Root Cause of All These Ups and Downs</strong></p><strong>The Root Cause of All These Ups and Downs</strong><p>Just a few years later we’re back in the mire. America is still recovering from the most significant financial meltdown in eighty years, a jobs crisis that has left 26 million Americans searching for full-time jobs, massive federal deficits, and the greatest environmental disaster in the nation’s history.</p><p>What’s the root cause of all these up and downs? In a word, <em>leadership</em>.</p><em>leadership</em><p>More precisely, the downturns have resulted from leaders who focused on the short-term and put their self-interests ahead of the institutions they were chosen to lead. The successes have resulted from visionary leaders with a passion to change the world for the better by building enduring organizations.</p><p>America is in dire need of a leadership rebirth. As the result of the well-known failures of many “baby boomer” leaders that got caught playing the short-term game, the time has come for a new generation to step up and lead our corporations and institutions. Personally, I am encouraged that the new heads of major corporations – from IBM, Ford and General Motors to PepsiCo, Xerox, Unilever, and many others – are values-centered leaders focused on building sustainable organizations that serve society.</p><p><strong>Rejection of the “Command and Control” Leader</strong></p><strong>Rejection of the “Command and Control” Leader</strong><p>These leaders have rejected the “command-and-control” style of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. They understand their success is dependent on developing capable, authentic leaders throughout their organizations – leaders aligned with the company’s mission and values, who can empower other leaders, and are effective in collaborating inside the organization and externally as well.</p><sup>th</sup><p>For this reason they are focusing more of their time on developing rising leaders than on developing their stock prices. It takes time and patience to develop future leaders who can be successful in a wide range of highly stressful situations while retaining their purpose and character. More importantly, it requires the personal engagement of top leaders with the rising stars, both to mentor them and to learn from them.</p><p>Pepsi’s Indra Nooyi is a beacon of this philosophy, steering the soft drink giant toward healthier food options, focusing the Pepsi Foundation on a campaign to overcome obesity, and experimenting in philanthropy-marketing via the Pepsi REFRESH program.&nbsp; She focuses time and energy in developing leaders for the future that can help her grow a sustainable enterprise that will positively impact the communities Pepsi serves.&nbsp;</p><p>We need leaders with the humility to share success and accept responsibility for failure.&nbsp; After watching so many top leaders pass the buck and deny their responsibilities, the next generation of leaders needs to develop a deep humility and a keen sense of their responsibilities.</p><p><strong>Among the Leaders Stepping Forward….</strong></p><strong>Among the Leaders Stepping Forward….</strong><p>Among the generation of younger leaders stepping forward, Tony Hsieh, CEO of Zappos, stands out.&nbsp; An entrepreneur who cut his teeth in the dotcom era, Hsieh is redefining customer-centric leadership, creating a team at Zappos whose sole mission is customer service. Hsieh holds his employees – and himself – accountable to the first company value: “Deliver Wow through service.” He notes, “We’ve formalized the definition of our culture into 10 core values. Basically what we’re looking for are peoples whose personal values match our corporate values, who naturally live the brand.”</p><p>Under Armour’s CEO, Kevin Plank, is another example of the best of the younger generation.&nbsp; When his company underperformed in early 2008, Plank cut his own salary from $500,000 to $26,000, owning the misstep and apologizing to his team.&nbsp; A year later, Under Armour is generating record revenues and is the fastest growing sports apparel company in the world, but Plank credits his teammates rather than himself.&nbsp;</p><p>For tomorrow’s leaders to propel us to a more vibrant future, today’s business leaders need to get personally involved in mentoring future leaders and in guiding their development. &nbsp;But most of all, they need to create opportunities for emerging leaders to gain experience on the firing line. That’s something you can’t get in a staff role preparing power point charts or in searching for merger deals.</p><p>Unfortunately, many young leaders, having succeeded at everything they have done, fear that failure in a line role might kill their careers. Actually, that’s not true. It is only through mistakes and failures that young leaders can understand their shortcomings and focus on the hard work of developing their leadership abilities</p><p>There is only so much that can be learned in a classroom, or even the conference room.&nbsp; The next generation needs dirt-under-the-fingernails experience.&nbsp; And they will only get it if the current leadership thrusts them into it.&nbsp;</p><p>I faced my first business crisis when I was only 27 years old, thanks to a boss who had the courage to bet on me. Working for Litton Industries, I was sent to Minneapolis as assistant general manager for Litton’s fledgling microwave oven division. At the time, along with several competitors, Litton was trying to create the U.S. market for consumer microwave ovens.</p><p>The night before, as I was packing my bags, I heard the radio announcer say, “The Surgeon General of the United States has just declared that microwave ovens may be hazardous for your health.” The next morning I found the small division in chaos and its leadership paralyzed like a deer in the headlights. The FDA was proposing new safety standards that no one was certain the new designs could meet. Meanwhile, the first two thousand ovens had already been shipped to customers.</p><p>Not being an expert in the business or the technology, nevertheless I instinctively jumped in the leadership void and got everyone organized to address the issues. It was also clear we needed a more experienced executive team, so I set out to recruit them. Meanwhile, the corporate executive vice president arrived and immediately ordered that we recall all the ovens we had shipped, in spite of my protestations that they were safe. His arbitrary decision may not have had any analytical basis, but intuitively he knew we were in trouble.</p><p>That forced us to redesign our products for the tightest of safety standards while our production crews stood idle. Many nights I went into the factory around 4:00 AM to see if we could restart production when the assembly workers arrived – and often we couldn’t.</p><p>At the same time I learned a great deal about dealing in the public eye as the deluge of negative media stories about unsafe radiation was overwhelming. Step-by-step we had to dig ourselves out of a hole, but eventually we built a viable market and became its leader. While I made many mistakes through my “baptism by fire,” I learned a great deal about leading through crisis – lessons that were invaluable in facing the much greater challenges of running Medtronic.</p><p>Today’s young leaders will soon find themselves in similar situations, if senior leaders give them opportunities to learn on the firing line, as the military does with young officers. That’s the only way they can learn about themselves and their leadership so they are prepared for the greater challenges that lie ahead.</p><p><strong>Leading in a Sustainable, Authentic Way </strong></p><strong>Leading in a Sustainable, Authentic Way </strong><p>Tomorrow’s leaders find themselves at a similar inflection point: America needs them to lead now in a more sustainable, authentic way than many of their predecessors have done.&nbsp; We need entrepreneurs to grow businesses and create jobs.&nbsp; We need 21<sup>st</sup> century leaders who will collaborate across organization lines to solve society’s most intractable problems in a global world.</p><sup>st</sup><p>That’s a tall order, but I am confident that the new generation of leaders is ready to step up to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Originally Printed in the Fall Edition of MWorld</em></p><em>Originally Printed in the Fall Edition of MWorld</em>"

Did the “twentysomethings” who sat in those theaters grow up into the fortysomethings who helped create the subprime mortgage financing bubble that ultimately decimated much of the hard-earned net-worths of so many homeowners and investors?</p><p>If it did, then we should be wary because on Friday the movie sequel to Wall Street will be released, in which the lead villain, Gordon Gecko, completes his prison term and resumes his life, chastened, rehabilitated — or not. If the first movie could be used as a “teachable moment,” how should we view the sequel?</p><p>Have things changed on Wall Street since the original exposé of insider trading? Or have the players and the vehicles changed but the negative drivers still rule? Do power and wealth automatically corrupt?</p><p>I think not. We only have to look at some outstanding examples of wealthy, powerful individuals who have used their resources to create so much good to know that power and wealth alone are not enough to turn good people bad. Look no further than Warren Buffet and Bill Gates to see that much good can come from legitimately earned wealth. We also need to note that, by and large, the investment community comprises sincere, highly competent professionals who have their clients’ best interests clearly in focus.</p><p>However, Bernie Madoff, Tom Petters, Trevor Cook and others in the media recently have shown that power and wealth, combined with weak character, can indeed corrupt. Are there elements that distinguish those who persevere and succeed from those who succumb and fail so spectacularly?</p><p>Remaining on the path</p><p>I think there are, and I believe that countless fine business schools will use these two movies in the coming weeks to illustrate the temptations so visible in each and then to instill the antidotes to preclude the temptations from taking control of individual values and behaviors.</p><p>The key can be as simple as the advice offered by George Buckley, CEO of 3M Co., in his commencement address to University of St. Thomas graduate business students this past May.</p><p>“As crimes or slips in standards occur for us as individuals, the next slip becomes just that bit easier. Pretty soon the successive slips become routine. … Don’t take that first small step,” Buckley said.</p><p>Or it can be an old-fashioned “teach-in,” such as what we at St. Thomas plan to do for several hundred graduate and undergraduate business students at a private screening of the Wall Street sequel this week.</p><p>We will have senior university ethicists and local corporate leaders preview the movie and describe key moments to note and resources to use when one finds oneself in ethically compromising circumstances.</p><p>Learning when and how to draw upon one’s core values to overcome the siren song of greed will help guide our future business and investment leaders to emulate the Warren Buffets, Bill Gateses, Bill Georges and Chuck Dennys of the world and use their knowledge and skills to create and deliver superior value while earning a just profit and making our world better.</p><p>So, the bottom line is that greed is never good. Talent, integrity and wisdom will always come out ahead in the long run, and the role of good business schools everywhere is to ensure that these values take precedence over the shady deals that in fact are too good to be true.</p>"

Multimillion-dollar bonuses at American International Group (<a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=AIG\">AIG</a>) and Merrill Lynch (<a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=BAC\">BAC</a>) certainly didn’t help. Two consecutive years of declining CEO pay, on the other hand, haven’t either.</p><a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=AIG\">AIG</a><a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=BAC\">BAC</a><p>As a result, politicians are lining up to give shareholders greater control over executive pay. On the surface these changes sound like shareholder democracy, which would be a good thing. But rather than solving problems with executive compensation, they may result in myriad unintended consequences.</p><p>Case in point: The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act grants shareholders advisory votes on compensation, allows activist shareholders with only 3 percent ownership to nominate board members, and prohibits voting by retail brokers representing small shareholders. These changes are likely to empower short-term money movers such as hedge funds at the expense of long-term owners—and pressure management to focus on the short term, which is the exact opposite of what’s needed.</p><p>In another example of good intentions not adequately thought through,&nbsp;<cite style=\"border-bottom-width: 1px; border-bottom-style: dashed; border-bottom-color: blue;\">The New York Times</cite>&nbsp;called on the Securities and Exchange Commission to publish ratios of CEO pay to “typical employees,” ignoring variations between industries. What about businesses focused on low-wage emerging markets? What about differences between high-wage software developers and low-wage service companies?</p><cite>The New York Times</cite><p>Imposed formulas for executive compensation simply won’t work at many companies. And we’ve seen how powerful the temptation can be for executives to manipulate short-term results to increase their compensation.</p><p>The regulations that will spring from Dodd-Frank are still being written. In the meantime, rather than just responding to pressures, boards and CEOs have a shot at restoring the confidence of the public by crafting responsible compensation policies unique to their needs. Doing this now will give U.S. companies an edge in fending off investors who are in it for the quick kill. It will also raise their odds of holding on to the top talent whose pay is the target of all this debate and ire.</p><p>Here are six policies that should be rigorously followed, including in bad times when boards are more prone to bend the rules for those in their top ranks:</p><p><em>1. Provide full transparency for compensation policies and actual practices.</em>&nbsp;Principles and pay policies should be consistent over time. Novartis (<a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=NVS\">NVS</a>) has been the forerunner in Europe by making its compensation practices fully transparent.</p><em>1. Provide full transparency for compensation policies and actual practices.</em><a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=NVS\">NVS</a><p><em>2. Create policies that reward long-term performance with long-term pay.</em>&nbsp;ExxonMobil (<a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=XOM\">XOM</a>) withholds more than two-thirds of its officers’ compensation until they retire or for 10 years, whichever is greater. This focuses executives on long-term results and provides for sound succession.</p><em>2. Create policies that reward long-term performance with long-term pay.</em><a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=XOM\">XOM</a><p><em>3. Reward executives for their performance, not the company’s stock price.</em>&nbsp;Target (<a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=TGT\">TGT</a>), for example, compensates its executives based on same-store sales performance relative to its peers.</p><em>3. Reward executives for their performance, not the company’s stock price.</em><a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=TGT\">TGT</a><p><em>4. Lengthen the time horizon for bonuses.</em>&nbsp;Companies should withhold significant amounts of compensation using restricted stock, with forfeiture for accounting adjustments and leaving the company. In 2009 the top 30 officers of Goldman Sachs (<a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=GS\">GS</a>) received no cash, getting bonuses in restricted stock with three-to-five-year vesting periods instead.</p><em>4. Lengthen the time horizon for bonuses.</em><a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=GS\">GS</a><p><em>5. Avoid formulaic approaches.</em>&nbsp;Compensation tied only to short-term metrics leads to long-term problems. Companies should include qualitative performance measures like strategy implementation, research milestones, and leadership development. To make its shift to “leading by values” relevant, IBM (<a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=IBM\">IBM</a>) includes bonus opportunities for furthering its values, especially in global collaboration.</p><em>5. Avoid formulaic approaches.</em><a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=IBM\">IBM</a><p><em>6. Boost equity between workers and executives.</em>&nbsp;People with greater responsibilities should receive greater compensation, but one way to signal that everyone matters is to drop special plans, benefits, and perks for executives. Medtronic (<a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=MDT\">MDT</a>) gives employees a “means to share in the company’s success” by enabling them to become shareholders through company-funded employee stock ownership plans.</p><em>6. Boost equity between workers and executives.</em><a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=MDT\">MDT</a><p>To rebuild trust and negate the impact of restrictive regulations, corporate boards must develop compensation systems that reward all employees fairly and are applied consistently. This will focus leaders on long-term value creation and give boards a solid footing from which to defend their policies. It might even enlighten policymakers as they figure out how to put Dodd-Frank into practice.</p><p></p>"

Now, a Harvard Business School professor is looking to the East as a model for developing strong business leaders.</p><p>William George, an expert on leadership development, recently teamed with Tibetan Buddhist meditation master<a href=\"http://tergar.org/\">Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche</a>&nbsp;to present a conference on “mindful leadership,” a secular process to explore the roles of self-awareness and self-compassion in developing strong and effective leaders.</p><a href=\"http://tergar.org/\">Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche</a><p>“To our knowledge, this is the first time that a Buddhist Rinpoche and a leadership professor have joined forces to explore this subject and see how Eastern teaching can inform our Western thinking about leadership and vice versa,” George says. You can read George’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/page/reflections-on-mindful-leadership-retreat\">summary of the Mindful Leadership conference</a>&nbsp;on his Web site.</p><a href=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/page/reflections-on-mindful-leadership-retreat\">summary of the Mindful Leadership conference</a><p>For George, leaders who don’t develop self-awareness are subject to becoming seduced by external rewards, such as power, money, and recognition. They also have difficulty acknowledging mistakes, an Achilles’ heel that has crippled a number of CEOs who have appeared in the news recently.</p><p>We have set up a forum for readers to give their own ideas on this concept and to ask Professor George questions.</p><p><strong>Sean Silverthorne:</strong>&nbsp;Tell us about the Mindful Leadership conference. What were the goals?</p><strong>Sean Silverthorne:</strong><p><strong>Bill George:</strong>&nbsp;The Mindful Leadership conference, which was held in Minneapolis August 13-14, 2010, brought together 400 participants in an exploration of how mindfulness can contribute to sustaining effective leadership. The seminar was co-led by Yongey Mingyur Rinpoche, a leading Buddhist meditation master, and myself.</p><strong>Bill George:</strong><p>Its goal was to bring together Western understanding about leadership and Eastern wisdom about the mind, developed from practices that have been used for thousands of years, to contribute to the self-awareness and self-compassion of leaders.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong>&nbsp;What is mindful leadership, and what are its benefits?</p><strong>Q:</strong><p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;Mindfulness is a state of being fully present, aware of oneself and other people, and sensitive to one’s reactions to stressful situations. Leaders who are mindful tend to be more effective in understanding and relating to others, and motivating them toward shared goals. Hence, they become more effective in leadership roles.</p><strong>A:</strong><p><strong>Q:</strong>&nbsp;How does one become mindfully aware?</p><strong>Q:</strong><p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;I would not claim to be an expert in this area. Our Mindful Leadership seminar focused on the practice of meditation as one of those ways, with a variety of meditation techniques taught by Rinpoche. This was strictly&nbsp;<em>a secular teaching</em>, not a Buddhist one. In my experience I have observed people become more mindful through prayer, introspective discussions, therapy, and the use of reflective techniques and exercises.</p><strong>A:</strong><em>a secular teaching</em><p><strong>Q:</strong>&nbsp;You have said that few leaders lose their jobs because of lack of intelligence, but many do so because of lack of emotional intelligence. Can you talk about this a little more and give some examples.</p><strong>Q:</strong><p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;Leaders with low emotional intelligence (EQ) often lack self-awareness and self-compassion, which can lead to a lack of self-regulation. This also makes it very difficult for them to feel compassion and empathy for others. Thus, they struggle to establish sustainable, authentic relationships.</p><strong>A:</strong><p>Leaders who do not take time for introspection and reflection may be vulnerable to being seduced by external rewards, such as power, money, and recognition. Or they may feel a need to appear so perfect to others that they cannot admit vulnerabilities and acknowledge mistakes. Some of the recent difficulties of Hewlett-Packard, British Petroleum, CEOs of failed Wall Street firms, and dozens of leaders who failed in the post-Enron era are examples of this.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong>&nbsp;The two essential aspects of effective leaders, you explain, are self-awareness and self-compassion.</p><strong>Q:</strong><p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;An essential aspect of effective leaders is authenticity; that is, being genuine and true to one’s beliefs, values, and principles that make up what we call someone’s True North.</p><strong>A:</strong><p>Authenticity is developed by becoming more self-aware and having compassion for oneself, without which it is very difficult to feel genuine compassion for others. Self-awareness starts with understanding one’s life story and the impact of one’s crucibles, and reflecting on how these contribute to motivations and behaviors. As people come to accept the less-favored parts of themselves that they do not like or have rejected, as well as learning from failures and negative experiences, they gain compassion for themselves and authenticity in relating to the world around them.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong>&nbsp;How does the work you are doing in this area align with your concept of “True North”?</p><strong>Q:</strong><p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;In our work on True North and in teaching authentic leadership development to students and seasoned leaders, we have learned that the greatest challenge to following one’s True North comes when the pressures and seductions are intense. That is when it is most crucial to be self-aware.</p><strong>A:</strong><p>This of course is not a new idea. Self-awareness is central to Daniel Goleman’s emotional intelligence. It is relatively rare to find people who are fully self-aware. Mindfulness is a logical step in this process of gaining self-awareness that should be combined with experiences in leading through challenging situations and gaining awareness through feedback and group support.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong>&nbsp;I know you are a strong believer in group support in the development of leaders. Can you talk a bit about how group support differs from mentorship, for example?</p><strong>Q:</strong><p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;Mentorship is a one-to-one process with someone who has greater experience and is willing to share from that experience. Group support as practiced in True North Groups consists of a small number of peers (usually five to eight) willing to share themselves and their lives and support each other through both good and difficult times. A key element of these groups is learning to give and receive nonjudgmental feedback in order to recognize blind spots, accept shortcomings, and gain the confidence to address great challenges in their lives.</p><strong>A:</strong><p><strong>Q:</strong>&nbsp;Do you think business schools should be paying more attention to this subject?</p><strong>Q:</strong><p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;Any business school committed to developing leaders needs to offer courses and other experiential opportunities that enable students to develop greater awareness of themselves, their motivations, and their strengths and shortcomings.</p><strong>A:</strong><p>This process is most effective when real-world experiences can be reflected upon to deepen self-understanding in a supportive and trusting environment. This is the central tenet of the Authentic Leadership Development (ALD) course at Harvard Business School, which will soon to be offered to leaders as part of the School’s Executive Education offerings.</p><p><strong>Q:</strong>&nbsp;If&nbsp;<em>HBS Working Knowledge</em>&nbsp;readers want to learn more about mindful leadership, which resources would you recommend?</p><strong>Q:</strong><em>HBS Working Knowledge</em><p><strong>A:</strong>&nbsp;Current literature on this subject is limited because the ideas are still in the early stages of development.

      "<p>Originially Posted in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.inc.com/guides/2010/08/how-to-become-a-servant-leader.html\">Inc.com&nbsp;</a><br>By Josh Spiro | August 31, 2010&nbsp;</p><a href=\"http://www.inc.com/guides/2010/08/how-to-become-a-servant-leader.html\">Inc.com&nbsp;</a><br><p>No business owner sets out to mistreat employees or customers. But not every entrepreneur puts an equal amount of thought into whether their employees are growing and being challenged or whether their customers need anything above and beyond what’s already being provided to them.</p><p>Servant leadership is a pretty intuitive concept; in fact you might be practicing it already unawares. However, it also clashes with many of the values instilled by modern American culture.</p><p>“I think the simplest way to explain it would be to say that servant leaders focus on identifying and meeting the needs of others rather than trying to acquire power, wealth, and fame for themselves,”says Kent Keith, CEO of the Greenleaf Center for Servant Leadership, a Westfield, Indiana-based non-profit that promotes education about and implementation of servant leadership.</p><p>But servant leadership goes even beyond your personal interactions within your company. “In business [practicing servant leadership] would start with your customers and ultimately [involve] serving society through the good work you’re doing on behalf of your customers,”says Bill George, a professor of management at Harvard Business School and the former CEO of Medtronic, a large medical technology company.</p><p>Here’s how to listen to and respect those you work with, flatten your organizational hierarchy, and stay focused doing it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to Become a Servant Leader: The Origins of Servant Leadership</strong></p><strong>How to Become a Servant Leader: The Origins of Servant Leadership</strong><p>The Greenleaf Center, which Keith presides over, takes its name from Robert Greenleaf, the originator of the concept of servant leadership. Greenleaf spent much of his career handling HR and personnel for AT&amp;T. “He observed over time that there were leaders who were in it for themselves and leaders who were in it for others,” Keith explains, “and his conclusion was that those who focused on others were the most effective.”</p><p>Greenleaf’s observations don’t just apply to the workings of a single company. Keith feels that the behaviors exemplified by servant leaders makes capitalism itself more efficient. “Servant leaders really are good at listening, they stay close to their colleagues, they have a good understanding of what their colleagues need to perform at a high level and they work hard to get that to them,” Keith explains. Another reason it boosts economic efficiency is “if you’re really paying attention, then you can provide the programs, products, and services that people really want.”</p><p><strong>How to Become a Servant Leader: Signs You Aren’t Practicing Servant Leadership</strong></p><strong>How to Become a Servant Leader: Signs You Aren’t Practicing Servant Leadership</strong><p>Much as Keith holds that servant leadership makes the wheels of free enterprise turn smoother, George believes that people practicing a very unservant-like form of leadership precipitated much of the recent economic crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>He says you can tell if you’re serving your own interests or those of others simply by how much and how well you’re listening to those around you. “Many entrepreneurs are brilliant people at getting a business going. They’re very self-determined, very committed, but you can see at some point in time a separation [between] them and their team and they feel like they’re carrying the weight of the world on their shoulders,”says George. When entrepreneurs shoulder an excessive portion of the burden, they neglect opportunities to delegate to their team, opportunities which would help them grow and develop as employees and as people. That’s why George cautions entrepreneurs not to play Atlas.</p><p>The antithesis of servant leadership, which Keith refers to as the “power, wealth and fame model,” also manifests in low employee morale and lower levels of commitment to the organization. “People kind of do their jobs and leave when the clock says five o’clock. They don’t put in any extra effort, they give you the minimum,” says George. High turnover rates can be another symptom.</p><p>One type of behavior, which can lower employee morale, is any examples of extreme executive privilege or hypocrisy. If a company “imposes very strict expense control limits on an organization, but spends lavishly themselves,” it creates a climate where people feel unfairness and hostility.</p><p><strong>How to Become a Servant Leader: Improving Your Servant Leadership</strong></p><strong>How to Become a Servant Leader: Improving Your Servant Leadership</strong><p>So becoming a servant leader sounds pretty straightforward so far but, as with most things, it’s far easier to talk the talk than to walk the walk. Here are suggestions for ways to reorganize your personal and professional habits to improve your servant leadership:</p><ul>\n<li><strong>Get started early</strong> – The best way to make servant leadership a part of how you run your business is to build it into the founding values of the company. “There’s a lot of talk these days about corporate social responsibility. I think the way that companies fulfill their responsibility to society is through the core missions of their business, not peripheral activities that look good to others but may not be central to the business,” says George. Building in profit sharing or other ways to let employees share in the company’s success is also important.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay introspective</strong> – When you’re directing so much energy outwards into your company it can be hard to recognize your own strengths and weaknesses and their impact on the people around you. It is a strategic necessity and potentially a source of stress relief getting others to step in where you fall short. George has been meditating since the 70’s although running and other forms of exercise can also work well as stress relievers that simultaneously provide reflection time.</li>\n<li><strong>Upend the pyramid</strong> – When your org chart looks like a steep pyramid with you at the top, it can cause a number of problems within the organization. Keith feels that people in those organizations focus excessively on pleasing their bosses to the exclusion of doing as much as they can for the customer. Additionally, “when you have that kind of a pyramid it’s hard for the person at the top to get information and it’s hard for that person to test new ideas,” Keith says. As a solution, he proposes a team at the top. The chief executive still retains final say on things but creates a flatter organization with more openness to dialogue and dissent.</li>\n<li><strong>Listen</strong> – One of the most central tenets of servant leadership is listening to the people around you and listening well. “Particularly if you’re successful,”George cautions, “you start to believe your own press, but when you get down with people and you get honest, gut-level feedback from them, [you ask] ‘Hey, how are things going?’ ‘Well they’re not going so well, here’s why.'”As CEO of Medtronic, George used to hold a program called Breakfast with Bill in which he would travel around the world to meet cross sections of the companies workforce, which was in the tens of thousands. Rather than meeting with management he sat down with employees from all levels of the organization.</li>\n<li><strong>Expand the family</strong> – Servant leadership also influences how you treat your suppliers and business partners, not just your customers and employees. Keith says that Greenleaf believed that “leaders of organizations should care about everyone that the organization touches.” So how can you try to develop mutually beneficial relationships rather than stoic exchanges of goods and services? George feels you should make vendors and partners feel like part of the family by selling them on the importance of the companies mission. TD Industries, a Texas-based mechanical construction company, invites their vendors to the servant leadership trainings that it hold for staff; and Kohler, Wisconsin-based Johnsonville Sausage sends their people out to work in restaurants and stores where their sausages are eaten and sold. It’s all about understanding each other’s philosophies and needs to improve the partnership and cooperation.</li>\n</ul><li><strong>Get started early</strong> – The best way to make servant leadership a part of how you run your business is to build it into the founding values of the company. “There’s a lot of talk these days about corporate social responsibility.

For starters, Keith says, “it’s more widely spread than we know, people just aren’t using the word servant leadership, but they’re doing what servant leaders do.”He was able to think of a number of large corporations who have practiced servant leadership, including Southwest Airlines, Starbucks, and FedEx, but far fewer examples of start-ups practicing it.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to business owners practicing servant leadership without giving it a name, there are certain misimpressions surrounding the practice of servant leadership that Keith hypothesizes might deter people from attempting it. “People hear about it and think ‘oh, it’s warm and fuzzy, but it doesn’t work.’ We’ve got plenty of evidence that it works from individuals and companies that are using it.”</p>"

Tom Emmer’s campaign for governor.</p><p>The protests started when Target Corporation gave $100,000 in cash and $50,000 in contributions to MN Forward, which is supporting Emmer’s bid for governor.</p><p>Emmer supports a constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. Target’s CEO apologized for the donation and said it would review its political donations, but the criticism continued.</p><p>Immigrant rights groups protested against the retailer because Emmer called the Arizona immigration law a “wonderful first step.” The liberal group MoveOn.org also started running an ad criticizing Target, and calling for a boycott, that said “our democracy is not for sale.”</p><p>Target isn’t the only Minnesota-based company that has given to MN Forward. Others include Best Buy, Red Wing Shoes and Polaris.</p><p>Campaign-finance reports show that a bulk of Minnesota’s Fortune 500 companies have not contributed to the group — and many are staying mum on whether they’ll get involved.</p><p>U.S. Bancorp, Ecolab and CH Robinson did not return calls seeking comment. Officials with General Mills, Hormel and 3M say they haven’t given money to MN Forward but wouldn’t say if they would. Medtronic spokesman Brian Henry said his company is weighing its options.</p><p>“We have been approached by MN Forward but at present we have not made a decision at this point regarding a contribution,” Henry said. “It’s important to note that in light of the recent Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court, we have been evaluating and updating our policy regarding corporate political contributions and the MN Forward is one that will be reviewed under this policy that we have.”</p><p>An official with UnitedHealth Group wouldn’t say whether his company has given or intends to give to MN Forward. A lobbyist for Cargill said her company will not give to the group because it has a policy of not giving to so-called 527 political groups. Officials with Land O’ Lakes, Xcel Energy and SuperValu say they also won’t give to the group.</p><p>The decision to get involved in politics can be a difficult one for a company and one that isn’t new. When basketball star and Nike spokesman Michael Jordan was asked why he refused to back a Democrat running for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina, Jordan responded “Republicans buy sneakers, too.”</p><p>That’s the problem with mixing business and politics, said Bill George, the former CEO of Medtronic and a one-time Target board member.</p><p>“I think it shows, unfortunately, that these things can reverberate because candidates have a multiplicity of positions,” he said.</p><p>George said MN Forward’s mission of focusing on improving the state’s economic climate is important, and there is no doubt that politics has a huge impact on business. But he predicts the controversy over Target’s donation has created a chilling effect in boardrooms across Minnesota.</p><p>“Nothing against MN Forward, because I think it’s well intentioned, but I think companies will take a hard look at this,” George said. “I think they will take a hard look at what the implications can be. And I think they should.”</p><p>Brian McClung, who directs MN Forward, said no company executives have told him they won’t give money to the group because of the Target controversy but says some are looking at Target’s experience. He said many companies are undeterred by the controversy.</p><p>“Many job providers are saying, ‘If we’re in a situation where special interests can intimidate and shut down legitimate speech than we’re all going to lose.'” he said. “So there are many job providers that believe the answer here isn’t to be swayed by this intimidation and boycotts and the like.”</p><p>That latest campaign finance reports show that 15 companies gave to the PAC through Aug. 10. McClung said other companies have given but declined to name them.</p><p>The information will be made available Sept. 21, the deadline for MN Forward and other political committees to file their fundraising report.</p>"

Hurd.\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/h/mark_v_hurd/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Mark V. Hurd</a><p>The directors had often talked with him about taking the world’s biggest technology company back to its roots as an innovator after the big-ticket acquisitions of 3Com and Palm. They doubted that Mr. Hurd, ever meticulous and boastful of his integrity, could commit such unscrupulous acts, according to people with knowledge of the board’s thinking.</p><p>But when he settled the woman’s harassment complaint in a late-night meeting before the board’s investigators had a chance to speak with her, the directors deemed his behavior just too troubling.</p><p>H.P.’s board rushed out Mr. Hurd’s resignation the next day, on Aug. 6. What has followed is a stream of leaks from both sides resulting in a very public imbroglio. The drama between staid H.P. and equally staid Mr. Hurd continues in a fashion quite unlike executive departures of its kind.</p><p>The company has uncovered communications between Mr. Hurd and Jodie Fisher, the occasional H.P. contractor who accused him of sexual harassment, that seemed cordial, even after a last meeting in a hotel room in Boise, Idaho, a person with knowledge of Mr. Hurd’s e-mails said.</p><p>But the board was increasingly troubled that Mr. Hurd had been so willing to put Ms. Fisher, whose job was to introduce Mr. Hurd to customers at H.P. marketing gatherings, in front of top customers at upscale company events. Nor could they fathom how Mr. Hurd could authorize more than $75,000 in payments and expenses, including first-class travel and stays in luxury hotels, for Ms. Fisher when the company’s employees traveled under more austere conditions, according to several people with knowledge of the expenses.</p><p>Mr. Hurd has been portrayed as engaging in increasingly questionable behavior as H.P. examined his relationship with Ms. Fisher. The directors could not grasp how he could defend having a close personal relationship with an expensive contractor and play down her background in sexually charged films like “Intimate Obsession” and “Body of Influence 2.” She also posed partly nude in&nbsp;<a title=\"More information about Playboy Enterprises Inc\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/playboy-enterprises-inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Playboy</a>&nbsp;while in college in the early 1980s.</p><a title=\"More information about Playboy Enterprises Inc\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/playboy-enterprises-inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Playboy</a><p>Simply put, he lost the board’s trust, said people with knowledge of the board’s thinking.</p><p>A person close to Mr. Hurd counters that H.P. officials are trumping up a version of events in conversations with reporters.</p><p>“Mark Hurd is shocked and enraged by allegations from an H.P. board source that by settling an unfounded sexual harassment claim he was impeding the board from learning the truth,” said this person close to Mr. Hurd.</p><p>Mr. Hurd had been encouraged by the directors to settle the claims for weeks, the person said.</p><p>People close to Mr. Hurd have argued that certain board members overreacted to the sexual harassment charges and the possible negative publicity if word of them leaked.</p><p>Company officials, meanwhile, have publicly stated that Mr. Hurd’s behavior ran far afoul of company policy. In particular, Mr. Hurd has been accused of trying to hide an inappropriate relationship with Ms. Fisher by altering his expense reports.</p><p>An H.P. spokeswoman, Christina Schneider, declined to comment on the matter.</p><p>Regardless, the company is getting exactly what it had hoped to avoid. It hired Kent Jarrell, a crisis management expert from the public relations firm APCO Worldwide, soon after the board received the harassment complaint at the end of June. Mr. Jarrell wrote a mock news story for the board, saying it could expect headlines about H.P.’s having a soft-core pornography star working its events, people with knowledge of Mr. Jarrell’s work said.</p><p>“This history here is important,” said Scott Stern, a business professor at the Sloan School of Management at&nbsp;<a title=\"More articles about Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/m/massachusetts_institute_of_technology/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">M.I.T.</a></p><a title=\"More articles about Massachusetts Institute of Technology\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/m/massachusetts_institute_of_technology/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">M.I.T.</a><p>Federal regulators are keeping a close eye on the H.P. board’s behavior after a scandal several years ago when factions of H.P.’s board spied on other members of the board, journalists and employees in an attempt to stop leaks. “This is a very proud company with a great history,” Mr. Stern said. “The fact is that you could understand that the board would be trigger-shy about public controversy.”</p><p>Mr. Hurd, according to those close to him, found it baffling that the company would disclose the sexual harassment case after a company investigation turned up no wrongdoing.</p><p>The accusations linking Mr. Hurd to improper spending resonate because he had built up a culture of severe financial accountability at H.P. A former H.P. executive said that Mr. Hurd’s meetings were known internally as “rectal exams” because of the fierce questioning.</p><p>“If you put up a slide with lower financial forecasts, he would spot it right away,” the executive said, requesting anonymity because he still deals with H.P. “Then, he would demand that you fix the situation.”</p><p>Stories abound of Mr. Hurd’s slicing into marketing costs and making employees fight for every dollar in the budget (although Mr. Hurd often found marketing money to sponsor tennis events, uniting his love of the sport with H.P.).</p><p>It’s this history that made Mr. Hurd’s recent behavior stand out to the board.</p><p>The situation was made worse after H.P. discovered that Mr. Hurd had viewed some of Ms. Fisher’s racy acting on his work computer, signaling that he was aware of her past.</p><p>Mr. Hurd has told people that he did a brief&nbsp;<a title=\"More information about Google Inc\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/google_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Google</a>&nbsp;search of Ms. Fisher in April or May of 2009, nearly two years after she started contract work for H.P.</p><a title=\"More information about Google Inc\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/google_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Google</a><p><a title=\"More articles about Lawrence J.

It also seeks punitive damages. Any money recovered would be awarded to H-P, not the plaintiffs.</p><p>An H-P spokeswoman and a spokesman for Mr. Hurd declined comment on the suit. An attorney at Scott+Scott LLP, which filed the suit, didn’t respond to a request for comment.</p><p>H-P’s board is ramping up its search for a new CEO.

Ms. Fisher had alleged sexual harassment by Mr. Hurd.</p><p>While an internal H-P investigation cleared Mr. Hurd of those claims, it found he failed to disclose a “close personal relationship” with Ms. Fisher and filed inaccurate expense reports.</p><p>H-P’s board consists largely of directors that Mr. Hurd helped recruit. Seven of the 10 directors got their seats after Mr. Hurd arrived in late March 2005.</p><p>The board’s makeup changed following a boardroom spying scandal in 2006. In its wake, three directors resigned—including its chairman. Mr. Hurd apologized before Congress and pledged to hold H-P to higher standards. He was named H-P chairman in September 2006.</p><p>H-P’s CEO-search committee is made up of venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, Joel Z. Hyatt, former CEO of Hyatt Legal Plans Inc., McKesson Corp. CEO John H. Hammergren and former Verizon Communications Inc. executive Lawrence Babbio. Mr. Andreessen has been the board’s public face, answering questions on a conference call following Mr. Hurd’s resignation.</p><p>Fellow directors probably relied on Mr. Andreessen because “he’s so well connected to global technology,” a person familiar with the matter said.</p><p>The lawsuit against the board also names Mr. Hurd and Cathie Lesjak, the H-P finance chief who is now also interim CEO.</p><p>Among other things, the 45-page suit alleges that H-P’s board violated its corporate-governance guidelines by failing to inform shareholders of the investigation. It also attacks details of Mr. Hurd’s exit package, which is estimated at above $35 million.</p><p>Shareholder derivative suits have become common in recent years. They are typically suits brought by shareholders on behalf of a company against a third party. In this case, the complaint was filed against the defendants on behalf of H-P.</p><p><cite>—Don Clark contributed to this article.</cite></p><cite>—Don Clark contributed to this article.</cite>"

American business was the envy of the world. Stock prices were soaring. Dozens of new companies were created every day. Private sector investments were at an all-time peak. Most importantly, the federal government had generated budget surpluses for three consecutive years.</p><p>What happened?</p><p>Two successive administrations and the Federal Reserve shifted the focus from investment to stimulating consumer spending with low interest rates, easy money, high leverage, low personal tax rates and increased government spending. The result? The federal deficit will hit $1.4 trillion this year, with cumulative debt reaching $18 trillion by 2015. That’s $60,000 for every American.</p><p>Since early 2009, economists have promised economic growth of 3 to 4 percent, saying that job growth — “a lagging indicator” — will surely follow. Eighteen months later, things have not improved. Estimates of growth in the gross domestic product continue to decline, as do durable goods orders. Twenty-six million Americans (16 percent of the work force) cannot find full-time jobs. After its 2009 rebound, stock prices are declining, reflecting growing pessimism.</p><p>While the fundamentals are awry for the United States, leading American companies are doing well. Second-quarter corporate earnings consistently exceeded expectations, as companies reported solid productivity gains. Corporate coffers have $1.8 trillion in cash. Yet companies are not investing — at least, not in America.</p><p>In talking with dozens of chief executives, I hear pragmatic managers focused on building their businesses and earning fair returns for shareholders, yet extremely concerned about government policy. Here are the real reasons they are not investing in America:</p><ol>\n<li>They expect no real domestic growth for the foreseeable future. In contrast, they foresee emerging markets sustaining double-digit growth. As a chief executive at a large consumer products company told me: “Half our revenues already come from Asia; within 10 years it will be 70 percent. Naturally, we are shifting more operations there.”</li>\n<li>To compete with local companies, global companies are investing overseas in factories and sales and marketing personnel. Foreign governments like China and Singapore make investments very attractive. One chief executive noted that he chose China for his $62 million factory because local subsidies reduced his investment to only $13 million.</li>\n<li>Companies are also moving infrastructure support from the United States to lower-cost areas in Asia. Unable to obtain visas for its Indian employees, a major computer software company moved most of its software operations to India, where well-educated employees enjoy higher standards of living at one-quarter of the cost.</li>\n<li>Without domestic growth, there is no need for additional employees. Instead, companies are achieving productivity gains by running lean. Mounting costs of doing business and increased benefit costs have created so much uncertainty that chief executives are reluctant to hire, especially small business owners.</li>\n<li>Chief executives feel they have access in Washington, but limited influence. Without any business people in the Obama administration, there are no advocates for sound business policies. A successful commercial banker described how open the president appeared to his concerns, yet the next day — without any consultation — the administration announced a new $50 billion bank tax.</li>\n</ol><li>They expect no real domestic growth for the foreseeable future.

Unless the climate in Washington changes dramatically, this no-growth, no-jobs environment will continue indefinitely.</p><p>How can the administration reverse this economic malaise?</p><p>To get the country growing and Americans back to work, the government must shift course to invest in America. Tax policies and incentives should stimulate private sector companies to invest domestically in research, innovation, manufacturing, infrastructure and exports.</p><p>Here are six specific ways to accomplish this shift:</p><ol>\n<li>Double the investment tax credit for new tangible assets to encourage investment.</li>\n<li>Double tax credits for increases in research and development to stimulate research and innovation.</li>\n<li>Introduce a graduated capital gains tax based on length of time assets are held, with rates declining to zero after 10 years.</li>\n<li>Offer a capital gains tax holiday the first time companies are sold to encourage investment in start-ups.</li>\n<li>Grant special loans and job credits for small businesses, where 70 percent of jobs are created.</li>\n<li>Offer export tax credits for the next two years to reinvigorate export growth and rebalance trade.</li>\n</ol><li>Double the investment tax credit for new tangible assets to encourage investment.</li><li>Double tax credits for increases in research and development to stimulate research and innovation.</li><li>Introduce a graduated capital gains tax based on length of time assets are held, with rates declining to zero after 10 years.</li><li>Offer a capital gains tax holiday the first time companies are sold to encourage investment in start-ups.</li><li>Grant special loans and job credits for small businesses, where 70 percent of jobs are created.</li><li>Offer export tax credits for the next two years to reinvigorate export growth and rebalance trade.</li><p>This set of pro-investment, pro-growth policies would supercharge American investment, rekindle innovation, create millions of sustainable jobs and restore continued economic growth. This would result in increasing tax receipts that would pay back these tax credits many times over.</p><p>Most important of all, this would make America competitive once again, focusing on our strengths of entrepreneurship, innovation and creativity.</p><p>It’s time to invest in America once again.</p><p></p>"

When a problem arises, we look for the villain who caused it. Then we search for the perfect leader to guide us out of the wilderness, only to find they have feet of clay.</p><p>It’s time to recognize that leaders are just as imperfect as the rest of us. Instead we need authentic leaders — people who own their mistakes and acknowledge their faults. More importantly, we need leaders who always put the interests of their organizations ahead of their self-interests.</p><p>Young leaders need role models whose actions provide guidance for their leadership. My role model is Minnesota’s Winston Wallin. Now in his mid-80s, Win is former chairman and CEO of Medtronic and my ex-boss.</p><p>He’s had three distinguished careers — at Pillsbury, Medtronic and the University of Minnesota. As a board member, Win made major contributions to the success of such important Minnesota corporations as Cargill and Norwest Bank (now Wells Fargo). But his greatest legacy may be the Wallin Education Scholars, a program that’s enabling thousands of high school students to attend Minnesota’s colleges.</p><p>Recently Win and I had a thoughtful discussion in his gazebo. He still combines keen insights and laser-sharp focus on what’s most important along with a wicked, self-deprecating sense of humor. No matter how tough things seem to be, Win can lighten up any group with a clever line. As we talked, Win shared his wisdom and perspective about the challenges we faced together at Medtronic, and even more passion for the Wallin Educational Scholars. His commitment to help people is stronger than ever.</p><p>After graduating from University of Minnesota, Win joined Pillsbury, where he spent 37 years, rising to president and chief operating officer. The Pillsbury board made a grievous error in not choosing him to succeed Bill Spoor as CEO, one for which the corporation paid dearly. When Spoor’s successor failed, Pillsbury fell prey to a hostile takeover by Britain’s Grand Metropolitan PLC. After years of malaise under Grand Met and its successor Diageo, Pillsbury was acquired by Minnesota-based General Mills.</p><p>Beyond pacemakers</p><p>Pillsbury’s loss was Medtronic’s gain. Win accepted the board’s request to become chairman and CEO in 1985. Medtronic was floundering, due in part to a mishandled quality problem. But it didn’t take Win long to recognize that Medtronic’s entire future was at risk: Medtronic was blocked from entering the nascent implantable defibrillator market by a pioneering patent held by archrival Eli Lilly.</p><p>Ironically, Michel Mirowski, inventor of the defibrillator, had worked for Medtronic until the company unceremoniously dismissed him and told him to take his patent with him. Lilly purchased exclusive rights to his design and patent.</p><p>Win saw something few others realized: Not only was Medtronic blocked from this essential market but its mainstream pacemaker business was vulnerable. Win’s first act was to charge Medtronic pacemaker chief Bobby Griffin with launching a massive R&amp;D effort to get Medtronic into the defibrillator business. In typical Wallin style, he told Griffin, “Spend whatever it takes.”</p><p>Soon Lilly sued Medtronic to halt its defibrillator research, and a Philadelphia judge ordered the company to “cease and desist” all efforts. At this point most executives would back off. Not Win Wallin.</p><p>Undeterred, he shifted the defibrillator project to Medtronic’s Dutch research center, beyond the purview of U.S. courts. He then hired former Pillsbury general counsel Ron Lund and told him to get the court’s decision overturned at any cost. In 1990, Medtronic won a 6-3 decision from the U.S. Supreme Court.</p><p>Win also recognized that the company was too reliant on pacemakers, in part due to several failed attempts at diversification. So he hired Dr. Glen Nelson as vice chairman in 1986, and together they began to diversity Medtronic’s business.</p><p>Two years later, Win contacted me while I was at Honeywell about joining the company as president and chief operating officer. Initially, I declined because I was immersed in turning around Honeywell’s space and aviation business. After we got that business back on track, I called Win. Joining Medtronic in 1989 was the best move of my career.</p><p>My first week on the job, Win told me, “Bill, don’t worry about the numbers for six months. Get out and learn the business from the top doctors.” That sent me on a quest to work with some of the world’s finest physicians by gowning up and watching them implant everything from pacemakers to defibrillators and stents.</p><p>Win retired from Medtronic in 1991, but he certainly didn’t retire from life. In addition to chairing Medtronic’s board, he joined five corporate boards where he provided invaluable advice.</p><p>Wallin also answered U of M President Nils Hasselmo’s request to help the U turn around its struggling health sciences area. At the time the medical school was being challenged by the FDA for selling unapproved transplant drugs. Win dove into his new job and helped get the academic medical center back on track.</p><p>In the early 1990s he and his wife, Maxine, formed the Wallin Foundation, setting aside a significant proportion of their gains from Medtronic stock. Together they started a scholarship program at South High School in Minneapolis for talented students from low-income families. Eventually the program was converted to a private operating foundation now known as Wallin Education Partners. More than 3,000 students have benefitted from $26 million in scholarships.</p><p>Aspiring young leaders look to high-profile success stories like Apple’s Steve Jobs and Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg. For a model of sustainable success impacting the lives of millions of people, they would do well to look to Win Wallin. They won’t find a more authentic leader anywhere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

George, a professor of management at Harvard Business School who is the former chairman and chief executive officer of&nbsp;Medtronic&nbsp;and currently a director of both&nbsp;ExxonMobiland&nbsp;Goldman Sachs. He talked about how leadership in business is going through a huge and dramatic transformation as the baby boom gives way to younger executives with very different ways of seeing the world, connecting and working. He also talked about what it takes to be a strong leader in a challenging time. (In an earlier part of our conversation, available&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2010/07/06/bill-george-health-care-leadership-citizenship-ethisphere.html\">here</a>, we discussed leadership, ethics and compliance in the health care industry.)</p><a href=\"http://www.forbes.com/2010/07/06/bill-george-health-care-leadership-citizenship-ethisphere.html\">here</a><p><strong>You have said that the younger generation, people under 45 or so, should be taking over in business because they are showing stronger leadership and more focus on their “true north” than their seniors. What do you mean by that?</strong></p><strong>You have said that the younger generation, people under 45 or so, should be taking over in business because they are showing stronger leadership and more focus on their “true north” than their seniors. What do you mean by that?</strong><p>I think we are going through a massive generational change in leadership. We baby boomers were raised in an era coming out of two world wars and the Depression that our parents had experienced. We didn’t live through that, but our parents’ experience was very real to us. From that we developed a command-and-control mentality of how to run an organization.</p><p>The great corporations of the world in the 1950s and ’60s were command-and-control organizations. With this new century, that concept of command and control has totally gone out, because employees today are knowledge workers, they have options, and they don’t stay around. Most important, they’re looking for meaning, not just money. I think today’s great leaders will know how to empower people, all of us, to step up and lead. So it’s not a command-and-control type situation, and it’s not exerting power over the people. It’s aligning people to a mission and values and getting them to step up and lead, and getting them to recognize that their job is to serve a certain customer first and not the shareholder.</p><p>That’s what I think the younger generation, those under 40 or 45, really understands. I think particularly for my students who are in their late twenties this is a great opportunity. The global economic meltdown of 2008 and 2009 was a crucible experience for them in that they recognize that the way we were going until then was headed for sheer destruction. They have a chance to recover, whereas a lot of the older leaders of Wall Street are passing from the scene and have no chance to recover.</p><p>I think the decade of 2000 to 2010 will go down as the lost decade of leadership. It started with the collapse of the dot-coms, which were our great hope for the future. We went from venture capitalists starting up great companies like&nbsp;Intel,&nbsp;Google,&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;and&nbsp;Starbucks&nbsp;to trying to make money on paper. People thought they could quickly develop a business plan, take it to the market, run an initial public offering and make a lot of money, all in 12 to 18 months. It was all nonsense, and it all collapsed.</p><p>That started the decade, and then right behind it came Enron, WorldCom,&nbsp;Tyco&nbsp;and some real ethical problems. You see people like Bernie Ebbers and Jeff Skilling behind bars, but the real story is that there were 200 major companies like Bristol-Myers and&nbsp;Xerox&nbsp;that had to restate their numbers by some 2 to 3 billion dollars in income because of ethical deviations, because of inappropriate accounting driven by ethical considerations.</p><p>And of course we closed the decade with the financial meltdown of the last two years. That really came, in my opinion, from Wall Street, which had been pressing its leaders for short-term outcomes, playing the short-term game so much that they self-destructed. You had great financial institutions like&nbsp;Citigroup, which was the greatest bank in the world when I was growing up, self-destruct. They had to go to the government for a combination of bailouts and loan guarantees of around $350 billion. These financial institutions were all built like a house of cards. Someone pulled out the bottom card and the whole place collapsed.</p><p>I think in leadership terms that’s a huge wake-up call. After Enron and Sarbanes-Oxley, corporate leaders got the word. Wall Street didn’t get the word.</p><hr><p><strong>Very often ethics and compliance problems are said to be caused by just one employee. A single person makes a misguided decision, perhaps to bribe a foreign official or make a false claim. How can leaders let people know that their ethical standards really apply to the entire organization from the top down, and don’t just exist to satisfy regulatory requirements?</strong></p><strong>Very often ethics and compliance problems are said to be caused by just one employee. A single person makes a misguided decision, perhaps to bribe a foreign official or make a false claim. How can leaders let people know that their ethical standards really apply to the entire organization from the top down, and don’t just exist to satisfy regulatory requirements?</strong><p>Today’s leaders need to be directly engaged with their people all around the world. It takes an enormous amount of time. They need to be asking questions: How do we do business? What happens when you get asked for favors? What do you do? How do you handle this? You need to trust but verify. You need to have a verification and compliance system.</p><p>When there are any deviations, it should be a zero-tolerance policy, with no second chance. If you make mistakes, if you make poor business decisions, you should get a second chance. If you have quality problems, you should get a second chance. If you have operational problems, you should get a second chance. On questions of company values there is no second chance. Everybody needs to know that. You need to publicize it. You need to not cover it up.</p><p>It’s really important in organizations that you not just blame people at the lowest levels. You have to look at the whole chain of command. That was Shell’s problem in Nigeria. They didn’t look at everyone. You can’t just blame the low-level people, you have got to look at what the management is doing and saying, because they’re there, too.</p><p>I felt that responsibility every day. We had ethical violations at&nbsp;Medtronic. I had to fire the head of Europe. I had to fire the head of Japan. I had to fire the head of China. It was very embarrassing for me that it took so long to clean up, but we went right at it and we finally got the message across that this is the way we do business.</p><p>Ed Breen did a very good job cleaning up Tyco. I don’t have as high regard for Dennis Koslowski, because it was kind of anything goes in his era. But I think Breen has sent a clear message: This is how you do business. Just as Anne Mulcahy did at Xerox. There were some ethical questions there, and she did a really good job cleaning things up.</p><p>So I think we need to vet, not just criticize, people who violate ethical standards. We also need to uphold those leaders who really do want to make a difference.</p><p><strong>In&nbsp;<em>7 Lessons</em>&nbsp;you have a lesson titled “Don’t Be Atlas.” In that lesson you mention that it’s good for leaders to have an outside team that can help them get through a crisis. Do you have your own outside team that has helped you get through crises?</strong></p><strong>In&nbsp;<em>7 Lessons</em>&nbsp;you have a lesson titled “Don’t Be Atlas.” In that lesson you mention that it’s good for leaders to have an outside team that can help them get through a crisis. Do you have your own outside team that has helped you get through crises?</strong><em>7 Lessons</em><p>It starts with having one person with whom you can be entirely open. That person for me is my wife, Penny. If I get too high on myself, she’ll pull me back down, and if I get really down, she’ll give me a practical view of things. She’s just great and extremely helpful. I also have a men’s group that I meet with every Wednesday morning, and we talk about really important issues in life.

I’m most hopeful about the new leaders who have been appointed in the last three or four years at corporations large and small. I’m hopeful we can get a whole new generation that will step up and lead with a higher sense of ethics and values, not just for its own sake but for recognizing that that’s the best way to build an organization and the right way to sustain success.</p><p><em>The first part of this interview appeared <a href=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/articles/bill-george-on-the-ill-health-of-health-care/\">here</a></em></p><em>The first part of this interview appeared <a href=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/articles/bill-george-on-the-ill-health-of-health-care/\">here</a></em><a href=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/articles/bill-george-on-the-ill-health-of-health-care/\">here</a>"

George, a professor of management at Harvard Business School who is the former chairman and chief executive officer of&nbsp;Medtronic&nbsp;and a current director of both&nbsp;ExxonMobiland&nbsp;Goldman Sachs.</p><p><em>We talked about leadership, ethics and compliance in the health care industry and also–in the second part of this interview, to be published later–about his latest book,</em>&nbsp;7 Lessons for Leading in a Crisis<em>, in which he gives concrete advice on how to be a strong leader in a challenging time.

Can you give an example of a leader in the health care industry who does that?</strong></p><strong>You say that leaders should lead by following the compass of their “true north,” meaning their integrity and their values. Can you give an example of a leader in the health care industry who does that?</strong><p>One person who I’ve served with on a board and who recently stepped down from his company is Dan Vasella, chief executive officer of&nbsp;Novartis, the Swiss pharmaceutical company. Novartis has a large generics business; they’ve got the H1N1 vaccine and a large vaccine business; and they have a consumer health business. But the significant thing about Dan is that he recognizes that all corporations exist first to serve society. If a corporation doesn’t serve society by using its strengths, then in the end it will have very difficult times.</p><p>If a corporation focuses only on maximizing shareholder value, as Milton Friedman erroneously recommended, it will probably eventually implode or self-destruct–as General Motors did, and as Sears Roebuck did–from not recognizing its job of serving the customer. I think part of that “serving the customer” is societal concern. For example, Vasella recognizes that not all patients have the wherewithal to pay, so Novartis has had a big focus on malaria in Africa, where they are giving away a drug called Coartem.</p><p>They also recognize the need to collaborate with nongovernmental organizations and to collaborate with governments, because Novartis cannot deliver the drug to Africa by itself. So it’s a whole team effort, a whole collaboration–and I think Dan Vasella recognizes that.</p><p><strong>Are there ethical questions in the health care industry that you see requiring particular focus from industry leaders?</strong></p><strong>Are there ethical questions in the health care industry that you see requiring particular focus from industry leaders?</strong><p>If you start with, broadly speaking, the provider side of health care, we have a huge issue in that the incentives are all misaligned, even with the health care reform bill. The current incentives encourage doing more procedures, giving more tests, seeing more people–but not keeping people healthy. So I think there is a huge ethical dilemma in health care in general.</p><p>But how do we get to a health care system designed to keep people healthy and not just treat them while they’re sick? That gets to the really tough ethical question of lifestyle. Seventy percent of all health care costs arise from people’s inappropriate lifestyles. Obesity is No. 1 and the most rapidly growing disease. Of course, you don’t hear of it as obesity. You hear of it as Type 2 diabetes. I think that is a real ethical question for providers of health care.</p><hr><p>In terms of suppliers–the pharmaceutical and medical technology companies–it’s hard to think that over the long term they will be successful selling into an unhealthy system. So I think it incumbent upon the pharmaceutical, biotech and medical technology companies to start trying to create a healthy system.</p><p>Certainly insurance companies are a big contributor to an unhealthy system. They are not helpful right now. We need insurance companies to start insuring companies and people for staying well, rather than just insuring them for staying sick. We have to get upstream of the problem. I don’t see a lot being done there right now.</p><p>We need to look at the whole person, which is what my wife is talking about with our George Family Foundation. There are huge mind-body connections. Placebo effects are real. It’s a positive thing, even though most look at it as a negative thing. If you think you’re going to be healthy, your odds are better. How do we create that kind of sense of well-being, and how do we get people to honor their commitment to exercise and diet to stay healthy, and all those things?</p><p>John Mackey of&nbsp;Whole Foods&nbsp;is trying to do that. But who is doing that in the health care industry? Who is taking the lead on that and really trying to make a difference in people’s health? We did a lot of things atMedtronic, but Medtronic is just one player. What are other companies doing to make a difference in terms of the health of their employees? I think it’s essential that health care companies take a lead in creating a healthier health care system. That means a healthier population, not just promoting their own products, drugs or insurance plans.</p>"

      "<p><em>Originally Published in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/business/97694684.html?elr=KArks7PYDiaK7DUdcOy_nc:DKUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU\">Star-Tribune</a></em>&nbsp;on July 3, 2010</p><em>Originally Published in the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/business/97694684.html?elr=KArks7PYDiaK7DUdcOy_nc:DKUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU\">Star-Tribune</a></em><a href=\"http://www.startribune.com/business/97694684.html?elr=KArks7PYDiaK7DUdcOy_nc:DKUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUU\">Star-Tribune</a><p>As a lifelong businessman, I was surprised to be invited to speak to the Association of Union Contractors last year. They told me they’re searching for “win-win” solutions between their members, the contractors and the owners. For many years they’d seen their membership shrink as owners turned instead to non-union contractors when costs rose to noncompetitive levels.</p><p>They recognized that union contractors had been badly hurt by the recession. Instead of continuing the battles through “win-lose” negotiations, they adopted a new approach. They decided to use their members’ expertise to work collaboratively with contractors and owners to find ways to improve construction quality and employee safety while reducing costs and time-to-completion. A win-win solution.</p><p>That got me to reflecting, isn’t this what leadership is all about? Isn’t it the ability to solve complex problems that single-minded groups couldn’t resolve by bringing together differing points of view to create win-win solutions? Isn’t this vastly superior to win-lose confrontations that result in damaged relationships, drawn-out strikes that hurt both sides and the inability to work together collaboratively?</p><p>Rarely do win-win solutions represent a decisive victory for a single viewpoint. Nor are win-win approaches about Washington-style political compromises in which all parties wrangle until both compromise sufficiently to reach an agreement that too often doesn’t solve basic problems and creates unanticipated consequences.</p><p>Rather, great leaders work together with people who represent diverse views to forge solutions that transcend immediate conflicts. Together they devise solutions that will be successful for all parties in the environment of the future. That’s the way great organizations are transformed in order to sustain their success, and the way they ensure superior service to their customers and clients.</p><p>IBM is a case in point. To overcome parochialism and traditional squabbles between business and geographical organizations, CEO Sam Palmisano converted IBM’s entire 400,000-employee organization from a geographic structure to an integrated global network, and from a task orientation to “leading by values.”&nbsp;</p><p>Palmisano insisted that functional managers and country managers alike give priority to customers scattered around the globe by sending their top people to customer sites instead of hoarding them for their own organizations. That led to a $500 million contract with China’s largest bank, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, for a fully integrated information and communications network. Palmisano not only enlisted the collaborative support of hundreds of contractors, but insisted they adhere to IBM’s global business practices rather than following their local business traditions.</p><p>Other companies ranging from Cisco Systems to Exxon-Mobil, Novartis and Unilever are adopting similar approaches to create win-win solutions for their customers and prevent parochial issues from getting in the way.</p><p><strong>The nurses contract</strong></p><strong>The nurses contract</strong><p>This brings to mind the contentious contract negotiations between the Minnesota Nurses Association and Twin Cities hospitals, where both sides seemed to be digging ever deeper holes for win-lose postures. Ironically, both sides in this dispute share a common goal: to provide superior care to patients.</p><p>Looking ahead to the new health care environment, three things are certain: 1) sharp reimbursement reductions for Medicare, Medicaid, and private health plans are coming; 2) to survive in this environment, quality of patient care must go up; and 3) costs must come down.</p><p>Nurses should be treated as professionals who are given opportunities to take on greater levels of responsibility in the new health care environment. Using nurses more effectively is vital to raising health care quality at reduced cost. It is well known how much patients value their relationships with their nurses, especially in the Twin Cities, which has one of the best records for patient care of any metropolitan area in the United States.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The nurses’ union and the hospitals reached a tentative agreement Thursday</strong>. But&nbsp;since they are both committed to patient care, nurses and hospitals could work together in the coming months to figure out how to improve patient care with higher quality outcomes at lower costs.</p><strong>The nurses’ union and the hospitals reached a tentative agreement Thursday</strong><p>In the health care environment of the future, nurses should work in teams with doctors. This would require high levels of collaboration, increased knowledge and skills, and greater flexibility in assignments and scheduling, all of which would lead to increased opportunities for promotion and&nbsp; enhanced compensation.</p><p><strong>A new approach</strong></p><strong>A new approach</strong><p>In this context restricting nurses to rigid schedules may be inconsistent with patient needs. This is especially true in the case of those invaluable nurses who engage in delivery of babies, life-altering surgeries, and the frequent emergencies that arise in hospitals. With these broadened professional responsibilities, strikes by nurses would become an anachronism, just like they would be if physicians walked off the job and left thousands of patients without essential medical care.</p><p>As we look at the major societal problems we face, it becomes clear that the win-lose approaches are not going to solve the intractable issues in education, in energy and the environment, and in pursuit of global peace. Instead, they are leading to greater conflicts, increased anger on all sides, and extended delays in moving forward to devise and implement workable solutions.</p><p>What if we apply the win-win approach to:</p><ul>\n<li>Create more flexible approaches to educating K-12 students, enabling them to learn in their own ways and at their own pace, and ultimately prepare them better for the working world?</li>\n<li>Develop an integrated energy policy that recognizes the need for improved efficiency, reduced carbon emissions, and renewable energy sources, yet recognizes the vital role that fossil fuels will play for the foreseeable future?</li>\n<li>Devise peaceful solutions to intractable ethnic problems that acknowledge the interdependence of all sides and enable the people suffering from the disputes not only to live in peace, but to realize their material and spiritual goals at the same time?</li>\n</ul><li>Create more flexible approaches to educating K-12 students, enabling them to learn in their own ways and at their own pace, and ultimately prepare them better for the working world?</li><li>Develop an integrated energy policy that recognizes the need for improved efficiency, reduced carbon emissions, and renewable energy sources, yet recognizes the vital role that fossil fuels will play for the foreseeable future?</li><li>Devise peaceful solutions to intractable ethnic problems that acknowledge the interdependence of all sides and enable the people suffering from the disputes not only to live in peace, but to realize their material and spiritual goals at the same time?</li><p>Utopian? Not at all. We know that the consequences of win-lose negotiations mean that everyone loses. We have seen that win-win solutions enable both parties to flourish.</p><p>It’s time to give the win-win approach the opportunity to help us solve our most difficult problems.</p>"

First, there was BP CEO Tony Hayward losing responsibility for the day to day management of the Gulf oil disaster. Then four star Army General Stanley McChrystal lost his job as top military commander in Afghanistan. Are these isolated cases of bad leadership or something more? Bill George is back with us. He`s the former CEO of Medtronic, professor of management practice at Harvard Business School. He`s with us tonight from Minneapolis. Welcome back to NBR Bill.</p><p>BILL GEORGE, PROFESSOR, HARVARD BUSINESS SCHOOL: Thanks Tom.</p><p>HUDSON: So what do you think? Were these from bad actions by good leaders or were they just unprepared for their situations?</p><p>GEORGE: Well, they were clearly unprepared for these situations. And I`m frankly extremely disappointed. We have had too many of these lately. I don`t know what General McChrystal was thinking in talking to “Rolling Stone,” but he wasn`t really thinking about the war like he should have been and the fact that he`s part of the chain of command. And I think in his case, President Obama did absolutely the right thing to relieve him. But more importantly, putting a leader like General Petraeus on the ground in Afghanistan that the American people have confidence in, because the bigger issue here is not General McChrystal. It`s the war itself and how it is prosecuted.</p><p>HUDSON: . going over to Hayward. What about Tony Hayward? He seems to take responsibility. In fact he went in front of Congress last week and he said quote, I feel a great sense of responsibility for the accident. He said that in front of Congress under oath and General McChrystal hasn`t denied any of those harsh comments attributed to him, saying before he resigned it was a mistake reflecting poor judgment and should have never happened. Why do you think these two people at the top of their industries were so unprepared?</p><p>GEORGE: Well, I think that Mr. Hayward was not really prepared for the big environment of the public eye. He`s a very good operator. He`s done a good job in the past for BP, but the company needed to make a lot of changes. He didn`t make them fast enough, to reinforce safety practices, maintenance practices make it a lot more conservative than it was and frankly make a lot more investment in their systems. And they took risks and it backfired on them. And Hayward to his credit took responsibility, but he still hasn`t been on the ground enough. He ought to be in New Orleans. He ought to be with the people. He ought to be seen and there and taking action every day. Even if he`s got a team of technical experts leading it, he`s got to be the one to be seen leading it.</p><p>HUDSON: So Bill, you have worked with leaders both in the boardroom and the classroom, what do you think the message is here for future leaders?</p><p>GEORGE: Get prepared. And you only get prepared Tom, by testing yourself in crisis. Don`t hang out as a consultant or an analyst, get on the field and be on the ground and test yourself in a smaller crisis so when the big one comes, which by the way Tom you can never predict when that`s going to come. You`re ready to take it on and you have a sense of what it`s like to be in the public eye and what the pressures are and the responsibilities you have to carry a huge organization on your back.</p><p>HUDSON: We`ll leave it there, always great insights, along with us our guest this evening, Bill George, professor of management practice at Harvard.</p><p>GEORGE: Thank you very much, Tom.</p>"

Icahn.\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/i/carl_c_icahn/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Carl C. Icahn</a>&nbsp;continues to challenge the biotechnology industry. His latest target is&nbsp;<strong><a title=\"More information about Genzyme Corp\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/genzyme_corporation/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Genzyme</a></strong>, one of the most successful companies in this innovative field, where he is seeking four seats on its board.</p>\n<p>This is Mr. Icahn’s sixth biotechnology target, and these moves epitomize the struggle between investors like Mr. Icahn, who advocate maximizing short-term shareholder value, and an industry in which enormous investments and extended time frames are required to create long-term shareholder value.</p>\n<p>Genzyme is the biotech industry’s second-largest company, with revenues of $4.5 billion and a market capitalization of about $13 billion. Previously, Mr. Icahn has taken on smaller companies:&nbsp;<strong>Biogen-Idec</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>MedImmune</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>ImClone Systems</strong>,&nbsp;<strong><a title=\"More information about Amylin Pharmaceuticals Incorporated\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/amylin-pharmaceuticals-inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Amylin Pharmaceuticals</a></strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a title=\"More information about Enzon Incorporated\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/enzon-pharmaceuticals-inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Enzon</a>&nbsp;Pharmaceuticals</strong>.</p>\n<p>The biotechnology industry is one of America’s most promising and innovative, and one in which this country has a clear competitive advantage. It has benefited from billions of dollars in government-sponsored research at the&nbsp;<a title=\"More articles about National Institutes of Health, U.S.\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/n/national_institutes_of_health/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">National Institutes of Health</a>&nbsp;and leading research universities. Even so, new biotechnology drugs take 12 to 15 years to bring to market, with the attendant risks of high failure rates in research trials.</p>\n<p>Early pioneers like&nbsp;<strong>Genentech</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong><a title=\"More information about Amgen Inc\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/amgen_inc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Amgen</a></strong>&nbsp;created breakthrough drugs that saved millions of lives while amassing shareholder value of $98 billion for Genentech, after its sale to&nbsp;<strong><a title=\"More information about Roche Holding A.G.\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/roche-holding-ag/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Roche</a></strong>, and $50 billion for Amgen. Both companies spent more than a decade investing billions of dollars in research before marketing their pioneering products.</p>\n<p>In contrast, investors like Mr. Icahn believe shareholders should maximize their short-term value by selling biotech companies to pharmaceutical companies hungry for new drugs. In recent years, the large pharmaceutical companies have struggled to create life-saving drugs in their own laboratories and are often reluctant to tackle the complex diseases that the biotechnology industry has pursued.</p>\n<p>What are the implications of these shareholder challenges? No doubt, investors like Mr. Icahn can yield quick profits for investors, but they come with a potentially high cost. In the end, will there be a biotechnology industry capable of the long-term investments required to thrive?</p>\n<p>Mr. Icahn made his first move in biotechnology in 2002 with an attempted takeover of ImClone Systems. Following an insider trading scandal that sent the company’s chief executive, Sam Waksal, to prison along with his close friend,&nbsp;<a title=\"More articles about Martha Stewart.\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/martha_stewart/index.html?inline=nyt-per\">Martha Stewart</a>, Mr. Icahn won a 2006 proxy contest to elect four members of ImClone’s board. The interim chief executive, Joseph Fischer, was replaced by Dr. Alex Denner, a genetics professor at Harvard Medical School. In 2008, the company was sold to the pharmaceutical giant&nbsp;<strong><a title=\"More information about Lilly, Eli, &amp; Company\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/lilly_eli_and_company/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">Eli Lilly</a></strong>&nbsp;for $6.5 billion.</p>\n<p>MedImmune was next in line in 2007. After a short battle, the company was purchased by<strong><a title=\"More information about AstraZeneca PLC\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/astrazeneca_plc/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">AstraZeneca</a></strong>&nbsp;for $15.6 billion.</p>\n<p>When Mr. Icahn focused on Biogen-Idec in 2007, its board offered the company for sale. When no bids came in, the sale was withdrawn. In 2008, Mr. Icahn again challenged Biogen’s board and its chief executive, James Muller, and began an unsuccessful proxy contest. A second proxy contest succeeded last June in electing two of Mr. Icahn’s candidates to the Biogen board, including Dr. Denner. Mr. Muller resigned in January as Mr. Ichan won board approval to appoint two additional board members.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, two smaller biotechnology companies, Enzon and Amylin, have also experienced Mr. Icahn’s challenges. Since he urged the spinoff of Enzon’s biotechnology business in 2007, Mr. Icahn has been successful in adding two directors and Dr. Denner was elected chairman of Enzon’s board.

Yet when Lehman collapsed into bankruptcy in September 2008, just one of its ten non-executive directors had any recent banking experience. He had joined the board five months before Lehman went bust.</p><p>The backgrounds of Lehman’s independent directors were hardly suited to overseeing a complicated financial entity. Directors included a retired art-auction company executive; the former CEO of a Spanish-language television company; a retired rear admiral who had headed the Girl Scouts and served on the board of Weight Watchers International; a theatrical producer; and, until two years before Lehman’s downfall, the 83-year-old actress and socialite Dina Merrill, who sat on the board for eighteen years and served on the compensation committee that approved CEO Richard Fuld’s $484 million in salary, stock options, and bonuses from 2000 to 2007.</p><p>John Helyar, coauthor of&nbsp;<em>Barbarians at the Gate</em>&nbsp;and now a Bloomberg reporter who studied the Lehman leadership, told us, “The few people on the Lehman board who actually had relevant experience were kind of like an all-star team from the 1980s back for an old-timers game in which they weren’t even up on the new rules and equipment. Fuld selected them because he didn’t want to be challenged by anyone. Most of the top executives didn’t understand the risks they were taking, so can you imagine a septuagenarian sitting in the boardroom getting a PowerPoint presentation on synthetic CDOs and credit default swaps?”</p><em>Barbarians at the Gate</em><p>In a conference call announcing Lehman’s 2008 third-quarter loss of $3.9 billion, Fuld told analysts, “I must say the board’s been wonderfully supportive.” The next day the board approved $100 million in payouts to five executives. Four days later the 159-year-old company declared the largest bankruptcy in U.S. history. Lehman’s shareholders, represented by the board, lost over $45 billion.</p><p>Says a former senior investment banker who now serves as a director for several S&amp;P 500 companies: “The Lehman board was a joke and a disgrace. Asleep at the switch doesn’t begin to describe it.”</p><p><strong>Inherent Conflicts of Interest</strong><br>The Lehman disaster was not an isolated instance of hubris, incompetence, and negligence by a corporate board. The board at Merrill Lynch was so disconnected from the company that when shareholders met in December 2008 to approve the company’s sale to Bank of America — after five straight quarterly losses totaling $24 billion — not a single one of the nine non-executive Merrill directors even attended the meeting.</p><strong>Inherent Conflicts of Interest</strong><br><p>Stories of boards and CEOs failing to do their jobs on behalf of shareholders can also be told about AIG, Bank of America, Bear Stearns, Citigroup, Countrywide, Fannie Mae, Sovereign Bank, Wachovia, Washington Mutual, and many other companies directly involved in the recent financial meltdown, as well as many firms outside of finance whose governance-related troubles came home to roost in the recession.</p><p>On behalf of shareholders, boards’ specific duties are to choose and, when necessary, replace the chief executive officer of the company; evaluate the performance of senior managers; set executive compensation; approve key strategic and financial decisions; nominate candidates for shareholders to elect as directors; and ensure the company’s integrity, sustainability, and compliance with laws and regulations as it tries to grow.</p><p>Ideally, a board of directors is informed, active, and offers sound advice while maintaining a collegial but challenging relationship with the company’s CEO. In reality, some 61 percent of CEOs at our largest companies also serve as board chairman — an inherent conflict of interest that leaves board members dependent on the person they’re supposed to supervise for compensation, information, perks, committee assignments, and, often, their very presence at the table.</p><p><strong>More Regulations Not the Answer</strong><br>America’s most successful investor, Warren Buffett, has long been a critic of public company boards. His 2002 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, for example, asked, “Why have intelligent and decent directors failed so miserably?” No doubt he had the spectacular collapses at Enron and WorldCom in mind.</p><strong>More Regulations Not the Answer</strong><br><p>After every scandal there tends to be a call for board reform, followed by cleanup efforts that focus on the perceived cause of the most recent crash. These efforts have ignored the enduring cultural problems of CEO-board collusive relationships and the lack of shareholder power. The result is the imposition of ineffective, costly, or counter-productive legal and structural requirements that boards and executives quickly find ways around, with the assistance of lawyers, accountants, lobbyists, and bankers. Billions of shareholders’ dollars are spent to forestall or circumvent more effective reforms. Even worse, people are lulled into a false sense of security that the problem has been addressed, investors return to the markets, and the cycle continues. In light of this poor regulatory track record, we believe government-mandated reforms and more regulation alone cannot solve the current crisis of corporate leadership.</p><p>Bill George, the former CEO and chairman of Medtronic, now a Professor of Management Practice at HBS who serves on the boards of ExxonMobil and Goldman Sachs, told a forum of directors in 2008, “Serving on a board is about one thing: It’s about responsibility for the preservation and growth of the enterprise. If you can’t pass that test, you can’t blame it on the CEO; you can’t blame it on your fellow directors. You have to look at yourself in the mirror.”</p><p><strong>Teflon Corporate Boards</strong><br>Ironically, in the reckoning after the most recent financial crisis, boards of directors have largely escaped blame — because to blame them, investors would have to know who they are. Their names appear on the generic, straight-to-the-wastebasket proxy forms that shareholders receive. But despite recent improvements that have increased shareholders’ voices in governance, a levelheaded observer like former SEC chairman William Donaldson (MBA ’58) has compared the current system of choosing directors to “the old Soviet-style elections” in which shareholders’ real choice is to vote for anointed nominees, abstain, or sell the stock. Of all the nominees put forward by boards, 99.7 percent win election.</p><strong>Teflon Corporate Boards</strong><br><p>Also, thanks to the Delaware courts’ generous interpretation of the business judgment rule, directors must have “knowingly and completely failed to undertake their responsibilities” or had “an actual intent to do harm” — a standard that has let thousands of failed boards off the hook over the years.</p><p>While there’s no downside for bad directors, the system also makes it difficult for good directors to excel. Post-Enron reforms such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and new stock exchange requirements that call for more independent directors and periodic board sessions without the CEO, have brought unintended consequences. Too often, well-intentioned boards are now compelled to focus on protective legal processes and box-checking exercises rather than on formulating company strategy, identifying risks, and evaluating executive performance.</p><p>The increasing time commitment required of board members, the complexity of contemporary business problems, the inherent conflicts between monitoring and advisory responsibilities, and the frustration of serving in a role under intense scrutiny in a brutal economic environment have made the job unattractive to many capable people and difficult for anyone to discharge effectively. Speaking at&nbsp;<em>Directorship</em>&nbsp;magazine’s annual conference in December 2008, Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, told several hundred prominent board members that he couldn’t conceive of how they might do their jobs successfully: “I get very nervous about being held responsible for things that I don’t have complete control of. The notion that there would be very intelligent people doing very complicated things six and a half days a week, and I would come in on a periodic basis and tell them how to do it better, I don’t understand how you do that.”</p><em>Directorship</em><p>Our anachronistic board structure, dating back to the 18th century, is not up to 21st-century demands, for investors or for directors themselves.</p><p><strong>Ideas for Fundamental Reforms</strong><br>Boards are not going to disappear. Nor, despite their many flaws, should they. They remain the only practical way for shareholders to be represented within companies. With developments such as the recent Supreme Court decision allowing companies to spend more freely on political campaigns, the importance of corporate governance is likely to grow. Many boards are effective, and even on flawed boards exclusivity is a form of opportunity. With such a small group around the table, a single talented and committed director can turn an entire company on its axis.</p><strong>Ideas for Fundamental Reforms</strong><br><p>Still, the system is in need of fundamental change. Shareholders have a part to play. They must shed their apathy and ignorance and demand higher standards of performance from the CEOs, boards, gatekeepers, and financial institutions they pay to grow their investments. Public outrage over scandals or excessive executive compensation is ephemeral. It must be channeled to demand a transformation in how our companies are governed.</p><p>Congress can help, too, by mandating the long-overdue split between the roles of chairman and CEO. The CEO works for the board, not the other way around; but the continuation of combined roles creates an insurmountable imbalance of power. Lead directors have served as a half-step toward a solution, but often the CEO dominates the lead director appointment, the board’s agenda, and the flow of information. Proposals to separate the chairman and CEO posts only when a new CEO takes office have not worked because as long as other CEOs remain chairmen, there is the appearance of a demotion and loss of face. The change should be mandated by law.</p><p>Ultimately, though, you can’t regulate your way to strong leadership or good character any more than you can legislate morality. Companies and their shareholders have to want to change their boards — and to help make board members perform better.</p><p>Formal certification of all directors is an unworkable idea, but because the boardroom environment is more challenging than ever, the learning needs of directors have grown. There currently exists a hodgepodge of optional director training programs at universities, associations, and for-profits, but they are not consistent or sufficiently rigorous.</p><p>A consortium of the major business schools should create a formal and permanent directors’ institute with East and West Coast campuses. Its purpose would be to ensure that directors are intensively trained for initial board service and then remain current on business, strategic, legal, financial, regulatory, and accounting developments, as well as techniques for improving group process — like a Six Sigma Black Belt for directors. A fee of one one-hundredth of one cent per share on the current volume of the U.S. stock exchanges would yield about $50 million annually — more than enough to fund such directors’ training.</p><p>All the postmortems of the current collapse show people making unconscious or malfeasant choices. At the MBA level, it’s encouraging that HBS and other leading business schools are reexamining their curricula and placing a new emphasis on corporate responsibility. They should more deeply integrate technical and behavioral finance, organizational behavior, and ethics to better prepare future leaders — and also focus more cases on the proper role of boards.</p><p>Once directors are properly trained, it is crucial that they perform active service, but not for too long. Numerous countries, including the United Kingdom, force turnover of their independent directors after nine years. That’s a policy that should be adopted here. The loss of experience would be outweighed by reduced cronyism. If a director were truly indispensable, he or she could remain on the board but would no longer be considered independent and thus would be ineligible to serve on key committees.</p><p>Finally, companies must only nominate directors willing to put skin in the game. Shareholders deserve directors who think like owners and not like reactive defenders of management. Exchange rules should set up minimum requirements for equity ownership by directors, and bylaws should require them. The “play money” distributed in the form of stock options and gifts of restricted stock should not be included. Directors should have a meaningful percentage of their net worth invested in companies they serve, something along the lines of 3 to 6 percent, depending on the number of directorships they hold. And they should have holding period requirements that extend beyond their tenure on the board.</p><p>Imagine if, in the years before the financial crisis, boards had asked tough questions; second-guessed shortsighted strategies; and aligned risk, compensation, and performance. What if they had been true stewards of other people’s money? Surely, they would have reduced the incalculable financial devastation and human suffering that has followed.</p><p>We still don’t truly know how far we have moved from that disaster and whether it may soon be repeated on a more catastrophic scale. If we are ever going to make it to safety, it’s well past time for corporate boards to remember whom they truly serve and to step up and do their jobs.</p>"

Can you give an example  of a leader in the health care industry that is exemplifying True North?</strong><p>BG: One person who I served with on a board, and who recently stepped  down from his company, is Dan Vasella, CEO of Novartis, a Swiss  pharmaceutical company.  Novartis has a large generics business, they’ve  got the H1N1 vaccine and a large vaccine business, and they have a  consumer health business.  But the significant thing about Dan is that  he recognizes all corporations exist first to serve society.  If a  corporation doesn’t serve society by using its strengths, then in the  end it will have very difficult times.</p><p>If a corporation focuses only on maximizing shareholder value, as  Milton Friedman erroneously told us, eventually a corporation will  probably implode or self destruct—as General Motors did, and as Sears  Roebuck did—by focusing entirely on shareholder value and not  recognizing their job to serve the customer.  But, I think part of that  serving the customer is a societal concern.  For example, Vasella also  recognizes that not all patients have the wherewithal to pay, so  Novartis has also had a big focus on malaria in Africa where they are  giving away a drug called Coartem.</p><p>They also recognize the need to collaborate with NGOs and to  collaborate with governments, because Novartis can not deliver the drug  to Africa by itself.  So it’s a whole team effort, it’s a whole  collaboration and I think Dan Vasella recognizes that.</p><p><strong>E: Are there any compliance/ethics risk areas in the  healthcare industry that you see requiring particular focus from leaders  in that industry? How can leaders prevent those risks within those  companies?</strong></p><strong>E: Are there any compliance/ethics risk areas in the  healthcare industry that you see requiring particular focus from leaders  in that industry? How can leaders prevent those risks within those  companies?</strong><p>BG: If you start with, broadly speaking, the provider side of  healthcare, we have a huge issue and the incentives are all  misaligned—even through this latest healthcare reform bill which is yet  to be signed but will be by the time of your publication.  The current  incentives are for doing more procedures, giving more tests, seeing more  people and not for keeping people healthy.  And so I think there is a  huge ethical dilemma in healthcare in general.</p><p>But so how do we get to a healthcare system designed to keep people  healthy, and not just treat them while they’re sick? That gets to the  really tough ethical question of lifestyle.  Seventy percent of all  healthcare costs emanate from people’s inappropriate lifestyles.   Obesity is number one and is the most rapidly growing disease.  Of  course, you don’t hear it as obesity you hear it as type two diabetes.   So I think there is a real ethical question in terms of providers of  health care.</p><p>In terms of the suppliers—the pharmaceutical and medical technology  companies—it’s hard to think over the long term that companies are going  to be successful selling into an unhealthy system.  So I think it is  incumbent upon the pharmaceutical, biotech and medical technology  companies to start trying to create a healthy system.</p><p>Certainly insurance companies are a big contributor to an unhealthy  system.  They are not helpful right now.  We need insurance companies to  start insuring companies and people for staying well, rather than just  insuring them for staying sick.  We have to get upstream of the problem.   I don’t see a lot being done right now.</p><p>We need to look at the whole person, and that’s what my wife is  talking about with the [George Family] Foundation.  There are huge  mind-body connections.  Placebo effects are real.  It’s a positive  thing, even though most look at it as a negative thing.  If you think  you’re going to be healthy your odds are greater.  How do we create that  kind of sense of well being and how do we keep the commitment on people  to exercise and diet to stay healthy and all those things?</p><p>That’s what John Mackey in Whole Foods is trying to do.  But who is  doing that in the healthcare industry?  Who is taking the lead on that  and really trying to make a difference in people’s health?  We did a lot  of things in Medtronic but Medtronic is just one player.  What are  other companies doing to make a difference in terms of the health of  their employees?  I think it’s essential that healthcare companies take a  lead and create a healthier health care system.  That means a healthier  population, not just promoting their own products, drugs or insurance  plans.</p><p><strong>E: Now speaking more broadly than just the healthcare  industry in particular, you have said that the younger generation (i.e.  those under 45 or so) should take over because they are showing stronger  leadership and more focus on their True North.  Can you expand on the  qualities that you see in that younger generation?</strong></p><strong>E: Now speaking more broadly than just the healthcare  industry in particular, you have said that the younger generation (i.e.  those under 45 or so) should take over because they are showing stronger  leadership and more focus on their True North.  Can you expand on the  qualities that you see in that younger generation?</strong><p>BG: I think we are going through a massive generational change in  leadership.  The baby boomers were raised in an era of coming out of two  world wars and a depression that their parents experienced. Even though  we didn’t live through it, our parents’ experience was very real to us.   From that we developed this “command and control” mentality of how to  run an organization.</p><p>The great corporations of the world in the 1950’s and 60’s were  command and control organizations.  With this new century, that concept  of command and control has totally gone out because employees today are  knowledge workers, they have options and they don’t stay around. But  most importantly they’re looking for meaning, not just money.  I think  today’s great leaders will know how to empower people, all of us, to  step up and lead.  So it’s not a command and control type situation, and  it’s not exerting power over the people, it’s aligning people over  mission and values, and getting them to step up and lead, and getting  them to recognize their job is to serve a certain customer first and not  the shareholder.</p><p>That’s what I think the younger generation, like I said those under  40 or under 45, really understands. I think particularly for my students  who are in their late 20’s, this is a great opportunity for them  because the global economic meltdown of 2008 and 2009 is like a crucible  experience for them in that they recognize that the way we were going  was headed for sheer destruction.  They have a chance to recover whereas  a lot of the older leaders of Wall Street are passing from the scene  and have no chance to recover.</p><p>I just read this new article called “Leadership’s Lost Decade.”  I  think this decade of 2000 to 2010 will go down as the lost decade of  leadership.  It started out with the collapse of the dot-coms, which  were the great hopes for the future.  We went from venture capitalists  starting up great companies like Intel, Google, Microsoft, Starbucks and  people like that, to trying to make money off of paper product.  People  thought they could quickly develop a business plan, take it to the  market, run an IPO and make a lot of money and it will all happen in  12-18 months.  It was all non-sense and it all collapsed.</p><p>That started the decade, and then right behind them came Enron,  Worldcom, Tyco and those with real ethical problems.  You look at the  people behind bars like the Bernie Ebbers and Jeff Skillings, but the  real addition there is that there were 200 real major companies like  Bristol-Myers and Xerox that had to restate their numbers by some 2 to 3  billion dollars in income because of ethical deviations, because of  inappropriate accounting which was driven by ethical considerations.</p><p>And of course we closed the decade with the financial meltdown of the  last two years. That really resulted, in my opinion, from Wall Street,  which had been pressing leaders for short term outcomes, actually  playing the short term game so much themselves that they self  destructed.  So you had great financial institutions like  Citigroup—which was the greatest bank in the world when I was growing  up—literally self destruct. They had to go to the government for a  combination of bailouts and loan guarantees of around $350 billion.   These financial institutions were all built like a house of cards and  someone pulled out the bottom card and the whole place collapsed.</p><p>I think in leadership terms that’s a huge wake up call.  I think that  in the advent of Enron and Sarbanes-Oxley corporate leaders got the  word.  Wall Street didn’t get the word.  Now you have a whole generation  of leaders passed from Wall Street, and the question is whether or not  the next generation will.  It’s still too soon to tell.  The jury is  out.</p><p><strong>E: Very often ethics and compliance problems are caused by  “Just One Employee,” i.e. one employee that makes a misguided decision  (such as bribing a foreign official or making false claims).  How can  leaders let people know that their Codes of Ethics and Compliance and  other ethical statements really do apply to the entire organization from  the top down, and do not just exist to satisfy regulatory requirements?</strong></p><strong>E: Very often ethics and compliance problems are caused by  “Just One Employee,” i.e. one employee that makes a misguided decision  (such as bribing a foreign official or making false claims).  How can  leaders let people know that their Codes of Ethics and Compliance and  other ethical statements really do apply to the entire organization from  the top down, and do not just exist to satisfy regulatory requirements?</strong><p>BG: Today’s leaders need to be directly engaged with their people all  around the world.  It takes an enormous amount of time.  They need to  be asking the questions, “How do we do business? What happens when you  get asked for favors?  What do you do?  How do you handle this?”  You  need to trust but verify.  You need to have a verification and  compliance system.</p><p>When there are any deviations, it should be a zero tolerance policy,  no second chance.  If you make mistakes, if you make poor business  decisions you should get a second chance.  If you have quality problems  you should get a second chance.  If you have operational problems you  should get a second chance.  On questions of company values there is no  second chance.  Everybody needs to know that and needs to be exposed.   You need to publicize that.  You need to not cover it up.</p><p>By the way, what’s really important in organizations is that you  can’t just blame people at the lowest levels.  You have to really look  at the whole chain of command.  That was Shell’s problem in Nigeria.   They didn’t look at everyone.  You can’t just blame the low level  people, you have got to look at what the management is doing and saying  because it’s there, too.</p><p>I felt that responsibility everyday.  We had ethical violations at  Medtronic.  I had to fire the head of Europe.  I had to fire the head of  Japan.  I had to fire the head of China.  It was very embarrassing for  me that it took so long to clean it up, but we went right at it and we  finally got the message across that this is the way we do business.</p><p>Ed Breen did a very good job cleaning up Tyco.  I don’t have as high  regard for Dennis Koslowski because it was kind of anything goes in his  era.  But, I think Breen has sent a clear message, “this is how you do  business.”  Just like Anne Mulcahy did at Xerox.  There were some  ethical questions there and she did a really good job cleaning things  up.</p><p>So I think we need to vet, not just criticize, people that are  violating ethical standards but we also need to hold up the leaders that  really do want to make a difference.</p><p><strong>E: In 7 Lessons, you have a lesson titled, “Don’t be Atlas.”   In that lesson you mention it’s good for leaders to have an external  team that can help you get through a crisis.  Can you expand a bit on  your own external team and how they have helped you get through crisis?</strong></p><strong>E: In 7 Lessons, you have a lesson titled, “Don’t be Atlas.”   In that lesson you mention it’s good for leaders to have an external  team that can help you get through a crisis.

That person for me is my wife, Penny.  If I get too high on  myself she’ll pull me back down and if I get really down she’ll give me a  practical view of things.  She’s just great and extremely helpful.  I  also have a men’s group that I meet with every Wednesday morning and we  talk about really important issues in life.  When you have challenges  you can talk to them. And when I have tough questions I have three or  four mentors like Warren Bennis and David Gergen that I can call up and  solicit their advice and counsel.</p><p>That’s extremely helpful to have because inside an organization it is  very easy to fall into a group think mentality.  You tend to all talk  about the same issue and you tend to think about them the same way.   It’s really important to have outside exposure.  When you have that  external team they can help you bring perspective on things and tell  you, “It’s not that bad.”</p><p><strong>E: Broadly speaking, what are you most hopeful about with today’s leaders?</strong></p><strong>E: Broadly speaking, what are you most hopeful about with today’s leaders?</strong><p>BG: I’m most hopeful about the younger leaders stepping up and taking  over.  I hope that this generational change in leadership will come  quickly and I hope it will give younger people an opportunity to step up  and lead major organizations as well as start ups and new  organizations.  I’m most hopeful about the new leaders that have been  appointed in the last three or four years from large corporations and  small corporations.  I think you’ve seen a remarkable job.  I’m hopeful  we can get a whole new generation that will step up and lead with a  higher sense of ethics and values, not just for its own sake but for  recognizing that’s the best way to build an organization and the right  way to sustain success.</p>"

He doesn’t pull punches and names names.</span><em>7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis</em><p>But don’t stop at the introduction.</p><p>Bill George, &nbsp;a professor of management practice at Harvard Business School, teaches a course on leadership which is based on his own executive experience in the real world of business. As the former chief executive of Medtronic, he boasts a spectacular track record and has been named one of the top 25 business leaders of the past 25 years by PBS. His other awards and recognition speak to his long and varied career.</p><p>Test of leadership</p><p>It’s in the introduction that Bill George writes that, “There is nothing quite like a crisis to test your leadership. It will make or break you as a leader.” He then outlines a variety of crises to take the reader through his 7 Lessons. While most of us will never operate in the executive leagues where George operated, the lessons apply to any business leader.</p><p>For example, in lesson one, Face Reality, George writes that “leaders often go into denial about the urgency and severity of the challenges they’re facing.” When was the last time you went into denial in terms of the challenges of your business or your life?</p><p>Using a variety of companies that were in crisis, George shares the experiences of leaders who tackled crises and won, even after being in denial of the situation. For example, he outlines how Warren Buffet, when he stepped in to steer Salomon Brothers to safety in the 1990s, demonstrated what courageous leaders do, even when their personal credibility is on the line.</p><p>I was impressed, while reading&nbsp;<em>7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis</em>, by George’s clear and concise writing style as he detailed corporate challenges, infighting, and victories. The story ins easy to follow; it is even easier to accept the lesson each exemplifies. You actually begin to visualize leaders in crisis.</p><em>7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis</em><p>George points out the dangers of leaders who stay in their office towers and who never have the benefit of using all their senses – touch, smell, sound, sight, and hearing – that trigger their emotions and their intuition. He tells of his own experiences of wandering through factories and labs to find out what was really happening in his organization, which led to his successful management career.</p><p>In lesson three, Dig Deep, George offers leaders the advice of trusting the people they work with, but also always verifying any information through their first-hand impressions from the marketplace or people working in labs or on the production lines. George provides examples of leaders who got into trouble because they never verified the information they were being given.</p><p>In lesson, Get Ready for the Long Haul, there is a brilliant piece of information relating to reinventing your leadership. Pretend you were fired and then think: what would I do if I were my replacement? How many leaders could truly walk into their office with a totally new set of eyes and change how the company operates? George gives examples of leaders who did.</p><p>Another aspect I liked about this book is George’s ability to show that business is not just about the bottom line. In fact, the author makes a point about how bottom-line mentality helped create the recent financial crisis. His argument is compelling and, based on the examples he gives, hard to refute.</p><p>All about values</p><p>Lesson six tells leaders how to cope with being in the spotlight and how it’s possible to be visible and accountable by being true to your values. This will be hard for some executives, as exemplified by the recent financial crisis in which it appears many either didn’t have values or certainly didn’t stick to them. When it comes to dealing with the media in such situations, George points out “The media will treat you right, if you’re being open and honest.”</p><p>Lesson seven, Go on Offence, Focus on Winning Now, examines the other half of leading in crisis, which is to go on the offence and focus on winning, not just getting through the crisis. George suggests that true leaders can reshape the market. He says it requires a clear vision of what future markets will look like and a focused strategy to reshape them, after which you need to move aggressively to put your strategy into action</p><p><em>7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis</em>&nbsp;is 127 pages of pure content. Unlike many business books, the information is out front and easily understood. The book is an easy read and entertaining. It’s also one of the books I’ll be returning to time and time again.</p><em>7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis</em><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Troy Media</p><p>Garth Roberts is a Leadership Coach and Trainer</p><p>&nbsp;</p>"

      "<p>During the last half of the 20th century, business leadership became an elite profession, dominated by managers who ruled their enterprises from the top down. Influenced by two World Wars and the Depression, organizational hierarchies were structured along military lines, with multi-layered structures to establish control through rules and processes. People climbed the ranks in search of power, status, money and perquisites, as described in William H. Whyte’s 1956 classic,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812218191/\">The Organization Man</a></em>, and Sloan Wilson’s 1955 novel,&nbsp;<em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_Gray_Flannel_Suit\">The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</a></em>.</p><em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812218191/\">The Organization Man</a></em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0812218191/\">The Organization Man</a><em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_Gray_Flannel_Suit\">The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</a></em><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_in_the_Gray_Flannel_Suit\">The Man in the Gray Flannel Suit</a><p>In the last quarter of the twentieth century the stock market became increasingly short-term, causing corporate leaders to concentrate on quarterly earnings, often to the exclusion of long-term growth. In the past decade it all blew up, from the ethical scandals exposed by Enron and WorldCom to the Wall Street meltdown. As a result, people lost trust in business leaders to build sustainable institutions instead of serving themselves and short-term shareholders.</p><p>What happened? The hierarchical model simply doesn’t work anymore. The craftsman-apprentice model has been replaced by learning organizations, filled with knowledge workers who don’t respond to “top down” leadership. Seeking opportunities to lead, young people are unwilling to spend ten years waiting in line. Most important, people are searching for genuine satisfaction and meaning from their work, not just money. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.medtronic.com/about-medtronic/index.htm\">Medtronic’s&nbsp;</a>38,000 employees are motivated by the company’s mission of “restoring people to full life and health.”</p><a href=\"http://www.medtronic.com/about-medtronic/index.htm\">Medtronic’s&nbsp;</a><p>In response to these changes, a new generation of leaders is reshaping the best-led global companies. Authentic leaders focused on customers are replacing hierarchical leaders that focus on serving short-term shareholders. Typical of these leaders is Unilever CEO Paul Polman,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fa865f42-3ff3-11df-8d23-00144feabdc0.html\">who recently told the Financial Times</a>, “I don’t work for the shareholder. I work for consumers and my customers.”</p><a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/fa865f42-3ff3-11df-8d23-00144feabdc0.html\">who recently told the Financial Times</a><p>In the 21st century the most successful leaders will focus on sustaining superior performance by aligning people around mission and values and empowering leaders at all levels, while concentrating on serving customers and collaborating throughout the organization.</p><p><strong>Aligning</strong>: The leader’s most difficult task is to align people around the organization’s mission and shared values, which is far more challenging than making short-term numbers. Gaining alignment is especially difficult in far-flung global organizations where local employees may be more loyal to native cultures than their employers, especially regarding business practices.</p><strong>Aligning</strong><p>Traditional leaders thought they could solve this problem with rulebooks, training programs and compliance systems, and were shocked when people deviated. Aligned employees commit to the mission and values of the organization, and want to be part of something greater than themselves. Johnson &amp; Johnson is a classic case of an aligned organization that uses its famed&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.jnj.com/connect/about-jnj/jnj-credo/\">Credo&nbsp;</a>to guide global employees in their actions.</p><a href=\"http://www.jnj.com/connect/about-jnj/jnj-credo/\">Credo&nbsp;</a><p><strong>Empowering</strong>: Hierarchical leaders delegate limited amounts of power in order to retain control. In contrast, 21st century leaders empower leaders at all levels, combined with sophisticated accountability systems to ensure commitments are met.</p><strong>Empowering</strong><p>Front-line leaders without direct reports are especially needed. Here’s an empowered leader who sets standards of excellence for other employees that I met at Medtronic’s heart valve facility. A Laotian immigrant, she told me, “I make heart valves that save people’s life. I do my own quality control, because if one of the valves I make fails, someone will die. At Medtronic 99.9 percent quality is very good, but I couldn’t live with causing someone’s death. My satisfaction comes from the 5,000 people alive today because of heart valves I made.”</p><p><strong>Serving</strong>: As Polman points out, the leader’s first obligation is not to shareholders, but rather to customers. CEOs who spend too much time listening to Wall Street risk ignoring their most important stakeholder — their customers. Any organization that doesn’t provide its customers with superior value relative to competitors will find itself going out of business. Employees are much more motivated by serving customers than they are by getting stock prices up, and that’s what leads to innovation and superior customer service. Satisfied customers and motivated employees are key to sustaining revenue growth and, ultimately, shareholder value.</p><strong>Serving</strong><p><strong>Collaborating</strong>: The challenges businesses face these days are too complex to be solved by individuals or even single organizations. Collaboration — within the organization and with customers, suppliers, and even competitors — is required to achieve lasting solutions. Leaders must foster this collaborative spirit, eliminating internal politics and focusing on internal cooperation. After becoming CEO of IBM, Sam Palmisano transformed IBM’s long-standing bureaucracy into an “integrated global network,” shifting to “<a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/ibm/values/us/\">leading by values</a>” and breaking down silos that kept people from collaborating.</p><strong>Collaborating</strong><a href=\"http://www.ibm.com/ibm/values/us/\">leading by values</a><p>The ultimate measure of effectiveness for leaders is the ability to sustain superior results over an extended period of time. Organizations filled with aligned, empowered and collaborative employees focused on serving customers will outperform hierarchical organizations every time. Top-down leaders may achieve near-term results, but only&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hbr.org/2007/02/discovering-your-authentic-leadership/ar/1\">authentic leaders&nbsp;</a>can galvanize the entire organization to sustain long-term performance.</p><a href=\"http://hbr.org/2007/02/discovering-your-authentic-leadership/ar/1\">authentic leaders&nbsp;</a><p>We need them to rebuild the trust that has been lost in capitalism.</p><p><em>(Editor’s note: This post is part of a six-week blog series by <a href=\"https://hbr.org/\">Harvard Business Review</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blogs.hbr.org/imagining-the-future-of-leadership/\">how leadership might look in the future</a>.

The more  relevant figure of “underemployed” indicates that more than 26 million  Americans are out of full-time work, or 17.5 percent of the workforce.  That figure includes the unemployed who have given up looking and  part-time workers seeking full-time jobs.</p><p>While the government’s monthly reports indicate the economy is  recovering, jobs are not. Economists keep assuring us that jobs aren’t  really a problem because hiring is a lagging indicator. What’s wrong  with this picture?</p><p>Since they base their forecasts on previous recessions, economists  have failed to recognize the United States is mired in a structural jobs  crisis that won’t get better anytime soon. Like it or not, we are  competing in a global labor market and steadily losing the competition.  No amount of short-term actions or protectionist behavior will reverse  this sea change.</p><p>For 10 years this shift was masked by overstimulating consumer  spending through excessive debt levels, mortgages for just about anyone,  and easy money. All that came crashing down in 2008 when financial  markets collapsed, and the Great Recession took hold.</p><p>Coming out of a crisis, markets never look the same again. Large  companies are steadily shifting jobs overseas to take advantage of the  global labor market. Since developing markets are recovering much faster  than developed economies of the United States, Europe and Japan, the  global giants are expanding their operations in these countries. IBM,  for example, has grown its operations in India from 15,000 to 100,000  employees in the past five years.</p><p>Historically, U.S. small employers have accounted for 70 percent of  new jobs. These days they are reluctant to hire because of increasing  costs and health care mandates, so they use part-time and temporary  workers instead. That leaves three sectors free to grow: government,  education and health care — all of which are funded directly or  indirectly with taxpayer dollars.</p><p>The $15 billion jobs bill only scratches the surface. As an employer,  would a $1,000 credit cause you to hire an employee costing $50,000 per  year? The only employers taking advantage of this bill are those  planning to hire anyway.</p><p><strong>Better in Minnesota</strong></p><strong>Better in Minnesota</strong><p>In Minnesota things are considerably better: core unemployment is  running 7.3 percent and 72.5 percent of Minnesota’s working-age citizens  have jobs, vs. 64.8 percent nationally. The diversity of Minnesota’s  economy is helping us through these broader problems, as only 11 percent  of employees work in manufacturing, the hardest-hit sector. But we  can’t be complacent as unemployment roles have tripled to 216,000 in the  past decade.</p><p>Is there a way out of this dilemma? Yes, but it won’t be a quick fix.  Long-term structural problems require long-term solutions. Sustainable  jobs are created by innovation, new companies and small businesses. A  recent study by the Kaufmann Foundation demonstrated that all 40 million  of the net new jobs between 1980 and 2005 came from companies less than  five years old.</p><p>During the last quarter century Minnesota’s economic strength and the  source of new jobs have sprung from the creativity, ingenuity and  entrepreneurship combined with the solid values and dedication of our  people.</p><p>Medtronic is an example. When I joined the company in 1989, it  employed 4,500 people worldwide, 75 percent in the United States. Since  then, Medtronic has dramatically expanded its business globally and its  overseas factories. Today the company has 38,000 people, but the ratio  hasn’t changed: 75 percent of employees are still based in the United  States. During this time Minnesota has become the center of the medical  technology business, as St. Jude and Boston Scientific expanded here,  along with hundreds of recent start-ups growing into important sources  of medical innovation.</p><p>The stories of Target and Best Buy are even more dramatic.  Twenty-five years ago both were just small, experimental ideas. As  Dayton-Hudson morphed into Target, the company just kept growing. Today  Target has 400,000 employees — 50,000 in Minnesota and western  Wisconsin — and revenue of $65 billion. From a single store, Best Buy  has grown dramatically to 155,000 employees and $49 billion in revenue.</p><p>How can Minnesota keep generating new jobs? The two primary job  sources will be the expansion of hometown companies and the creation of  an environment that fosters innovation and spawns new companies.</p><p>Minneapolis-St. Paul is a headquarters town, home to 19 Fortune 500  companies ranging from U.S. Bancorp and Ameriprise to General Mills, 3M  and UnitedHealth Group. Minnesota also boasts large health care  nonprofits such as the Mayo Clinic and Allina Health Systems.</p><p>Food giant Cargill Inc. and hospitality leader Carlson Companies are also large employers that are privately held.</p><p>As these companies expand globally, they continue to create excellent jobs locally.</p><p><strong>Tending to quality</strong></p><strong>Tending to quality</strong><p>That’s even true for two giants that moved their headquarters when  they merged: Wells Fargo (formerly Norwest Corp.) and Delta (formerly  Northwest Airlines). Wells Fargo has added 6,000 jobs in Minnesota since  the merger. In contrast, when Honeywell sold to AlliedSignal (now  Honeywell International) and moved to New Jersey, 20,000 Minnesotans  lost their jobs.</p><p>Furthermore, Minnesota needs to foster the spawning of new companies  and the building of emerging companies into the thriving giants of the  future. While it’s true that 70 percent of new jobs come from small  businesses, often these companies are the suppliers and service  providers for the giants.</p><p>To foster the growth of Fortune 500 companies and start-ups alike,  Minnesota needs to enhance a business-friendly environment and the  quality of life that attracts innovators and entrepreneurs. Here are  some ideas to make this happen:</p><p>•Every innovative center has a strong technical university at its  core: Stanford in Northern California, MIT and Harvard in Cambridge,  Georgia Tech in Atlanta, and the University of Texas in Austin. For  Minnesota to be a fountain of ideas and new companies, the University of  Minnesota not only must have a strong Institute of Technology, medical  school and business school, it also needs to improve its capacity to  commercialize research and incubate start-up companies.</p><p>•Business leaders need to work together to build Minnesota as a  center for innovation and creativity, not just look after the interests  of their own companies.</p><p>•The generous philanthropic arms of these companies, inspired by  Kenneth Dayton’s “5 percent club,” can expand their grants locally to  support a caring environment with high quality of life.</p><p>•A more-positive, less-suspicious relationship between state  government and the state’s leading companies must be forged. Minnesota  companies aren’t looking for subsidies, handouts or bailouts. But they  do require business-friendly policies that enable local companies to  prosper and attract and retain the highest-quality leadership and  workers.</p><p>•Improve our K-12 public education system, especially in math and science.</p><p>•Finally, we cannot underestimate the importance of the intangible  “quality of life” that makes Minnesota attractive to the diverse people  required to build great global companies.</p><p>What makes up that quality of life? A vibrant arts scene, dynamic  professional sports franchises and lively downtown centers, as well as  beautiful lakes and parks plus strong religious and social support  communities.</p><p>This is a long and challenging list. It won’t create jobs overnight.  But its implementation will ensure that Minnesota continues to create a  growth environment for the 21st century that creates high-paying,  sustainable jobs and fosters successful companies, large and small  alike.</p><p>Bill George serves on the boards of Exxon Mobil and Goldman Sachs and  previously served on the Novartis and Target boards.

You will find lenders, venture  capitalists, and other financiers.</p><p>Even if you don’t know them personally, you should know who they are  and what they do—assuming, of course, that your world is the business  world, and that much of your business is done in Minnesota.</p><p>You will also see, on the pages that follow, entrepreneurs, including  individuals who have started several enterprises. There are builders—of  buildings and businesses—and thought leaders, public influencers, and  leaders of some of the not-for-profit enterprises that enrich your  world. Leaders of law and accounting firms also appear.</p><p>Who won’t you find? Prince, the musician—even though it would be  pitiable not to know his best productions. Twins catcher Joe Mauer, even  though your life will be improved by watching him work. You won’t find  Governor Tim Pawlenty, the novelist Vince Flynn, or the guy who played  Scrooge last year at the Guthrie Theater. We are presenting a roster of  people who occupy the business community. We left off professional  athletes, actors, entertainers, writers, artists, and all but a few  educators.</p><p>We also left out crooks—there’s no profile of Tom Petters—and elected  officials, although we hope we don’t have to remind you that you should  know the names of your representative in Congress, the mayor of the  city in which you live, and your state senator and representative. We  never considered including journalists.</p><p>Is 200 the right number of names? Well, sure it is. It highlights the fact that this is the 200th issue of <em>Twin Cities Business. </em></p><em>Twin Cities Business. </em><p>A better question is whether my associates and I—Gene Rebeck, Christa  Meland, Melissa Loth, Eric Kelsey—and a group of freelancers who  regularly contribute to the magazine have selected the right 200 people  to feature. And that’s where you come in.</p><p>As you know, part of the fun of reading a who’s who–style feature  like this is discovering names you might not have thought to include. As  we know—and please recognize that we do know this—there is also  frustration in finding that the people compiling the list have left off  someone who clearly, unequivocally should be on it.</p><p>So here’s what we’ll do: We’ll take your suggestions at  200plus@tcbmag.com. Send us the person’s name, title, company or  organization name, and no more than 150 words about why he or she is a  Minnesotan to know, and we’ll post your <span style=\"font-family:

      "<p><em>Originally Posted in the <a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/news/releases/georgeonhealthcare032310.html\">Harvard Business School Press</a> on March 23, 2010.</em></p><em>Originally Posted in the <a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/news/releases/georgeonhealthcare032310.html\">Harvard Business School Press</a> on March 23, 2010.</em><a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/news/releases/georgeonhealthcare032310.html\">Harvard Business School Press</a><p>The politicians’ chatter Sunday night during the historic House vote  on access to health insurance gave the impression that reform was done.  Speaker Nancy Pelosi called it an extension of the Declaration of  Independence, declaring, “health care is a right,” not a responsibility.  Republican leader John Boehner all but claimed it marked the end of  free enterprise.</p><p>Wrong on all counts.</p><p>Passing this bill is a momentous step in granting health care  insurance to 32 million Americans who lack access, something we can  finally take pride in. But it certainly doesn’t end the urgent need for  health care reform. Rather, this is the end of the beginning. Now the  hard work must begin in earnest.</p><p>The bill addresses only one of the four essential elements of health  care.  Beyond insuring the uninsured,cost, quality, and lifestyles are  not addressed.  Unless we focus on all four, we will continue to have a  dysfunctional system with unaffordable costs.</p><p>The bill does virtually nothing to constrain health care costs. It is  “paid for” with tax increases that take effect this year and projected  cuts in Medicare reimbursement, while delaying most benefits until 2014.  If we don’t get health care costs under control before then, the  Congressional Budget Office’s  projected deficit reductions will turn  into a trillion dollar increase the following decade.</p><p>Even the current round of Medicare cuts – over 20% for many  physicians and hospitals – is unsustainable, as politicians plan to  reverse them retroactively. If they don’t, many physicians and hospitals  will refuse to take Medicare patients, just as the Baby Boomers enter  the Medicare system. Last month Mayo Clinic in Scottsdale announced it  could not afford to accept Medicare patients. Longer term, this could  push the U.S. toward the British system of splitting into private and  public systems.</p><p>Nor does this bill constrain insurance premiums. Wellpoint’s 38%    rate hikes in California are going into effect, in spite of jawboning by  Health and Human Services Secretary Kathryn Sebelius. Expect other  insurers to follow. Can you think of any other product or service that  could pull off price increases of this magnitude?</p><p>The incentives for individuals and health care professionals in the  current system are perverse. There are no rewards for people who stay  well, and no penalties for leading unhealthy lifestyles or overusing the  system.  Nor are there incentives for doctors and hospitals to keep  people healthy and   prevent disease. In fact, studies have shown that  those physicians and facilities who do so find themselves losing income.</p><p>As a result, primary care physicians are forced to pack more office  visits into already crowded schedules, while spending less time with  each patient. Specialists are incentivized to do more procedures, even  when lower cost alternatives are available.  Hospitals are forced to  conduct more tests and get people out of the hospital before they are  ready.</p><p>We need to realign these incentives by rewarding people for healthy  lifestyles and taking more cost-effective approaches to their health.  Hospitals and physicians should be rewarded for keeping people well.</p><p>Experts like Donald Berwick, MD, of the Institute for Health  Improvement and Charles Denham, MD, of the Texas Medical Institute of  Technology have identified ten quality issues whose correction could  save billions of dollars. Managing chronic disease, which accounts for  75% percent of health care costs, in a systematic manner instead of as a  series of acute events, for example, could improve outcomes and quality  of life for millions of people, while dramatically lowering the cost of  care. Yet there is no national push to get this done.</p><p>It is estimated that lifestyle issues like unhealthy diets, smoking,  alcohol, lack of physical exercise, and unmanaged stress account for  more than half of all health care costs. Addressing these factors  requires a national movement for wellness and prevention, modeled after  the highly successful anti-smoking campaign; yet all this is virtually  ignored in the current legislation.  To motivate people to take  responsibility for their health and live healthy lives, there must be  rewards for those who do and penalties for those who don’t. On a local  level,   consumer-driven health plans and the integrated health movement  have had some success in this regard. Now these must be taken to scale  nationally.</p><p>This is a complex set of priorities to realize in a system already  under tremendous pressure. It is too complex to leave in the hands of  politicians who lack deep knowledge of health care and are swayed by  lobbyists. For these reasons it is likely that solutions will arise in  local communities before they are adopted nationally.  The process will  be long and difficult.But unless we begin immediately, the U.S. health  care system will make our country not only less healthy but less  competitive.</p><p>Now is the time for health care leaders locally and nationally to  step up to these challenges, and  bring about the whole package of  needed changes and improvements. Let’s get on with the hard work.</p><p><strong>About Harvard Business School:</strong><br> Founded in 1908 as part of Harvard University, <a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/\">Harvard Business School</a> is located on a 40-acre campus in Boston.

But access is only one element of the complex health  care equation.</p><p>Virtually overlooked at the federal level are three equally important  aspects of health care: cost, quality and personal responsibility.  Without addressing these essential areas, the health care crisis cannot  be resolved.</p><p>One lesson from the federal effort is that health care at the  national level is too complex to yield to a single comprehensive  solution. America’s health care needs are too diverse geographically to  devise a “one-size-fits-all” formula. Instead of waiting for Washington,  Minnesota’s health care leaders should seize the initiative and move  forward with the optimal health system for Minnesotans.</p><p><strong>State is national model</strong></p><strong>State is national model</strong><p>If you have a serious health problem, there is no better place to get  well than Minnesota. Our state is a model for the nation in health care  efficiency, quality, cost-effectiveness and integrated care. Yet we,  too, face a deepening health care crisis.</p><p>Before offering suggestions for transforming Minnesota health care,  let me share what I have learned in the last 20 years of examining  health care systems throughout the United States and comparing them to  countries around the globe:</p><p>•There is no organized health care system in this country. Instead, we have very fragmented and expensive sick care.</p><p>•Incentives in the reimbursement system drive higher usage, more  procedures and tests and lack a focus on wellness and prevention.</p><p>•Ever since the discovery of antibiotics to cure infectious disease,  we have searched for cures to chronic diseases. The breakthroughs in  medicine in recent decades — and there have been enormous advances —  have helped us get well and extended our lives, but haven’t eradicated  chronic diseases. Cancer research, for example, has produced treatments  that help millions of people. But there is still no universal cure for  cancer.</p><p>•Unhealthy lifestyles account for more than half of the cost of  health care. We label our problems as diabetes, alcoholism, heart  disease, cancer and back and joint disease. Yet in over half the cases  these diseases emanate from a lack of focus on wellness and prevention.</p><p>Living a healthy life starts with the responsibility each person has  to focus on wellness and disease prevention. Rather than waiting until  we get sick, we need a diverse team of health care providers to educate  and assist us in staying healthy.</p><p><strong>Personal responsibility</strong></p><strong>Personal responsibility</strong><p>When we get sick, we are responsible for getting and staying well,  with the full support of our health care team. They can help us on the  road to recovery, but we still have the responsibility to take the  necessary steps to avoid recurrence. For many people this represents a  major shift in outlook.</p><p>How do we make this happen in Minnesota?</p><p>First, we need a public awareness and education campaign to encourage  healthful lifestyles, modeled after the successful anti-smoking  campaigns. This campaign should be led by public health experts and  funded through public-private partnerships that include state funds.</p><div>\n<p>Second, we need to recognize that primary care and specialty care  have very different purposes and organize accordingly. The purpose of  primary care is wellness and prevention and treatment of acute disease.  These days people should not depend on a single physician to provide  care. Instead, they need a team of people to get well and stay well.</p>\n<p>Primary care needs to move away from costly one-to-one care by  physicians. Primary care teams should be led by physicians, who oversee  teams of nurses, nutritionists, health and fitness coaches,  stress-reduction experts and complementary practitioners. Their goal is  to keep people well, prevent illness and treat acute disease. Primary  care should be compensated for helping people stay well, not just for  procedures and tests.</p>\n<p>Lack of access to health care remains a serious problem driving up  health care costs. To address it, we should expand our community health  centers, where everyone can access teams of wellness, prevention and  primary care practitioners. Much of this care can be provided in groups  of people, rather than in individual sessions. Payment for these  services would be based on ability to pay, with state government  supplements for those who could not afford these services.</p>\n<p><strong>Specialty care</strong></p>\n<p>People who develop serious diseases need teams of specialists who are  expert in that disease. Specialty care should focus on the coordinated  management of chronic disease, instead of treating it as a series of  acute events. The specialists should be paid for managing people based  on outcomes, not just for doing surgery or procedures.</p>\n<p>The rapidly rising costs of chronic disease, which accounts for 75  percent of health care costs, could be dramatically reduced if patients  enrolled in chronic-disease management programs. Through these programs  specialty teams would help patients develop personalized health plans,  based on integrative medicine principles. These include the mind-body  connection, physical exercise, healthful eating and stress management  skills. These principles are key to both quality of life and preventing  disease from recurring.</p>\n<p>To cover the staggering cost of chronic disease, all Minnesotans  should have the opportunity to purchase catastrophic care insurance,  using statewide health insurance exchanges. Catastrophic coverage should  be based on low-premium, high-deductible plans that kick in when  individuals incur expenses beyond a pre-determined dollar amount, based  on their income level. Paperwork can be dramatically reduced with fully  electronic billing systems. Medtronic pioneered these plans a decade ago  with great success in terms of wellness and cost.</p>\n<p>Every legal resident of the state should be eligible for these plans,  regardless of preexisting conditions or employment status. For  individuals, the costs of catastrophic coverage would be deductible from  state taxes, with tax credits applied to those who lack adequate income  to afford the premiums. To help pay for this coverage, the tax-free  portion of employer-based plans would be limited to $10,000 for  individuals and $18,000 for families, with any excess treated as  ordinary income for state income taxes. Initially, catastrophic coverage  should be voluntary, with a firm future date set in which coverage  becomes mandatory, just like it is for automobile insurance.</p>\n<p>Minnesota has long been the national leader in health care.

After years of  decline, they can reestablish the preeminence of American-made autos if  they are wise at leading through this crisis.</p><p>In the past month Toyota has recalled almost 9 million vehicles—more  than the entire number it sold the past three years. The irony is that  Toyota gained significant market share in the past decade at the expense  of its American competitors by offering superior quality vehicles. Now  quality has become Toyota’s Achilles’ heel.</p><p>No doubt Toyota will regain some of its lost market share in the  short term, to the extent the automaker’s production systems can respond  by increasing production rates without incurring problems of their own.  The bigger question is, will Ford and GM be able to capitalize on this  opportunity for the long term?</p><p>I was with Whitacre when he initially learned that Toyota was  suspending sales of 57 percent of its autos sold in the United States.  He responded immediately by directing his executives to ramp-up  production as quickly as possible.</p><p>While Whitacre and Mulally maximize current sales, taking advantage  of this opportunity in the near term is not a long-term strategy. All  too often, both GM and Ford have squandered similar opportunities by  simply raising prices and profits, as they did during the three-year  import quotas in the mid-1980s. They must recognize that no matter how  wounded Toyota is in the short term by its quality problems, this  company is a very tough and able competitor that will move quickly to  revamp its quality and its product offerings.</p><p><strong>On the march</strong></p><strong>On the march</strong><p>GM and Ford need to move aggressively to secure their market share  gains by investing windfall profits to make their auto lineups more  competitive for the next decade. That means introducing new designs that  offer attractive features, improved fuel efficiency, and better  customer value along with superior quality. This will take enormous  effort, ingenuity, and discipline along with massive investments.</p><p>In this regard, Ford has the jump on GM. When Mulally was hired from  Boeing in 2006, Ford was in trouble. The company was stretched thin with  too many product lines spanning too many countries and appealing to too  few consumers. Mulally’s first act was to borrow $23.5 billion by  mortgaging the entire company to give Ford the runway necessary to  retool its aging lineup.</p><p>Mulally moved fast, trimming unpopular lines, cutting management  layers, and insisting on an R&amp;D overhaul that hurt short-term  profits. Having weathered the 2008 crisis without U.S. government  support, Ford has $23 billion in cash in the bank and a lineup of  eco-friendly automobiles to which U.S. consumers are gravitating.</p><p>GM only emerged from bankruptcy last July, when Whitacre was  installed by the Obama administration as its new board chair. Since that  time, he has acted decisively, removing Fritz Henderson as CEO and  assuming the mantle himself. Whitacre quickly reorganized the company  from top to bottom, cut out layers of middle management, initiated new  product development programs, and revamped GM’s international sales and  marketing. He also put himself on the firing line, publicly taking  ownership for GM’s turnaround and appearing in a series of  advertisements challenging consumers to compare GM autos with its  competitors.</p><p>Glimmers of Ford’s and GM’s potential shone brightly at the Detroit  Auto Show last month. Mulally showcased his new model range. Car experts  and reviewers alike agreed the new models revitalized Ford. Whitacre  also unveiled a new line of cars, admittedly trailing Ford, particularly  in hybrids. He boldly predicted GM would be profitable in 2010 and  would pay off its government loans.</p><p>January sales for Ford and GM jumped 24 percent and nearly 14  percent, respectively, year over year, in spite of high unemployment and  low consumer confidence.</p><p><strong>Chrysler falls further</strong></p><strong>Chrysler falls further</strong><p>In contrast, look at Chrysler and its new CEO, Sergio Marchionne. He  ambitiously projected that Chrysler would become profitable in 2010 on  an 18 percent increase in sales. Instead, Chrysler sales dropped 8  percent in January. Marchionne has not been aggressive in revamping  Chrysler vehicles, repositioning the company’s brand, or reorganizing  its beleaguered management. As a result, it is falling further behind  and missing this golden opportunity.</p><p>The last and perhaps most important lesson for leaders going through a  crisis is that they cannot just play defense by cutting costs and  waiting for the crisis to pass. They have to go on offense  simultaneously by transforming their organizations and investing heavily  in revamping their products and their marketing to focus on winning <em>now</em>.</p><em>now</em><p>That’s precisely what Mulally and Whitacre are doing. They may not be  automobile industry veterans, but they are highly competitive leaders,  skilled at winning in the marketplace. The American automobile industry  is a lot stronger today because of their decisive, visionary leadership.</p>"

(<em>Editor’s note: Toyoda has agreed to appear before a Congressional inquiry this week</em>.)  Meanwhile, he let serious product quality issues spiral out of control  by understating safety risks and product problems. This left the media,  politicians, and consumers to dictate the conversation, while Toyota  fumbled the responses.</p><em>Editor’s note: Toyoda has agreed to appear before a Congressional inquiry this week</em><p>Disingenuous quasi-apologies and disjointed plans for resolution have  been Toyota’s substitute for crisis response. As accounts pour in about  declining quality, the company parades out relatively unknown mid-level  managers to quell the firestorm.</p><p>It won’t work. “You live by the sword; you die by the sword.”  Toyota’s weapon of choice has always been quality, a competitive  advantage that prompted many Americans to stop buying GM and Ford  brands. Toyota can only regain its footing by transforming itself from  top to bottom to deliver the highest quality automobiles.</p><p>When terrorists laced Tylenol capsules with cyanide in the mid-1980s,  Johnson &amp; Johnson CEO Jim Burke understood his company credo  challenged him to put the needs of customers first. Although J&amp;J was  not responsible for these problems, Burke nevertheless recalled every  Tylenol product from the market.</p><p>This is not a crisis of faulty brakes and accelerators, but a  leadership crisis.  During Chrysler’s 1980s crisis, CEO Lee Iacocca took  charge, restoring consumer trust and prosperity. When General Motors  emerged from bankruptcy last summer, Chairman Ed Whitacre became the  trustworthy, determined face of the company’s comeback.</p><p>Toyota needs a credible leader with a strong, cohesive plan. Mr.  Toyoda is anything but. His uninspired words of optimism from Davos only  unnerved customers and U.S. regulators. Meanwhile, Ford and GM are  working hard to regain the market share they lost at Toyota’s expense.</p><p>How can Akio Toyoda get Toyota back on track?  I offer recommendations based on my recent book, <a href=\"../../../../../../page/7-lessons-for-leading-in-crisis\">7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis</a>.</p><a href=\"../../../../../../page/7-lessons-for-leading-in-crisis\">7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis</a><p>1: Face reality, starting with yourself. Faced with multiple reports  of accidents from sticking accelerators, Toyota blamed the problems on  stuck floor mats and panicky drivers. Instead, Toyota should acknowledge  that its vaunted quality system failed. CEO Toyoda should take personal  responsibility by saying that he pushed too hard for growth and  neglected quality. By admitting his errors, he gives every Toyota  employee permission to acknowledge mistakes and to get on with  correcting them, instead of denying reality.</p><p>2: Don’t be Atlas; get the world off your shoulders. Toyoda cannot  expect to solve problems of this magnitude himself. Instead, he needs a  crisis team reporting directly to him, working 24/7 to get problems  fixed—permanently. He also needs outside counsel, as he appears to be  listening only to insiders who are defensive about criticism. He should  add the world’s top quality experts to his fix-it team and listen  carefully to their advice.</p><p>3: Dig deep for the root cause.  When Toyota’s problems first  surfaced, the company blamed a symptom—loose floor mats—and exonerated  the accelerators. Instead, management should have required its best  engineers to get to the root cause of this problem and every other  quality problem being reported. This is basic engineering and quality  discipline.</p><p>4: Get ready for the long haul. These problems won’t just fade away.  In fact, they are likely to get worse before getting better. Just as the  seeds were sown over the past ten years by placing growth ahead of  customer concerns and quality, digging deep into problems will likely  uncover more quality concerns that will take years to resolve. Toyota  must invest heavily in corrective actions while its sales shrink and  profits implode, requiring major cash resources until its reputation can  be restored.</p><p>5: Never waste a good crisis. For all the pain Toyota is  experiencing, this crisis provides a unique opportunity to make  fundamental changes required to restore Toyota quality. The crisis is  melting away the denial and resistance that existed in recent years.  Employees are ready for new direction, and they are willing to make  radical changes to renew the company. With Toyoda’s leadership, Toyota  automobiles can be restored to the world’s highest quality.</p><p>6: You’re in the spotlight: follow True North. In a crisis, people  insist on hearing from the leader. Akio Toyoda can’t send out public  relations specialists or his American executives to explain what  happened. Having lost sight of his company’s True North—its values and  principles—Toyoda must come out of hiding, take personal responsibility,  and subject himself to intense questioning by regulators and the media.  Then he should make a personal commitment to every Toyota customer to  repair the damage, including buying back defective cars.</p><p>7: Go on offense; focus on winning now. Coming out of this crisis,  the market will never look the same. GM and Ford are rapidly regaining  market share, while the confidence of Toyota’s loyal customers is badly  shaken. Toyota cannot wait until all its quality problems are resolved.  It must play defense and offense simultaneously. To win, Toyota has to  offer advanced features and superior quality, better value for  consumers, greater safety, and improved fuel efficiency.</p><p>This is a challenging menu, and this crisis is the true test of Akio  Toyoda’s leadership. Is Toyota up to these challenges? I believe this is  a great company that will resurrect its reputation and restore its  leadership.</p>"

But this week brings a rare  catch — the head of a foreign company.</p><p>Toyota President Akio Toyoda will appear Wednesday in front of the House  Committee on Oversight and Government Reform to explain safety problems  that forced the world’s top automaker to recall 8.5 million of its most  popular cars and trucks.</p><p>Foreign executives, beyond the reach of congressional subpoenas, usually  try to avoid hearings that are often as much about public shaming as  improving the public good. Often, the task is left to underlings more  familiar with Washington or the issues under investigation.</p><p>That Toyoda agreed to testify after initially resisting an invitation is  proof of how deep Toyota’s problems are. But the track record of the  few foreign executives who have showed up on Capitol Hill illustrates  the many pitfalls that Toyoda faces, and the lasting effects his  performance could have on the company and his tenure.</p><p>“He will be in for a firestorm, but it is the honorable thing to do,”  said Mark Zupan, dean of the University of Rochester’s business school.  “It sends a big signal to actually show up on somebody else’s home  turf.”</p><p>Congress does not have the legal authority to compel citizens of foreign  countries to testify, according to Graham Wilson, a political scientist  at Boston University who studies politics and business. But Toyoda,  under enormous pressure to answer how long his company knew about safety  problems and whether it did enough to solve them, likely had little  choice but to accept an invitation from the committee last week.</p><p>Many analysts draw parallels between Toyoda and another Japanese auto  executive who testified nearly 10 years ago over a similar safety  debacle.</p><p>On Sept. 6, 2000, Masatoshi Ono went before House and Senate committees  investigating blowouts that led to the recall of millions of tires made  by his Bridgestone-Firestone company. It was a rare public appearance  for Ono, who admitted he was nervous and had practiced his opening  speech so that he could deliver it in English. He later used a  translator for questions, most of which were fielded by two senior  executives who sat with him.</p><p>The result was terrible. Ono apologized for deaths linked to the  blowouts but could not provide an answer to why they happened. Lawmakers  spent nearly 13 hours excoriating Ono and his company, the U.S.  division of the Japanese Bridgestone rubber conglomerate. Sen. Barbara  Mikulski, D-Md., even asked where his “sense of concern as a human being  was.” A month later, Ono resigned.</p><p>“It was a disaster,” said Jason Vines, who was the top spokesman at the  time for the Ford Motor Co., whose then-CEO, Jacques Nasser, was also  grilled by Congress that day about his company’s role in crashes  connected to blowouts.</p><p>Other foreign companies have tried different strategies during crises.</p><p>When Congress moved to block efforts by the Dubai-based DP World to  acquire management rights to six U.S. ports, the company enlisted its  chief operating officer, H. Edward Bilkey, a U.S. citizen, to testify on  its behalf in February 2006.</p><p>The grandson of a senator, Bilkey told the Senate Commerce Committee  that DP World would ensure security, a losing effort to allay lawmaker  fears over ceding port control to a foreign nation following the terror  attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. He also enlisted well-connected Washington  lobbying firms to help make his case.</p><p>A month later, DP World agreed to transfer the U.S. operations to a domestic company. Bilkey died in July 2006 at age 72.</p><p>Akio Toyoda has held press conferences in Japan since the crisis broke  several weeks ago, apologizing to consumers and promising to fix the  problems of faulty brakes in the Prius hybrid and unintended  acceleration in car brands like the Corolla and Camry.</p><p>But he will have to answer pointed questions from lawmakers during the  hearing, which could present an awkward situation. It is unclear if  Toyoda plans to use an interpreter, and his performance in English in  some of the press conferences has been mixed. The company says he speaks  the language well, but may get help to make sure his points are made  clearly.</p><p>As an executive in Japan, where businesses are generally treated with  reverence, he may also be unaccustomed to the grilling he will face,  according to Harvard Business School and former Medtronic CEO Bill  George.</p><p>But it will be a critical appearance for Toyoda to try to salvage both his own and Toyota’s reputation.</p><p>“When you are the grandson of the founder, you think you are protected,” George said. “But a crisis puts the job on the line.”</p><p><em>Copyright 2010&nbsp;The Associated Press.

Toyota has faced a burgeoning safety crisis over the past four  months with the recall of roughly 8.5 million vehicles over questions  involving gas pedals, accelerators getting jammed in floor mats and  brakes on various vehicles.</p><p>Rep. Edolphus Towns, D-N.Y., told Toyoda in his invitation that  motorists were “unsure as to what exactly the problem is, whether it is  safe to drive their cars, or what they should do about it.” Towns and  the committee’s top Republican, Rep. Darrell Issa of California, said  later that Toyoda’s testimony “will be helpful in understanding the  actions Toyota is taking to ensure the safety of American drivers.”</p><p>Towns said late Thursday that Toyoda would be joined by Yoshimi Inaba,  chairman and chief executive of Toyota Motor North America, and Jim  Lentz, president of Toyota Motor Sales USA.</p><p>Toyoda had said previously that he did not plan to attend a series of  hearings scheduled to start on Capitol Hill next week. But he had told  reporters in Japan earlier that he would consider appearing if invited.</p><p>The decision to testify came as the Transportation Department formally  opened a preliminary investigation into 487,000 Toyota Corolla and  Corolla Matrix compacts from the 2009-2010 model years over concerns  about steering problems at highway speeds. The government has received  168 complaints and reports of 11 injuries and eight crashes on the  Corolla and Matrix compacts with electric power steering.</p><p>The Corolla investigation was expected after Toyota said it was looking  into complaints of power steering difficulties with the vehicle and  considering a recall as one option.</p><p>Reports of deaths in the U.S. connected to sudden acceleration in Toyota  vehicles have surged in recent weeks, with the toll of deaths allegedly  attributed to the problem reaching 34 since 2000, according to new  consumer data gathered by the government.</p><p>Toyoda is the latest embattled auto executive to testify before  Congress, more than a year after the leaders of General Motors, Chrysler  and Ford sought support for the U.S. auto industry and were scolded for  traveling to the hearings in private jets. About a decade ago, the  leaders of Ford and tire maker Bridgestone/Firestone were grilled by  Congress after crashes involving exploding tires led to more than 250  traffic deaths.</p><p>By issuing the invitation, the committee had essentially forced Toyoda  to testify or face a subpoena. Issa had urged Toyoda to meet with  lawmakers and said if necessary, the committee should compel the  executive’s testimony.</p><p>Bill George, professor of management practice at Harvard Business School  and a former chairman and chief executive of Medtronic, said Toyoda was  “bowing to the pressure” by testifying and had made a “grievous error  in ducking public acknowledgment of the mistakes.”</p><p>George said Toyoda needed to offer “a sincere apology and a concrete set  of corrective actions, not ducking and weaving and saying this is not a  problem.”</p><p>In Japan and in the United States, Toyota Motor Corp. has been  criticized for a tepid response to the recalls and the company’s top  executive has been accused of being largely invisible as the recalls  escalated. But he has held three news conferences in recent weeks,  apologized repeatedly for the recalls and promised reforms.</p><p>Toyota has said it will create an outside review of company operations,  do a better job of responding to customer complaints and improve  communication with federal officials. Toyoda has said he plans to travel  to the U.S. soon to meet with workers and dealers but the company has  not yet released his schedule.</p><p>Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, senior associate dean at the Yale School of  Management, said Toyoda’s testimony would give the company a prime  opportunity to take responsibility for the problems. “He has to be  extremely well-prepared to take responsibility. He should take the full  force of the most hostile criticisms he gets and welcome them,”  Sonnenfeld said.</p><p>Congressional investigators and the Transportation Department have  demanded documents related to the Toyota recalls, seeking information on  how long the automaker knew of safety defects before taking action.</p><p>Toyota has provided about 50,000 pages of documents to congressional  investigators and continuing to answer questions from staff members,  said Josephine Cooper, Toyota’s group vice president for public policy  and government and industry affairs. Cooper said technicians from a  Toyota training center in Maryland have been demonstrating to House  aides the company’s fix for floor mat entrapment and sticky accelerator  pedals.</p><p>In a separate move, the Oversight Committee subpoenaed Toyota documents  from Dimitrios Biller, a former counsel for Toyota’s U.S. operations  from 2003-2007. The committee said it was seeking documents related to  motor vehicle safety, the company’s handling of defects and related  litigation.</p><p>Toyota faces questions from three committees in Congress. The House  Energy and Commerce Committee moved its scheduled hearing up to Feb. 23,  one day ahead of the Oversight Committee meeting. The energy panel has  invited Lentz and David Strickland, the head of the National Highway  Traffic Safety Administration, to testify. A Senate hearing, chaired by  West Virginia Sen. Jay Rockefeller, is planned for March 2.</p><p><em>Copyright  2010&nbsp;The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

If we fail to do so,  the U.S. will enter an extended period of stagnation much like Europe  and Japan.</p><p>Is there a culprit for these trends? Finger-pointing abounds, but I believe the root cause is leaders practicing short-termism.</p><p>In the 1980s and 1990s, America looked up to business leaders who  created growing companies, dominated world markets, and employed  millions in well-paying jobs. Today’s business leaders are so poorly  trusted that they rank near the bottom of every poll.</p><p>Looking back at the last decade, it’s not hard to see why. The 2000s  began with the Enron scandal and ended with global financial market  meltdowns. In between, we were treated to the mischief of Bernie Ebbers  of WorldCom, Richard Scrushy of Health South, Dennis Koslowski of Tyco,  and the infamous Bernie Madoff</p><p>The leadership issues go much deeper. As I wrote in Authentic  Leadership, capitalism became the victim of its own success. In the  early part of the decade, hundreds of corporations restated their  revenues and earnings as their leaders were exposed for accounting  manipulations that hyped stock prices to maximize shareholder value.</p><p>Following the 2003 passage of Sarbanes-Oxley, many corporations  cleaned up their acts. They replaced their CEOs with new leaders who  have a long-term perspective on serving customers and building  shareholder value.</p><p>Unfortunately, many Wall Street leaders never got the message. They  continued to play the short-term game with excessive risk-taking and  leverage. As <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=C\">Citigroup</a>‘s Chuck Prince told the Financial Times in July 2007, <a href=\"http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/80e2987a-2e50-11dc-821c-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1\" target=\"_blank\">“As long as the music is playing, you’ve got to get up and dance.

But many people bought into Milton Friedman’s view that the  purpose of the corporation is to maximize shareholder value. They were  handsomely rewarded for delivering short-term results, but their  collective behavior led to the destruction of long-term shareholder  value, and in many cases their institutions as well.</p><p>What’s ahead for the next decade? Often a severe crisis is required  to lay the groundwork for a major transformation in leadership. That’s  exactly what is happening now. A new generation of corporate leaders is  stepping forward that recognizes their responsibilities go well beyond  enriching their shareholders and themselves. These new leaders recognize  their corporations are chartered to serve society by creating value for  their customers, sustainable jobs, and lasting value for their owners.</p><p>These new leaders face the challenge of building their corporations  while at the same time rebuilding America’s dominance of the world  economy. Rather than criticizing them, we should get behind their  efforts.</p>"

This unexpected outcome has almost certainly doomed the President’s  long-desired health-insurance bill.</p><p>Now the Obama Administration  must regroup to determine whether any part of his domestic agenda—energy  cap and trade, financial system reform, jobs stimulus, or health-care  reform—is still viable.</p><p>As he triumphantly took office a year  ago, the 44th President had little reason to think that his best-laid  plans might go astray. He was of course aware that he faced  unprecedented challenges: the aftermath of the financial meltdown, wars  in Iraq and Afghanistan, and mounting job losses. But the new President  was buoyed by soaring expectations from voters who selected him as a  leader who would solve enormous problems, in part by eschewing “the old  politics” of government influenced by lobbyists.</p><p>His political  and legislative agenda was the most ambitious in decades. He focused on  stabilizing the financial system, pushing through an $800 billion  stimulus bill, and targeted early passage of health-care reform. Then he  planned to tackle climate change and banking reform—all in 2009.</p><p><strong>a defining moment</strong></p><strong>a defining moment</strong><p>One  year into his term, not only has Obama’s agenda stalled, but he faces a  crisis of confidence that will define his leadership. The real issue is  not health care, but whether Obama the Leader or Obama the Politician  will dominate. Like the Roman god Janus, whose two heads faced in  opposite directions, Obama the Leader pulls against Obama the  Politician. This dichotomy is eroding the President’s political capital  and alienating him from voters.</p><p>We have always known there were  two Obamas: the idealistic and compassionate community organizer whose  service changed lives and the skilled politician that emerged from  political wars on Chicago’s South Side. During the Presidential  campaign, Obama brilliantly integrated these two facets of his persona.  Most of us who voted for him believed that, once in office, Obama the  Leader would dominate.</p><p>On the international front Obama has led  with poise and wisdom. Bipartisan appointments of Hillary Clinton and  Robert Gates as Secretaries of State and Defense give him a highly  experienced leadership team. His new style of respectful leadership and  an “open hand” to the world are restoring trust in the U.S., resulting  in the Nobel Peace Prize. His decisive response to the Haitian tragedy  displayed competence and empathy.</p><p>Yet on the domestic front Obama  has floundered. There he chose to play the Washington insider’s  political game, giving broad access and influence to lobbyists. Many  Cabinet and White House staff appointees are former politicians, some of  whom have steeper learning curves than others, but there is not a  single business person in the entire Administration. Chief of Staff Rahm  Emanuel has led countless rounds of dealmaking with Congress and  lobbyists representing virtually every special interest group from  insurance companies to labor unions.</p><p><strong>unintended consequences</strong></p><strong>unintended consequences</strong><p>Instead  of proposing a comprehensive health-care policy, Obama effectively  abdicated his power by turning health care over to Congress. With nearly  one-fifth of the nation’s GDP resting on the outcome, politicians and  lobbyists produced a mish-mash of regulations no one understands.  Democratic leaders made hundreds of side deals within their own ranks  that would produce myriad unintended consequences.</p><p>Beyond health  care, Obama’s populist criticism of the banks reflects a disconnect  between sound policy and reality. The banks—essential actors in any  functional financial system—must play a significant role in any  recovery. Instead of tackling meaningful regulatory reform that protects  the nation from excessive leverage among interdependent financial  intermediaries, he opted for politically popular moves such as a banking  tax. (Disclosure: I sit on the board of Goldman Sachs (<a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=GS\">GS</a>).)</p><a href=\"http://investing.businessweek.com/research/stocks/snapshot/snapshot.asp?symbol=GS\">GS</a><p>Meanwhile,  16 months after Wall Street’s collapse, no financial reform legislation  is close to passing. Contrast that with the fact that the  Sarbanes-Oxley legislation was passed in 31 days following Enron’s  demise.</p><p>Most pressing of all for Obama’s second-year agenda is  the deepening jobs crisis. Twenty-five million Americans—17.3% of the  workforce—lack full-time jobs. While the massive stimulus bill saved  some jobs, it did virtually nothing to create new ones. This November,  absent a major jobs revival, voters’ frustrations are likely to be  directed at the party in power, further weakening the President’s  ability to lead an increasingly dysfunctional Congress.</p><p>At the  outset of his second year, Obama faces a choice. Obama the Politician  would fan the flames of populist anger to solidify his base. Obama the  Leader would follow in the footsteps of President Clinton—who also faced  failed health-care reform—and pivot to the political center to address  the nation’s most pressing problems, starting with job creation.</p><p>For the sake of our nation’s health, let’s hope that Obama the Leader will prevail in the year ahead.</p>"

The medical device industry, in contrast, proposed taxing hospital purchasing groups instead, which would pass some or all of that tax on to device makers. That apparently rankled lawmakers, who initially proposed a $40 billion levy on the industry over 10 years. That was later scaled back to $20 billion, but a deal with unions to exempt them from a tax on high-end “Cadillac” healthcare plans prompted legislators to propose&nbsp;<a title=\"MassDevice.com news\" href=\"http://www.massdevice.com/node/5467/edit\">adding $10 billion back into the tax</a>.</p><a title=\"MassDevice.com news\" href=\"http://www.massdevice.com/node/5467/edit\">adding $10 billion back into the tax</a><p>George, now a professor at Harvard Business School with seats on the boards of Exxon Mobil and Goldman Sachs said that although he thinks government will have to raise more money to pay for healthcare, taxing medical devices isn’t the way to do it.

Lots of those employees out of the U.S., but guess what, the ratio is still 75 percent Americans, 25 percent non-Americans, and very heavily in Minnesota,” he told the MPR. “And those are good jobs.

On  stage, Mr. Bezos was proudly proclaiming Amazon’s success (measured in  eyeballs) when Mr. Buffett challenged him from the audience.</p><p>Having worked the numbers, Mr. Buffett said there was simply no way  to justify Amazon’s stock price, even assuming remarkable growth and  profitability. At the time Amazon was near $105 per share, with no  earnings but a growing revenue base. Mr. Bezos protested Mr. Buffett’s  critique, but suspicious murmurs rumbled through the audience.</p><p>Cisco’s Mr. Chambers was also on stage that day. Cisco was riding  high with a rising stock price. Throughout the next year Cisco stock  increased to $77 a share, making the company <a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/2100-1033-238483.html\" target=\"_blank\">the world’s most valuable in March 2000</a>.</p><a href=\"http://news.cnet.com/2100-1033-238483.html\" target=\"_blank\">the world’s most valuable in March 2000</a><p>The higher they go, the farther they fall. In 2001 the dotcom bubble  burst. Thousands of startups went belly up as the venture capital market  virtually shut down. Amazon and Cisco both suffered from aftershocks of  the implosion.</p><p>Amazon’s stock collapsed to $6 per share. Cisco’s crash was just as  dramatic: from its high water mark, Cisco stock dropped nearly 90%. If  Warren Buffett was in the business of shorting stocks, he could have  made a killing on his prescient analysis.</p><p>Wall Street called for the blood of e-commerce and technology  companies. Skeptics projected the end was near. Unlike many of their  fallen contemporaries, however, both Amazon and Cisco rebounded.</p><p>Amazon’s Mr. Bezos simply ignored the stock collapse as he moved  forward with his strategic vision. In 2003 Amazon posted its first  full-year profit. Throughout the decade Mr. Bezos continued to expand  the company’s product offerings. Even amidst the current economic  crisis, Amazon’s third-quarter profits surged 69% as the company  established its supremacy in e-retailing.</p><p>John Chambers oversaw a similar recovery. Cisco has continued to  dominate the market for computer servers and expanded into related  products, such as its dramatic new TelePresence offering.</p><p>What allowed Amazon and Cisco to persevere as other Web 1.0  contemporaries tanked? How have they successfully navigated another  vicious downturn?</p><p>The answers can be found in the belief that Mr. Bezos and Mr.  Chambers have in their strategies and an unwavering passion for serving  their customers. They power their visions with big investments in  innovation and manage for long-term growth, even at the expense of  short-term profitability.</p><p>Mr. Bezos founded Amazon.com in 1994 with secondhand computer  stations in his Seattle garage. “There’s no bad time to innovate,” Mr.  Bezos told <a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_17/b4081064880218.htm?chan=search\" target=\"_blank\">BusinessWeek in 2008</a>.  “You should be doing it when times are good and when times are tough.”   Currently, Mr. Bezos is transforming the book-reading business with the  Kindle e-reader, Amazon’s first in-house hardware product.</p><a href=\"http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_17/b4081064880218.htm?chan=search\" target=\"_blank\">BusinessWeek in 2008</a><p>Mr. Chambers has continued to build Cisco through innovation and  long-term acquisition strategies. The company introduced its  TelePresence product and focused its acquisitions on video and mobile  technologies.</p><p>Through their long-term commitments, Mr. Bezos and Mr. Chambers have  created tremendous value for their shareholders: Cisco’s market  capitalization is now about $140 billion, while Amazon’s is about $58  billion.</p><p>To put the American economy back on the road to recovery, we need  more long-term, visionary leaders like Mr. Chambers and Mr. Bezos who  can transform entire industries and build sustainable innovation  machines.</p>"

Americans lack confidence in the  nation’s leadership to address the challenges the nation currently  faces.</p><p> The Harvard Center for Public Leadership’s 2009 <a href=\"http://bit.ly/24SCJC\">National Leadership Index</a> reveals that 69 percent of Americans think we have a leadership crisis  in the country. Another 67 percent believe that “unless we get better  leaders, the United States will decline as a nation.”</p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/24SCJC\">National Leadership Index</a><p> At the bottom of the index’s ranking of confidence in leadership are  Wall Street leaders, closely followed by news media, Congressional, and  business leaders. It is tempting for leaders to view these dismal  results as a public relations issue emanating from the economic  downturn. But this is not a PR problem: it’s a leadership problem.</p><p> We opened this decade with a wave of appalling leadership failures. Ken  Lay and Jeff Skilling of Enron, Bernie Ebbers of WorldCom, Joseph  Nacchio of Qwest, and Dennis Kozlowski of Tyco blatantly disregarded the  ethical and legal responsibilities entrusted to them by their  shareholders. </p><p> We are closing the decade with another wave of leadership failures. Dick  Fuld of Lehman, Alan Schwartz of Bear Stearns, Angelo Mozilo of  Countrywide Financial, and Chuck Prince of Citigroup sacrificed  financial prudence for the possibility of extraordinary short-term  gains. Their decisions obliterated billions of dollars of economic  wealth and almost destroyed the nation’s financial system. </p><p> This crisis won’t be over until a new generation of leaders emerges that  understands that long-term institutional stewardship and maintaining  public trust are the two imperatives of 21<sup>st</sup>-century leadership.</p><sup>st</sup><p> Far too many leaders fell into the trap of believing that the purpose of  business is to maximize shareholder value and reap personal rewards,  rather than serve customers and the society they operate in. In my  experience, those that focus primarily on maximizing shareholder value,  usually with a short-term focus, are more likely to destroy the value  they created. </p><p> A recent <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/21/business/economy/21charts.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=floyd%20norris%20november%2021%202009&amp;st=cse\">study</a> of S&amp;P 700 international stocks from 1998 to 2009 shows that only  three of the top fifteen winners are American – Apple, Amazon, and  Oracle – all of which are headed by leaders with long-term focus. The  five worst U.S. stocks – AIG, Kodak, Citigroup, Ford and Bristol-Myers –  had leaders with a short-term focus. This list excludes GM, K-Mart,  Enron, WorldCom, and Lehman since they declared bankruptcy.</p><a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/21/business/economy/21charts.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=floyd%20norris%20november%2021%202009&amp;st=cse\">study</a><p> Long-term leaders recognize they cannot rely upon cost-cutting,  acquisitions, and other short-term moves to create sustainable value. By  focusing clearly on their long-term mission, values, and strategies,  they earn and keep the trust of their customers, their employees and the  society they serve. </p><p> The key to creating sustainable shareholder value is to provide superior  value to your customers. Companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson, Target,  Google, Medtronic, and Wells Fargo focus on their mission and values,  which is what motivates their employees. When a company does these  things well, revenues and profits expand and sustainable shareholder  value follows. </p><p> A number of progressive corporate leaders are emerging that recognize  the need for long-term focus to create sustainable value. For example,  IBM’s Sam Palmisano embarked upon a seven-year “leading by values”  initiative to reposition the firm globally and emphasize its service  businesses. Indra Nooyi committed PepsiCo to a long-term focus on  expanding healthy food and beverage offerings. Dan Vasella of Novartis  invested heavily in drug and vaccines research to prevent and treat  intractable diseases. John Chambers is making acquisitions during the  downturn to prepare Cisco to lead a new productivity expansion. Amazon’s  Jeff Bezos keeps introducing product innovations like the Kindle—even  though they take five to seven years to payoff. </p><p> In an earlier era, Walter Wriston of Citigroup and John Whitehead of  Goldman Sachs capably steered the financial markets with honesty,  intelligence, and dignity. As many firms failed in 2008, three Wall  Street leaders emerged. J.P. Morgan’s Jamie Dimon created a culture of  candor enabling his bank to successfully navigate through the financial  crisis. Goldman Sachs’ Lloyd Blankfein (on whose board I serve) built  effective risk management into the bank’s DNA. John Stumpf emphasized  Wells Fargo’s core strengths and focused on commercial banking to use  the crisis to strengthen its franchise.</p><p> The path to restoring the public’s confidence and trust in business  leaders is clear. We need leaders who are committed to sustainable  growth over short-term gains and serving society by creating long-term  value.</p>"

During that career, he served 14 years as CEO of UTC and helped UTC triple its revenue, expand globally and focus on its process and technology disciplines.</p><strong>George David</strong><p><strong>Joseph Engelberger</strong>&nbsp;– Founder of Unimation, the first robot company and considered the “father of robotics,” Engelberger went on to found HelpMate Robotics. He is the author of “Robotics in Practice and Robotics in Service,” and is the recipient of numerous awards, including the Progress Award of the Society of Manufacturing Engineers, the Leonardo da Vinci Award of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers and the 1997 Japan Prize, the highest Japanese technology honor.</p><strong>Joseph Engelberger</strong><p><strong>William George</strong>&nbsp;– After distinguished careers at Litton Industries and Honeywell, George became CEO and chairman of the board of Medtronic. Under his leadership, Medtronic’s market capitalization grew from $1.1 billion to $60 billion, averaging 35% a year. He now serves as a professor of management practice at Harvard Business School.</p><strong>William George</strong><p><strong>Andrew Grove</strong>&nbsp;– A senior adviser at Intel, Grove helped found the company Intel in 1968 and served as its CEO from 1987 to 1998.

In 2007 he founded the Museum of Russian Icons in Clinton, Mass., with the largest collection of Russian icons publicly displayed outside of Russia.</p><strong>Gordon Lankton</strong><p><strong>Jack Welch</strong>&nbsp;– A chemical engineer by training, Welch joined General Electric in 1960 and became its youngest vice president in 1972. In 1981, he began a 20-year tenure as GE CEO, during which the company’s market capitalization rose from $13 billion to $400 billion. Welch streamlined GE operations, championed Six Sigma and combined latitude for GE managers with an insistence that GE businesses be at the top of their market segments.</p><strong>Jack Welch</strong><p><strong>James Womack</strong>&nbsp;– From 1975-1991 Womack was a research scientist at MIT directing a series of comparative studies of world manufacturing practices. Womack led the research team that coined the term “lean production” to describe the Toyota Production System. He is the co-author of such influential bestsellers as “The Machine That Changed the World” and “Lean Thinking”. He founded the Lean Enterprise Institute in 1997.</p><strong>James Womack</strong><p>Congratulations to&nbsp;<em>IW Manufacturing Hall of Fame</em>&nbsp;Inaugural Class of 2009.</p><em>IW Manufacturing Hall of Fame</em><p>Contact: Bethany Weaver, 1-216-931-9551,&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:bethany.weaver@penton.com\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">bethany.weaver@penton.com</span></a>.</p><a href=\"mailto:bethany.weaver@penton.com\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">bethany.weaver@penton.com</span></a><span>bethany.weaver@penton.com</span>"

Like many other halls  of fame, we looked for individuals with a history of significant  achievements, living examples of a combination of character, talent,  drive and productive work that resulted in outstanding success in their  organizations. But we also sought individuals who had demonstrated  vision and leadership that had transcended those boundaries and impacted  the larger manufacturing community and even our society as a whole. In  some way, these 10 outstanding people likely have touched all our lives,  from the cars we drive to the computers on our desks to the ideas that  have helped inspire how we run our businesses. Their story is part of  our story as the <strong>IndustryWeek</strong> audience continues to write the next chapter in American manufacturing.</p><strong>IndustryWeek</strong><p>Infor is delighted to serve as the sponsor for the inaugural class of the <strong>IndustryWeek</strong> Manufacturing Hall of Fame. <a href=\"http://www.industryweek.com/slideshows/HallofFame2009/george-david-2009.asp\">George David</a>, <a href=\"http://www.industryweek.com/slideshows/HallofFame2009/Joseph-Engelberger-2009.asp\">Joseph Engelberger</a>, <a href=\"http://www.industryweek.com/slideshows/HallofFame2009/William-George-2009.asp\">William George</a>, <a href=\"http://www.industryweek.com/slideshows/HallofFame2009/Andrew-Grove-2009.asp\">Andrew Grove</a>, <a href=\"http://www.industryweek.com/slideshows/HallofFame2009/Charles-Holliday-2009.asp\">Charles Holliday</a>, <a href=\"http://www.industryweek.com/slideshows/HallofFame2009/Lee-Iacocca-2009.asp\">Lee Iacocca</a>, <a href=\"http://www.industryweek.com/slideshows/HallofFame2009/Steve-Jobs-2009.asp\">Steve Jobs</a>, <a href=\"http://www.industryweek.com/slideshows/HallofFame2009/Gordon-Lankton-2009.asp\">Gordon Lankton</a>, <a href=\"http://www.industryweek.com/slideshows/HallofFame2009/Jack-Welch-2009.asp\">Jack Welch</a> and <a href=\"http://www.industryweek.com/slideshows/HallofFame2009/James-Womack-2009.asp\">James Womack</a> bring rich legacies of leadership, intellectual vigor and proven  performance in both their businesses and social commitments.

Companies have become increasingly global, sourcing their  products across continents, seeking new markets in developing nations  and welcoming talent from around the world. They have invested in new  technologies that have made manufacturing operations faster, more  flexible, leaner and more productive. At the heart of many of these  changes has been unprecedented access to, and use of, communications and  information technology, allowing component orders placed in Atlanta to  be processed in Bangalore, manufactured in Shenzhen and shipped to  Seattle with increasing precision, speed and clarity.</p><p>Since its founding in 2002, Infor has worked hard to provide its  customers with software built for the way they do business. We never  forget the value of human creativity, experience and hard work in  solving business challenges. The 10 members of the <strong>IndustryWeek</strong> Manufacturing Hall of Fame all have demonstrated that people are the most important assets of a company.</p><strong>IndustryWeek</strong><p>On behalf of the more than 8,000 associates of Infor, we salute the <strong>IndustryWeek</strong> Manufacturing Hall of Fame inductees and wish them continued success.</p><strong>IndustryWeek</strong><p><a href=\"http://www.industryweek.com/slideshows/HallofFame2009/george-david-2009.asp\">Click here to see the 2009 inductees and why they were selected.</a></p><a href=\"http://www.industryweek.com/slideshows/HallofFame2009/george-david-2009.asp\">Click here to see the 2009 inductees and why they were selected.</a>"

In the House vote, one issue group (antiabortion)  forced another issue group (revision of the health-care system) to yield  on one of its preferences in order to achieve others. That is the way  of democracy.</p><p>Leaders must always weigh and rank priorities because they can seldom  get everything they want. When one surrenders a lesser goal in order to  achieve a higher goal, that is generally a sign of good leadership; when  one surrenders a more important goal to win on a lesser goal, that is  poor leadership. The trick is determining which goal is of the higher  priority. In this case, the president and the speaker concluded that  passing a health-care bill now was more important than either access to  abortion or a more comprehensive government insurance program.</p><p>In 1965, Democratic leaders in Congress, working with President Lyndon  B. Johnson, gave up hopes for a broad national health insurance program  in order to enact smaller pieces of one — Medicare, to cover the  elderly, and Medicaid, to cover the indigent. Today, those are  considered by advocates of health-care subsidies to be monumental  achievements.</p><p>It’s not a matter of weighing what you get against what you fail to get;  it’s a matter of weighing what you get against what you would have  gotten if you had failed to reach a compromise. Some leaders are  visionaries whose legacies are inspirational, but other leaders are  realists whose legacies are often solid, if incomplete, achievements.  Both kinds of leadership are valuable, and people placed in positions of  formal leadership quite frequently have to decide which kinds of  leaders they will choose to be.</p><p><em>Bill George is a management professor at the Harvard Business School,</em> <em>and</em> <em>former chairman and</em> <em>chief executive</em> <em>of Medtronic. His latest book is “7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis.”</em></p><em>Bill George is a management professor at the Harvard Business School,</em><em>and</em><em>former chairman and</em><em>chief executive</em><em>of Medtronic. His latest book is “7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis.”</em><p>The lack of genuine leadership on the health insurance bill is  discouraging, both from the White House and the Congress. The majority  party has an unworkable plan to reform insurance that offers no real  cost savings and enormous future expenses and doesn’t address the impact  of quality and lifestyle issues.</p><p>Having chosen to put politics ahead of policy, the Democrats are left to  compromise their values to force the bill through. I anticipate many  more compromises of principles and good policy on the Senate side and in  conference committee, turning the ultimate bill into a mishmash of laws  that will have to be fixed later.</p><p>This is not leadership. It is painful to watch it unfold.</p><p><em>Yash Gupta is dean of the Johns Hopkins</em> <em>University</em> <em>Carey Business School.</em></p><em>Yash Gupta is dean of the Johns Hopkins</em><em>University</em><em>Carey Business School.</em><p>Any important piece of legislation that comes before Congress must be  based on a solid set of principles. Of course, politics is the art of  compromise, but at some point one has to ask: Compromise to what end?  One can compromise too much. When all the bargains and the concessions  become so numerous that they obscure the original principles of the  proposal, then it might be time to step back and decide to fight another  day.</p><p>The nation has been through this before, with the Social Security Act of  1935 and the Medicare/Medicare bill of 1965. Both were strongly  opposed, but in both instances the presidents, along with other leaders  in Washington, were steadfast in adhering to the principles on which the  proposals were based. They made sure the nation understood that these  reforms would benefit the people.</p><p>By contrast, <a href=\"http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Barack_Obama\">President Obama</a> has done a poor job of selling his proposal. He never took a strong  leadership role; he didn’t use his bully pulpit to spell out clearly why  the nation needs this reform. The result has been a great deal of  ambiguity and confusion. That, in turn, has given energy to his  opponents, who have commandeered the issue and couched it in their own  terms.</p><a href=\"http://www.whorunsgov.com/Profiles/Barack_Obama\">President Obama</a><p>This could have been a crowning, shining achievement for the president,  and when you think of all the goodwill and momentum with which he  entered office, it’s hard to escape the disappointing conclusion that he  has squandered a major opportunity.</p>"

Should we expect lower motivation on banks executives to increase the financial system efficiency? Or lower motivation to join into riskier ventures?</strong></p><strong>What are the other consequent negative impacts of this cut? Should we expect lower motivation on banks executives to increase the financial system efficiency? Or lower motivation to join into riskier ventures?</strong><p>The pay cuts reinforce the idea that the “quick-fix” is the “best-fix.” That is seldom, if ever, the case.&nbsp; I have been highly critical of short-termist Wall Street leaders like Dick Fuld at Lehman Brothers and Ken Lewis at Bank of America, but simply firing those leaders and curbing lavish pay are solutions that only satisfy the short-term.&nbsp; I believe that the best way to ensure we don’t fall into similar traps again, and similarly flawed leadership take hold again, is to work towards a Wall Street culture shift.&nbsp; A quick-hitting executive compensation curb may satisfy voters and smooth ruffled political feathers, but it won’t help work towards a long-lasting solution.</p><p> <strong>What can the Government or the Bank`s Boards do to avoid the bankers being vilified?</strong></p><strong>What can the Government or the Bank`s Boards do to avoid the bankers being vilified?</strong><p>The federal government can now work with willing CEOs and investors to alter the short-termist culture that has infiltrated Wall Street, not try to regulate it into submission from Washington, DC.&nbsp; This means providing the right incentives, including those that provides market-based incentives through restructured tax policy, aligns investor interest with company interests, and increases the transparency of shareholder/investor influence.&nbsp; To accomplish this, we need everyone – investors, bankers, Fortune 500 CEOs, politicians – to gather together and hammer out a mutually agreeable consensus.&nbsp; </p>"

Currently a teacher at the Harvard Business School, he also believes a culture split within business schools is feeding short-term thinking within the financial industry.</p><p>Also on the board of Exxon Mobil, George brings a global perspective and broad business experience to his writing, teaching and speaking as well as a blunt and outspoken perspective. Recently in town to promote his newest book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.billgeorge.org/page/7-lessons-for-leading-in-crisis\" target=\"_blank\">“7 Lesson for Leading in Crisis,”</a>&nbsp;George shared with me his perspective on, among other topics, the recent market meltdown, rethinking risk and failures of leadership among.

We thought we could take risk out, but we failed to assess the human risk and the fact the models didn’t reflect reality. Typically, they’re history-based, and the history was way too short, five to 10 years.”</p><strong>On failed leadership and risk:</strong><br><p>“I’ve never believed in institutional risk, and you don’t see me sitting on any boards — Goldman becomes the closest to it — that’s taking significant institutional risk. It’s a destructive act, not responsible, to put the whole company at risk. Think of the worst thing that could actually happen that could destroy the place. Like at Medtronic — what if we had a software glitch … that went across all of our products, it could destroy the company and harm people dramatically.”</p><p>The problems within the financial industry “have long roots. So you can’t look at [current Citigroup CEO] Vikram Pandit you can barely look at [Pandit’s predecessor] Chuck Prince. You have to go way back. [Former CEO] Sandy Weill’s the one who created this culture. He’s not a bad guy, but he didn’t create a culture of sound risk management.”</p><p><strong>On the culture split within business schools:</strong><br>“There is a split in almost every business school … The values course is over here, the finance course is over there and never the twain shall meet. I don’t worry about the people going into the corporate side, going to work for Procter &amp; Gamble or General Mills. I worry about people motivated by short term gratification to make a lot of money.”</p><strong>On the culture split within business schools:</strong><br><p>“But I think [the current market turmoil] will be a wonderful crucible experience for this new generation of business leaders … to realize the world is not about picking up gold lying in the streets … to realize that models or the latest financial techniques aren’t everything. You’ve got to build yourself to be a leader. To paraphrase [GE CEO] Jeff Immelt; there’s no way you can truly prepare to become a CEO. What you’ve got to do is learn how to learn from your experiences and quickly adapt.”</p>"

You may have led your organization in this crisis and have to face the reality that things are in trouble, and now you have to go in a whole different direction.

This distinguished and  diverse group is unified in calling for a comprehensive examination of  market short-termism in our economy. The signatories hope that policy  makers in Congress, the Executive branch, and relevant regulatory  agencies will heed this call. &nbsp;</p><p>“As America slowly pulls itself  out of the worst recession in history, it is vital that long-term vision  rather than short-term gain guides economic decision-making in the  decades to come. We cannot afford to repeat the mistakes that led us to  the economic damage currently surrounding us,” said Jim Rogers,  chairman, president and CEO of Duke Energy, and a signatory to the  statement. “We hope the proposals here will help to focus the attention  of business and investors on long-term performance.”</p><p>“I was  pleased to be part of the non-partisan group that drafted this statement  because I’m convinced that we need to make fundamental changes in the  economic incentives that drive decisions in the public and private  sectors,” John F. Olson remarked. “I see real danger in our settling for  cosmetic reforms that don’t address the critical problem: failure to  aim for long term sustainable value.” </p><p>Richard L. Trumka,  Secretary-Treasurer, AFL-CIO, also stated: “Workers’ pension funds need  capital markets that work on behalf of a strong real economy, not  against it, and that requires long term time horizons.”</p><p>Recognizing  that voluntary action alone is not enough to address today’s economic  reality, a small group came together to create the foundation for this  much-needed public policy conversation. The current drafting committee  began with a set of ideas shared in Aspen CVSG meetings among varied  market players beginning in July 2008. This effort builds on the CVSG’s  ongoing focus on sustainable value for investors and society, including  the “Aspen Principles for Long-Term Value Creation,” that were released  in June 2007 by a coalition of business, labor, institutional investors,  and corporate governance experts. The Principles called for voluntary  change in practice by business and investors around metrics of success,  investor communications, and executive compensation. </p><p>“Short-termism  must be addressed as a conceptual whole — piecemeal approaches do not  work,” said Judith Samuelson, executive director of the Aspen  Institute’s Business &amp; Society Program. “Now is the time for bold  ideas to drive change in the incentives and behaviors critical to  transformation of how value is created and sustained.”</p><p>Added Bill  George, author of 7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis and former CEO of  Medtronic: &amp;lldquo;Short-termism is the root cause of the financial meltdown of  the past year. To rebuild the US economy, we must restructure  incentives around long-term sustainable performance.”</p><p><strong>Reporters  and editors are welcome to join a press call with three signatories, J.

In its wake  the Great Recession <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/10/02/broader-unemployment-rate-hits-17-in-september/\">destroyed trillions in economic value and left 25 million Americans, or 17 percent of the work force, without full-time jobs</a>.</p><a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/10/02/broader-unemployment-rate-hits-17-in-september/\">destroyed trillions in economic value and left 25 million Americans, or 17 percent of the work force, without full-time jobs</a><p>Those who fear a repeat crisis are right to be concerned. We have  endured similar crises before like the savings and loan debacle, the  collapse of Long-Term Capital Management, and the dot com implosion.  Unfortunately, Wall Street ignored these lessons and recreated the  short-term practices leading to the 2008 financial meltdown.</p><p>To prevent recurrence, we cannot just pass quick-fix solutions.  Measures like regulating executive pay merely treat symptoms of larger  problems, and may distract us from actions required to rebuild a  sustainable economy.</p><p>This crisis wasn’t caused by subprime mortgages; it was caused by  subprime leadership. Its root cause is leaders who practice  short-termism. The culture of short-termism—investing for short-term  gains at the expense of long-term accumulation—has taken hold on Wall  Street. Managerial capitalism has replaced financial capitalism as  holding periods for stocks dropped from eight years in the 1960s to as  low as six months today.</p><p>Warren Buffett once said that the best holding period is “forever.” That philosophy <a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/33107708\" target=\"_blank\">earned him $40 billion </a>and  the reputation as America’s best investor. Unfortunately, long-term  value investing is decidedly out of favor these days. Instead, investors  pursuing short-term returns pressure corporate leaders to meet  quarterly expectations rather than creating long-term sustainability and  growth.</p><a href=\"http://www.cnbc.com/id/33107708\" target=\"_blank\">earned him $40 billion </a><p>Many corporate leaders fell prey to playing this short-term game.  They bought into the widely-believed myths that a company’s stock price  represents its true economic value and that success can be measured by  comparing quarterly earnings to security analysts’ expectations.</p><p>They hyped their stock prices with short-term actions or made  value-destroying acquisitions that crimped their long-term  competitiveness, often putting their entire business at risk. Many of  their firms, like General Motors, <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=aig\">AIG</a> and <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=c\">Citigroup</a>, are barely surviving now.</p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=aig\">AIG</a><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=c\">Citigroup</a><p>According to a McKinsey study, 65 to 70 percent of mergers and  acquisitions destroy shareholder value. But CEOs seeking quick fixes for  long-term strategic problems often ignore these statistical realities.</p><p>No sooner do companies complete their merger binges than activist  investors buy small ownership positions to pressure management into  spin-offs, divestitures, or other balance sheet chicanery. By this time  the companies are so loaded down with debt and pressured to meet  quarterly earnings expectations that they abandon their strategies and  spin off the lifeblood of their businesses.</p><p>Harvard University Professor Michael Porter, the world’s leading academic strategist, noted recently, <a href=\"http://bit.ly/3D01JW\" target=\"_blank\">“Capital markets can be toxic to strategy.”</a> Porter argues that creating economic value is not the same as creating  shareholder value because it requires focus on strategic growth instead  of short-term earnings. The Aspen Institute echoes this sentiment. It  recently issued a clarion call for “Overcoming Short-termism” that was  endorsed by 28 national leaders.</p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/3D01JW\" target=\"_blank\">“Capital markets can be toxic to strategy.”</a><p>The reality is that it still takes nearly a decade to create lasting  shareholder value through breakthrough new products like blockbuster  drugs, innovative distribution networks like <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=wmt\">Wal-Mart</a> and <a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=sbux\">Starbucks</a>, or a values-based, collaborative culture like IBM’s.</p><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=wmt\">Wal-Mart</a><a href=\"http://online.wsj.com/public/quotes/main.html?type=djn&amp;symbol=sbux\">Starbucks</a><p>To prevent future crises, we need a new generation of leaders that  recognizes the pitfalls inherent to practicing short-termism. These  leaders must be ready for the long-haul effort that is required to  create sustainable value, even if they have to constrain short-term  results.</p><p>I am encouraged that many such leaders are emerging at the helm of  major companies and Wall Street firms. Dan Vasella of Novartis and Jeff  Kindler of Pfizer are transforming their pharmaceutical firms into 21st  century health care leaders, just as Indra Nooyi of PepsiCo and Ken  Powell of General Mills are becoming role models for developing  sustainable consumer goods companies. Richard Davis of U.S. Bancorp and  Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan are demonstrating how banks can balance  risk-taking with sound financial management.</p><p>If the U.S. wants to be the world’s leading economic power, President  Obama needs to reinforce a long-term focus by shifting his efforts to  building a sustainable economy, rather than bowing to pressures for  instant gratification. This means refocusing national priorities on  health care innovation, renewable energy sources, high-tech  manufacturing, and broadened use of information technology. The  government can facilitate this shift with a graduated capital gains tax  favoring long-term investments and start-up companies, increased  permanent R&amp;D tax credits, expanded investment tax credits, and  skills-based retraining programs.</p><p>Then a new generation of corporate and Wall Street leaders, supported  by elected leaders, can build a sustainable economy that creates wealth  and jobs for all Americans.</p>"

      "<p>SUSIE GHARIB: Tonight’s commentator has some thoughts about leaders during the financial crisis. He’s Bill George, former chairman and CEO at Medtronic and author of “Seven Lessons for Leading in a Crisis.”</p><p>BILL GEORGE, AUTHOR, “7 LESSONS FOR LEADING IN CRISIS”: There is nothing quite like a crisis to test your leadership. It will make or break you as a leader. The economic crisis of 2008 was the worst in 80 years. Just a year ago the world’s financial system teetered on the brink of collapse. Starting with the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, things went from bad to worse. Even strong institutions were at risk. This crisis brought down many leaders and their institutions with them. Into that breech stepped two government leaders to save our system: Ben Bernanke of the Federal Reserve and Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson. Facing unprecedented challenges, they were determined to avoid another depression. Many things they tried didn’t work, but they never gave up. Eventually, their actions stabilized financial markets. A year later we are still facing crises over jobs, health care, and the environment, but the financial crisis is largely behind us. No doubt the Monday morning quarterbacks will argue they could have done it all better, avoided the pitfalls and used less government intervention. I disagree. These pundits weren’t in the thick of the battle. We were lucky Paulson and Bernanke were there and had the courage to face reality and continually adapt their strategies to save our system and our country. Like most of us, I don’t like government intervention. But in this case we should be grateful to these determined leaders who were willing to do whatever it took to rescue our country from fiscal destruction. In this crisis, they proved to be great leaders. I’m Bill George.</p><p>To link to webiste:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/nbr/site/onair/transcripts/a_look_at_lenders_in_troubled_times_091027/\">http://www.pbs.org/nbr/site/onair/transcripts/a_look_at_lenders_in_troubled_times_091027/</a></p><a href=\"http://www.pbs.org/nbr/site/onair/transcripts/a_look_at_lenders_in_troubled_times_091027/\">http://www.pbs.org/nbr/site/onair/transcripts/a_look_at_lenders_in_troubled_times_091027/</a>"

What is clear, he says, is that  CIOs need to do everything they can to enable the business. That means  giving all employees the tools they need to reach customers and to  collect and analyze data on their clients.</p><a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">management</a><em><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/c/a/Books/Leaders-Crisis-606211/\">7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis</a></em><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/c/a/Books/Leaders-Crisis-606211/\">7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis</a><p>Part of the battle for CIOs is to communicate IT’s capabilities; but far more important, George says, is to <em>demonstrate</em> that value. George offered a candid look at CIOs and IT from the executive’s viewpoint in a recent conversation with <em>CIO Insight</em> Editor in Chief Brian P. Watson. What follows is an edited, condensed version of that discussion.</p><em>demonstrate</em><em>CIO Insight</em><p><strong>CIO INSIGHT: What’s your perception of IT leaders and what they bring to the table in a crisis?</strong></p><strong>CIO INSIGHT: What’s your perception of IT leaders and what they bring to the table in a crisis?</strong><p>One thing is for sure: When we come out of this crisis, the markets  companies are serving are going to look dramatically different. Take  retail. Yes, it’s true that everyone’s gone to Wal-Mart because it’s the  lowest cost, but large organizations like Niemen Marcus and Saks Fifth  Avenue are struggling.</p><p>A lot of people are hunkering down, saying, “Let’s just get through  this and get back to the good old days of 2006 and 2007.” That’s not  going to happen.</p><p>Progressive companies are trying to get in front of that. Today,  you’ve got to get ahead with IT—there’s no way to get ahead without it.  You can’t just <a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">afford</a> to have full personal coverage—you have to have great customer  information systems and ways for your people and executives to connect  with customers, and for customers to connect with you. It’s a lot more  than having a good Website—it’s being really interactive and using  online tools to do that.</p><a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">afford</a><p>I would think progressive CIOs would be right out in front of that by  showing the business value. How can we build market share? How can we  build a revenue base? How can we connect with our customers to raise  their satisfaction? All of those things are extremely important—not just  to be the back-room people figuring out the techie side.</p><p>Take a company like Apple. Apple has done an amazing job of  connecting people with information. That’s what we want to do at  companies. How do we really hook up to our customers with really good  information? Everything comes down to human factors. Executives don’t  have time to learn all the technical stuff—they just want to be  connected. So how do I use IT to get much more connected with my  customers?</p><p><strong>Is there a deficit in CIOs’ ability to communicate the value of IT to the C-level?</strong></p><strong>Is there a deficit in CIOs’ ability to communicate the value of IT to the C-level?</strong><p>A lot of people talk about how they communicate IT value. I’d rather  see them demonstrate the value. I want to see it in my laptop, my  iPhone. I want to see that value right in front of me. I want to be so  linked up, I want our customer data to be so good.</p><p>Airlines are the least customer-friendly companies in the world, yet  they have great IT systems. But have they taken the next step? They have  great reservation systems, but are they really connecting with me?</p><p>Amazon has some of the best customer information systems and database  management of any company in the world, and they use that to market.  I’ve never met anyone from Amazon, but I do business with them. I do  everything online. My wife wants to get a Kindle, and she asks whom she  can call. I tell her not to bother calling—just do everything online.  Just give me the tools to make me effective.</p><p>Another thing that’s important coming out of this crisis is  globalization. I want to hook up with my customers all over the globe.  How can I connect seamlessly with my customers in Australia? In India?  At Medtronic, we had development teams in Minnesota that worked during  the day, and teams in India that worked off that cycle. So the [Indian  team] uploaded everything when the Americans went home, and when the  workers in Minnesota came back the next morning, everything was done.  That’s the kind of seamless IT I want to have on a global basis, 24/7.</p><p>The third thing is that we’re living in a globally cost-competitive  world. One of the first lessons in my book is, “Face Reality, Starting  With Yourself.” That’s the reality today.</p><p>What are the best ways my company can <a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">save money</a>?  Honestly, not having as many people. How I do that is through IT  productivity. I have fewer salespeople, but they’re more productive  because I’m giving them the right tools to work with. Our quality  systems need to work so well that we don’t have any rework. I can link  up my engineers in 10 different virtual-development locations through  such good IT systems that people can work from home. Sometimes we focus  so much on security that we lose sight of connectivity and ease of  access. We want to make it easy.</p><a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">save money</a><p>These are ways we can use IT to be more competitive. It doesn’t  matter if your name is General Motors or General Electric—business has  to offer better value to customers than your competitors do. If you  can’t, you’ll be out of business.</p><p><strong>Do you agree when the business often says IT takes too long and costs too much? </strong></p><strong>Do you agree when the business often says IT takes too long and costs too much? </strong><p>And that they’re too bureaucratic. But rather than warding those off,  CIOs need to get out in front of them. They need to be leaders. There  are a lot of IT people who are really good implementers, really good  executors—but I’m asking them to be my leader.</p><p><strong>If you were starting a new company, what qualities would you want in your CIO?</strong></p><strong>If you were starting a new company, what qualities would you want in your CIO?</strong><p>Be engaged with the <a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">business</a>.  At Medtronic, we wanted our CIO out seeing pacemaker implants, seeing  procedures, riding with salespeople. Why is that important for a CIO?  Because it helps the CIO understand employees’ lives. You’re there to  support them. That’s the life of the business. How do we make it really  easy for customers? If a doctor is in surgery and something’s going  wrong and he wants to call Medtronic for technical advice, that’s an  urgent thing. You’ve got to have a way for the surgeon to get through to  a person and not go through a bureaucracy.</p><a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">business</a><p>If I’ve seen a fault in my 40 years of working with my IT executives,  it’s that they don’t engage with the business often enough. They engage  with their own—they engage with IT. They have to engage with the head  of sales, the head of research, the head of customer support and say,  “How can I help you?” That’s the level of engagement I would expect. The  CIO should be part of the top executive team, but as a service provider  and not just a <a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">cost</a> center.</p><a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">cost</a><p><strong>So getting out there and building relationships is the most important thing?</strong></p><strong>So getting out there and building relationships is the most important thing?</strong><p>Yes. And then being creative enough to get our company to figure out  how to use the existing technologies and new technologies coming along  not to take the right risk for IT’s sake, but to get us on the leading  edge of changes in the business. If I’m a business executive and I want  to blog or get into Twitter, then show me how. Make it easy for me.</p><p><strong>The best CIOs seem to understand that, especially in this tough economy. But the business seems to have a different perception.</strong></p><strong>The best CIOs seem to understand that, especially in this tough economy. But the business seems to have a different perception.</strong><p>They can tell—is this person here to help me, or sell me something?  Too many CIOs try to sell to the executive team, rather than trying to  help them. If CIOs become advocates, they’ll help. If they try to sell  you, well, the business has gone through that before.</p><p>You can often outsource the execution more efficiently than you can  do it yourself, and not have all the fixed costs in your own people, but  you can’t outsource the essence. You can’t just bring in a consulting  firm to give you a new IT strategy—you have to do that yourself. Then  you can outsource. Who cares who runs the <a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">data center</a>? It doesn’t really matter. What’s important is controlling the essence.</p><a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">data center</a><p><strong>You’re talking about innovation. That’s been another tough  thing for CIOs this year. How should business and IT leaders move from  being in the trenches to preparing for the inevitable upturn?</strong></p><strong>You’re talking about innovation. That’s been another tough  thing for CIOs this year. How should business and IT leaders move from  being in the trenches to preparing for the inevitable upturn?</strong><p>The fifth lesson in the book is, “Never Waste a Good Crisis.” The way  you waste it is to say that everybody is going to get a 15 to 20  percent cutback in expenses, so we’ll just hunker down until we get  through this and restore our <a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">budget</a>. That’s wasting an opportunity.</p><a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">budget</a><p>How do we use the crisis? When people know we have to cut back, how  do we use it to transform the company? If you’re in the travel and  hospitality business, for example, obviously you’ve been hurt badly. How  do you get out in front to become more appealing to your customers?</p><p>Lesson No. 7 is, “Go on Offense, Focus on Winning Now.” You need to  play to your strengths—the company’s, not just IT’s. How can IT help the  company win in the marketplace?</p><p>Too many people are like sailors at sea. When there’s a huge squall,  they take down the sails and go underground and wait for it to pass. I’m  on the board of Exxon-Mobil. Exxon always invests in downturns. When  the price of oil goes down, that’s when they invest—and when they make  their best <a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">investments</a>.  But when they come out of the difficult times, they have the refineries  up and running and the oil exploration up and running. It’s the same  with <a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">Intel</a>. Intel has always invested in downturns.</p><a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">investments</a><a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">Intel</a><p>Motorola didn’t, and now they’re out of the semiconductor business,  and Intel’s going strong. So think about making the investments. Don’t  wait until you come out of it because then it’s too late. You want to  put in a new enterprise system or customer-facing system? That takes  time. You don’t do that overnight.</p><p>Lesson No. 4 is, “Get Ready for the Long Haul.” There’s no  short-term, quick fix. You need to have a long-term plan. You have to  make the investments. The time to make them is now, when everyone else  is in crouch-mode and pulling back. You need to be out in front of the  game leading so you can use those investments to your advantage.</p><p><strong>Back to the disconnect between what business and IT leaders  think about each other. How IT savvy is the current league of business  executives?</strong></p><strong>Back to the disconnect between what business and IT leaders  think about each other. How IT savvy is the current league of business  executives?</strong><p>They’re certainly not IT experts. I think the progressive ones, like  John Chambers at Cisco, are really on top of it. The aggressive ones  really know how to use the technology. John Lechleiter at Eli Lilly is a  research scientist who became CEO. He’s using technology to communicate  with people all around the world. He can’t go see those people all the  time. What if there’s a crisis? How do you get out and tell people? The  progressive executives are using IT to be in touch with people all the  time, in real time.</p><p>The organization of the future is going to look much more like the  Internet than like a military hierarchy. We’re moving steadily away from  the hierarchy, and the faster we move, the better. We need to go to  more of an Internet-type structure, where there’s not just a central  core everything flows out from, but it’s much more interactive between  the nodes and the system. That’s the way people are operating: on a 24/7  basis. It’s that kind of world.</p><p>I’m also on the board of Target. Target has 400,000 employees, mostly  in the U.S. But they have people buying in the Far East and Africa, and  they need to be in instant touch with those people. Why? Because they  want to get goods moved to market faster. If they can get goods in three  weeks and competitors take three months, Target’s going to beat them.  They see trends—they see what’s happening and they see where they need  to move quickly.</p><p>The executives need to be IT savvy to know how it becomes an integral  part of their strategy. A lot of IT executives think of their strategy  for IT. I don’t think they can have one. It’s really about the company’s  strategy to use information for competitive advantage.</p><p><strong>So in this Internet-like structure, where do you see the CIO’s opportunity?</strong></p><strong>So in this Internet-like structure, where do you see the CIO’s opportunity?</strong><p>Part of it is educating their own people. Senior people in the <a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">organization need</a> to be interacting with more junior people that are much more Web-savvy  and tech-savvy than they are. You need that pairing up. It’s not a  question of having your assistant print up your e-mails. That’s absurd.  You have to be out there, you have to have access, and you have to be on  top of everything. Good executives are overstretched—IT has to help  make them more effective. And they’ll get excited about it when they see  that IT really works.</p><a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">organization need</a><p>Lesson No. 6 is, “You’re in the Spotlight: Follow Your True North.”  The word today is “transparency.” Everything is open. That’s why I say  I’m not big on a heavy layer of IT security. That should be hidden from  me—I don’t want to have to fool around with that or change my password  every 30 days. The IT police come to me and say, “Change your password,”  but I can’t keep up with all the passwords.</p><p>If Medtronic has a product problem in Argentina, everyone in the  world knows about it in two hours. You can’t hide. Things that are said  internally go external, and everything said externally is known  internally. There’s no sense fighting it—you can’t shut that down, so  don’t try.</p><p>After 9/11, Rudy Giuliani was there that day. Sometimes you can’t  physically be there, so how do you communicate? If you have a fire in a  plant in Belgium, how do you communicate? Can you use IT tools? Can you  Skype? IT needs to set you up so you can get in touch with the plant  manager and say, “I’m there.”</p><p><strong>Top CIOs, too, say you can’t hide in a crisis.</strong></p><strong>Top CIOs, too, say you can’t hide in a crisis.</strong><p>In the old days, we said, “Lead, follow or get the heck out of the  way.” Well, I’d like to see the IT executive leading me, since I’m not  an IT specialist.</p><p>What’s the biggest waste of time in <a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">business</a>?  Air travel, particularly overseas. If I had a meeting with the minister  of health in China, I’m going to be there. But I can’t just fly over to  China all the time for a two-hour meeting—it takes a week out of my  life to go over there. So why can’t we videoconference? Why can’t I use  IT to help me with that?</p><a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">business</a><p>When I led Medtronic, the head of Europe was on our executive  committee. I didn’t want him to come to Minneapolis for a meeting every  two weeks. I wanted him to be with his customers. So he just would  attend the meeting over videoconference. It’s a six-hour time difference  for him, but you do it. You feel that touch better with tools like  videoconferencing than with picking up a phone. These tools are there,  but a lot of people aren’t using them. I don’t know why.</p><p><strong>You mentioned your board membership. What sort of attention do CIOs and/or IT get from boards?</strong></p><strong>You mentioned your board membership. What sort of attention do CIOs and/or IT get from boards?</strong><p>You don’t see CIOs as often, but you see their work every day.  Goldman Sachs couldn’t survive without these tools. But seeing the  impact of that in a global world—knowing exactly what’s going on at all  times, having their executives know what’s going on so they don’t have  to go to the trading floor—you have to have those tools in your pocket.  The companies that are on the leading edge, like Goldman Sachs, see the  trends. That’s why they were able to avoid the subprime mortgage crisis:  They saw it in early 2007. But if they didn’t have good IT tools, they  would have missed it. Other companies were still investing in subprime  mortgages 18 months later, and Goldman was out. That’s a big advantage.  Timing is everything.</p><p><strong>In your teaching pursuits, do you see any interest in students wanting to be a CIO?</strong></p><strong>In your teaching pursuits, do you see any interest in students wanting to be a CIO?</strong><p>The more common thing is that they want to move back and forth. I had  that back at Honeywell. I had all the computer systems,  telecommunications and everything. It was a way of really getting to  know the company in addition to the other responsibilities I had. It’s  good for people who want to go into general <a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">management</a> to get that experience—and bring that very business-oriented perspective.</p><a href=\"http://www.cioinsight.com/#\" target=\"_blank\">management</a>"

What can be said that hasn’t already been said?</p><a href=\"http://www.adamsmithesq.com/archives/2009/08/confronting-reality-and-other-lessons.html\">written before</a><p>Bill George, a Professor of Management Practice at Harvard Business School and the former chairman and CEO of Medtronic (a medical device maker) has recently published&nbsp;<em>7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis,</em>&nbsp;and since it’s not the typical content-free platitudinous essay on this topic, let’s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6214.html\">take a look</a>&nbsp;and see how his thoughts might translate to BigLaw. Let’s start with the 35,000′ overview and take it from there.</p><em>7 Lessons for Leading in Crisis,</em><a href=\"http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/6214.html\">take a look</a><p>According to George, here are the 7 principles:</p><ol>\n<li>Face reality, starting with yourself.</li>\n<li>Don’t be Atlas; get the world off your shoulders.</li>\n<li>Dig deep for the root cause.</li>\n<li>Get ready for the long haul.</li>\n<li>Never waste a good crisis.</li>\n<li>You’re in the spotlight: follow your True North.</li>\n<li>Go on offense: focus on winning now.</li>\n</ol><li>Face reality, starting with yourself.</li><li>Don’t be Atlas; get the world off your shoulders.</li><li>Dig deep for the root cause.</li><li>Get ready for the long haul.</li><li>Never waste a good crisis.</li><li>You’re in the spotlight: follow your True North.</li><li>Go on offense: focus on winning now.</li><p>He readily concedes that it’s very tough to be (not just to appear) optimistic in the midst of a crisis, particularly one of the uncharted depth and severity of this one: But that’s precisely what could distinguish you. The flip side of this is to avoid falling into the (tempting, and perhaps readily thrust-upon-you by panicky partners) trap of yanking at any and all readily available “quick fix” levers. On the same note, George opines that the current financial crisis was largely caused by what he calls<em>short-termism</em>, CEOs and other leaders who ignored both their own internal “True North” and that of their organization. The opportunity now—perhaps as never before in your career—is to think deliberately and&nbsp;<em>strategically</em>&nbsp;about what the future landscape might hold for your firm.</p><em>short-termism</em><em>strategically</em><p>This is precisely why you need to avoid the “do something quick” mentality that undermines your colleagues’ and clients’ belief in how steadfastly you will adhere to your core principles in the midst of this storm. Two further observations on that:</p><ul>\n<li>You have been, are, and will be in the spotlight as never before. Truly, everyone is looking to see what you say, how you behave, and what you do. They will pick up on signs of reaching hastily or desperately with tremendous acuity and their memory of the reflex you chose to pursue in the crisis will be long.</li>\n<li>Pressure—perhaps intense pressure—will be brought to bear for you to seem as though you are boldly confronting things and that you are demonstrating<em>&nbsp;</em>in the moment that you are capable and deserving of your leadership mantle. There’s only one thing wrong with this: This is not about you. It’s about the firm, the legacy that previous generations have bequeathed to you and the legacy you will be passing on to the next generation. To repeat: This is not about your “saving face.”</li>\n</ul><li>You have been, are, and will be in the spotlight as never before.

In many ways, they don’t&nbsp;<em>expect</em>&nbsp;you to know it all and you will tarnish your credibility if you project otherwise to them.</li>\n</ul><li>Don’t be afraid to admit that you don’t know what you don’t know.</li><li>Be candid and forthcoming with all of your various constituencies. In many ways, they don’t&nbsp;<em>expect</em>&nbsp;you to know it all and you will tarnish your credibility if you project otherwise to them.</li><em>expect</em><p>So if you don’t know everything, what do you do?</p><p>Here’s what George has to say about this dilemma:</p><blockquote>\n<p>One of the great myths of leadership in recent years is that leaders have to appear strong and invulnerable to mistakes and pressures. All of us without exception make mistakes and will capitulate under enough pressure. The key is being open with others, taking them into your confidence, admitting your mistakes, and looking to them for advice and support. Rarely does anyone turn down a leader who genuinely asks for help.</p>\n<p>Yet we’re exposed regularly by the media to the stereotype of the flawless leader who always has an answer and is never left questioning a decision. While most leaders know this is a fantasy, they still struggle with admitting their own vulnerability when a situation goes awry and crisis strikes. It’s as if doing so is tantamount to admitting failure as a leader.</p>\n</blockquote><p>One of the great myths of leadership in recent years is that leaders have to appear strong and invulnerable to mistakes and pressures.

And yet isn’t it what we’ve seen at the root of so many of the behavior syndromes that led to the Great Credit Meltdown? In this connection, perhaps no quote is more memorable, or infamous, than that of former Citigroup CEO Chuck Prince who remarked to the&nbsp;<em>WSJ</em>&nbsp;a few short months before the gale winds began blowing that “As long as the music’s playing, you have to keep dancing. And we’re still dancing.”</p><em>WSJ</em><p>My reaction—perhaps yours—was&nbsp;<em>he said what?</em></p><em>he said what?</em><p>Here’s the leader of one of the (notoriously) too-big-to-fail global financial behemoths announcing to the world that he has set his organization full-speed-ahead towards the iceberg, and he’s trusting that he can pull the ship safely off course at the last second. (Precisely, not to belabor a point, just as the entire rest of the financial world is attempting to do exactly the same thing, leading to the great liquidity freeze which was an essential part of the core of this crisis.) George’s prescription could not be simpler to state or, perhaps, more challenging in the heat of the profit-maximizing moment to live by:</p><blockquote>\n<p>The leaders who successfully navigate their organizations through crises are ones who focused on their leadership principles and stayed true to their values. Only by practicing a clear set of principles can we ensure that the recovery is long-lasting and that future business is sustainable. As a society, we need to get back to practicing values-centered leadership. That’s the only way we can restore integrity to leadership.</p>\n</blockquote><p>The leaders who successfully navigate their organizations through crises are ones who focused on their leadership principles and stayed true to their values.

As a society, we need to get back to practicing values-centered leadership. That’s the only way we can restore integrity to leadership.</p><p>Why is this so difficult?

While Patel’s soft-spoken charm may hide his Rhodes scholar intellect, there is nothing understated about his strikingly ambitious vision for global religious pluralism.</p><p>Patel’s goal is to make interfaith cooperation a social norm within just one generation.</p><p>“Women’s rights are a social norm today,” he says. “Everyone in America should challenge religious prejudice just like we challenge racial and gender prejudice.”</p><p>His passion for interfaith cooperation was shaped by childhood experiences that were anything but cooperative. A Muslim born in India, Patel grew up in Chicago. When he ran for seventh-grade student council, a white classmate told him, “Nobody would vote for people like you.” Locker-room humiliation and peer taunts of “curry maker”—and worse—marked his adolescence. In his searching memoir&nbsp;<em>Acts of&nbsp;Faith,</em>&nbsp;he recalls the elements in his own background that might have led him to religious violence: “a gut-wrenching feeling of being excluded from mainstream society .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a vague sense of being Muslim .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. a growing consciousness that people with whom I shared an identity were being horribly treated elsewhere, often by people who looked just like the ones who were bullying me here.” He still feels the shame of not defending a Jewish friend by confronting a group of thugs who scrawled anti-Semitic slurs on classroom desks.</p><em>Acts of&nbsp;Faith,</em><p>While studying at the University of Illinois, he recognized that his heroes—leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., Mahatma Gandhi, Nelson Mandela, and Aga Khan—led through common principles of faith, although they practiced different faiths. These early experiences with racism, religious prejudice, and rejection caused Patel to question why religion causes such violence around the world. Why do some champion religious pluralism while others become suicide bombers?</p><p>By digging deeply into his own life story, Patel recognized that the people and programs he had encountered shaped his identity and that of other young people as well. He concluded that the only way to overcome destructive religious fanaticism is to create communities where human connection transcends differences of race,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/best-leaders/2009/10/22/eboo-patel-obama-faith-adviser-preaches-religious-tolerance.html\" target=\"undefined\">religion</a>, and culture. “I recognize now that believing in pluralism means having the courage to act on it,” he says. “Action is what separates belief from merely an opinion.”</p><a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/best-leaders/2009/10/22/eboo-patel-obama-faith-adviser-preaches-religious-tolerance.html\" target=\"undefined\">religion</a><p>His personal transformation infused Patel with the passion to seek a new generation of advocates for cooperation. In 1998, he founded the Interfaith Youth Core, designed to inspire and train college students to build understanding. Patel says college campuses should be “models of interfaith cooperation.”</p><p><strong>Empowered.&nbsp;</strong>In a decade, IYC has grown into a national movement with a presence at 140 universities. It trains students on college campuses to become empowered advocates for religious pluralism. Instead of setting up service projects, IFC encourages students to do so themselves.</p><strong>Empowered.&nbsp;</strong><p>In the past year, Patel, 33, has become a leading voice for embracing religious pluralism. He writes “The Faith Divide,” a featured column for the&nbsp;<em>Washington</em>&nbsp;<em>Post.</em>&nbsp;In February, Obama appointed him to the White House Office of Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships, giving him the platform to push the president to discuss interfaith issues more prominently (as he gently chides Obama for not acknowledging his Muslim heritage). The president appears to be listening. In his Cairo speech in June, Obama addressed the common principles of America and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/best-leaders/2009/10/22/eboo-patel-obama-faith-adviser-preaches-religious-tolerance.html\" target=\"undefined\">Islam</a>: “justice and progress; tolerance and the dignity of all human beings.”</p><em>Washington</em><em>Post.</em><a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/best-leaders/2009/10/22/eboo-patel-obama-faith-adviser-preaches-religious-tolerance.html\" target=\"undefined\">Islam</a><p>Patel recognizes that it is no small task to move America to a place of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/best-leaders/2009/10/22/eboo-patel-obama-faith-adviser-preaches-religious-tolerance.html\" target=\"undefined\">religious&nbsp;tolerance</a>.

The cover price is $19.95, although barnesandnoble.com is pre-selling the book for $14.96.</p><p>George said publishers never competed for him before, so he was writing the book at the same time he was personally negotiating a book deal.</p><p>He ended up with Jossey-Bass, an imprint of Hoboken, N.J.-based John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., the same company that published his first three books, mostly because the firm was willing to promote it heavily.</p><p>“They a made a commitment to make it their lead book for the entire Wiley operation this fall,” he said.</p><p>The publisher started with 50,000 copies – twice as many as it started with for George’s previous books.</p><p>“Initial orders are very strong,” he said.</p><p>George tried to hurry it into publication because he believes that the country is still very much in a crisis now.</p><p>“We’ve gone through the eye of the storm,” he said. “But I think the jobs crisis and many others are really just heating up.”</p><p>The book isn’t intended to be a retrospective of what went wrong. Instead, it is meant to be a look forward at what leaders can learn from this crisis so they don’t repeat the same mistakes, George said. The target audience is top executives, emerging leaders and people just starting out their careers.</p><p>The hardest step for most CEOs is the first one in the book — facing reality, which George illustrates with his own experiences dealing with a product recalls at Litton Industries, a Minneapolis microwave company, early in his career. He used many other executives’ stories as well to highlight examples of good and bad leadership during crisis. He said he mostly drew on second-hand accounts and news stories for these examples; there’s a five page list of references in the back of the book.</p><p>The six other lessons in the book are:</p><h5>No. 2 Don’t be Atlas: Get the world off your shoulders</h5><h5>No. 3 Dig deep for the root cause</h5><h5>No. 4 Get ready for the long haul</h5><h5>No. 5 Never waste a good crisis</h5><h5>No. 6 You’re in the spotlight: Follow True North</h5><h5>No. 7 Go on offense, focus on winning now</h5><p>To help promote 7 Lessons, George will host a free business event called Summit on Leading in a Crisis on Sept. 17 from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. at the Ted Mann Theater at the University of Minnesota. George will moderate a panel with CNN commentator David Gergen; Anne Mulcahy, chair and former CEO of Xerox Corp.; John Donahoe, president and CEO of eBay Inc.; and Marilyn Carlson Nelson, chair and former Carlson Cos.

      "<p><strong>Pershing Square Capital Management LP</strong>‘s William Ackman is waging a proxy fight against&nbsp;<strong>Target Corp.</strong>&nbsp;to replace four of the company’s independent directors with four of his loyalists and himself. Ironically, Ackman is attacking Target’s three greatest strengths: governance, integrated merchandising, and value creation.</p><strong>Pershing Square Capital Management LP</strong><strong>Target Corp.</strong><p>Ackman has chosen the wrong Target.</p><p>Having served on Target’s board from 1993 to 2005, I can attest to the independence of the board, its financial discipline, and its commitment to sustained increases in shareholder value.</p><p>Let’s examine Target’s record in each of the areas Ackman is challenging:</p><p><em>Board governance.</em>&nbsp;Ever since the Dayton family, led by former CEO Kenneth Dayton, took their company public in 1967, Target has been known for its superior board governance. Dayton’s 1984 Harvard Business Review article became the national model for governance and the basis for many provisions in the Sarbanes-Oxley bill. Twenty-five years later Target’s board governance principles remain essentially unchanged, and its board is consistently ranked one of the best in the U.S.</p><em>Board governance.</em><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Ackman has picked an odd target in attempting to replace the Target board. It is one of the strongest, most committed boards in the country. In order to reflect the diversity of its customer base, Target’s eleven independent directors comprise four women and three minorities, with CEO Gregg Steinhafel as the only inside director.</p><p>Ackman is off base in suggesting that the Target board lacks relevant expertise, with no CEO-level expertise in retail, credit cards and real estate. Target’s board includes financial experts with real estate and credit card expertise like Richard Kovacevich of&nbsp;<strong>Wells Fargo &amp; Co.</strong>&nbsp;and Jim Johnson of&nbsp;<strong>Fannie Mae</strong>, and marketing experts&nbsp;<strong>General Mills Inc.</strong>‘s Steve Sanger,&nbsp;<strong>McDonald’s Corp.</strong>‘s Mary Dillon, and&nbsp;<strong>Coca-Cola Co.</strong>‘s Mary Minnick.</p><strong>Wells Fargo &amp; Co.</strong><strong>Fannie Mae</strong><strong>General Mills Inc.</strong><strong>McDonald’s Corp.</strong><strong>Coca-Cola Co.</strong><p>In the last fifteen years the wisdom and unity of the board has guided the company through economic downturns, successful CEO successions, the timely and profitable spinoff of&nbsp;<strong>Marshall Field’s</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Mervyn’s LLC</strong>, and expansion of Target stores into a national franchise.</p><strong>Marshall Field’s</strong><strong>Mervyn’s LLC</strong><p>Why would shareholders want to destroy the board’s independence with directors loyal to Ackman, rather than to all of Target’s shareholders?</p><p><em>Integrated merchandising.</em>&nbsp;Thanks to the merchandising genius of former CEO Bob Ulrich and current CEO Steinhafel, Target has emerged as the only mass merchant to compete successfully with<strong>&nbsp;Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</strong>&nbsp;During his 14 years as CEO, Ulrich was the nation’s most successful retail executive, with Steinhafel as his top merchandising expert.</p><em>Integrated merchandising.</em><strong>&nbsp;Wal-Mart Stores Inc.</strong><p>Target’s retail strategies have been successful because they meticulously integrate retail, real estate and credit cards into consumer-friendly, family-focused offerings. Management carefully controlled real estate to ensure it could execute without compromise its “big box” retail layouts. The Target credit card became an integral part of its merchandising offerings, including contributions of one percent of purchases to customer’s local schools. Were Target to follow Ackman’s recommendations, it risks losing control over its real estate and credit cards, and hence its merchandising strategy.</p><p><em>Shareholder value creation.</em>&nbsp;Target shares have gained 630% since Ulrich was elected CEO in 1994, compared with 280% for arch-rival Wal-Mart. The record speaks for itself.</p><em>Shareholder value creation.</em><p>Enter Ackman, who began buying Target shares in March 2007 just before the market peaked. He immediately began pressuring the Target board to engage in financial engineering by spinning off its credit cards and its real estate. His proposals ignored the lessons of failed retailers like Sears, K-Mart, and Mervyn’s that fell by the wayside after they made similar moves. The board agreed to sell 47% of its credit card business to&nbsp;<strong>J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.</strong>&nbsp;Then Ackman insisted that Target spin off its real estate with very high rent costs. The Target board concluded that implementing Ackman’s plans would put its balance sheet in jeopardy.</p><strong>J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.</strong><p>That’s when Ackman launched his proxy fight and began attacking Target’s board. His motivations in trying to take over the board are questionable. He has disappointed his investors, as he has lost 50% in one Target fund and 90% in another. Is the proxy fight his attempt to save face?</p><p>This isn’t the first time outsiders have taken a run at Target. In 1987 the Dart Group launched an unsuccessful attack on the company, and in 1995 J.C. Penney Co. also did.</p><p>If we have learned anything from the recent economic meltdown, it is that financial engineering strategies like those advocated by Ackman rarely create long-term, sustainable shareholder value. Target is an example of the best of American business, the kind of innovative, customer-oriented company we need to rebuild our economy. If Ackman won’t back off voluntarily, Target shareholders should sent a strong message by soundly defeating his slate.</p><p><em>Bill George, the former CEO of Medtronic, is professor of management practice at Harvard Business School.

People without jobs, or those who fear they will lose their job, are not going to start spending again in this deep recession, no matter how much liquidity exists or how low interest rates are. However, unlocking the credit system so new companies can be formed and existing companies can start investing again is vital to creating new jobs.</p><em>Bill George</em><p align=\"justify\">The economy is going to get worse before it gets better, so optimists shouldn’t play up stabilization until the economy finds its bottom. There are many layoffs ahead that will swell the unemployment rolls. Eventually, the massive amounts of money the government is pumping into the economy will take hold and the economy will gradually begin to turn upward again, but this won’t happen until the end of 2009 at the earliest.</p><p align=\"justify\">The Congress, much more so than the Obama administration, is guilty of playing its old games of pitting social programs against tax cuts. In this crisis, both Democrats and Republicans should set aside their fights and focus entirely on creating jobs. The Obama administration is crying out for at least one businessperson—someone who has made a payroll—to advise the president to point out the enormous difference between saving jobs and creating new ones. The White House needs to focus on the latter, because saving jobs that are no longer viable only slows the retooling required in our economy.</p><p><strong>Commentary</strong>&nbsp;<em>Posted By: RO in Reno</em>&nbsp;@ 04/03/2009 9:02:47 AM<br><em>Good article we can hope Obama reads and heeds it.<br>In an economy that has some 24 million unemployed the objective should be the creation of 24 million sustainable jobs.<br>Bill George put it best.<br>All this hoopla over saving the banks is at best shortsighted, and the Republican mantra of tax cuts for the wealthy to save the middle class is idiotic if not insane.</em></p><strong>Commentary</strong><em>Posted By: RO in Reno</em><br><em>Good article we can hope Obama reads and heeds it.<br>In an economy that has some 24 million unemployed the objective should be the creation of 24 million sustainable jobs.<br>Bill George put it best.<br>All this hoopla over saving the banks is at best shortsighted, and the Republican mantra of tax cuts for the wealthy to save the middle class is idiotic if not insane.</em><br><br><br><p><em>The effort should be to create the small businesses that would lead the way to the “retooling” of America Mr. George commented on; although it may well be reinventing America.</em></p><em>The effort should be to create the small businesses that would lead the way to the “retooling” of America Mr. George commented on; although it may well be reinventing America.</em><p><em>Small business and by that I mean businesses that are less than 10 or 20 employees, are the businesses that can compete with Chinese workers.

If I land at 8 a.m., meditation gives me an opportunity to get deep rest and refocus before my board meeting at 10.”</p><p>Like George, Bob Shapiro, former Monsanto Co. chief executive, also meditates regularly.

During his time as chief executive officer at   <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=MDT:US\">Medtronic Inc.</a> he encouraged employees to give it a try. One of the company’s conference rooms was dedicated for sitting, giving employees the opportunity to take a mental break during their busy days.</p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=MDT:US\">Medtronic Inc.</a><p>“Meditation has been integral in my career; it is the single best thing that happened to me in terms of my leadership,” says George, who also sits on the supervisory boards of   <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=XOM:US\">Exxon Mobil Corp.</a> and   <a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=NOVN:VX\">Novartis AG</a> and is a professor of management practices at <a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Business School</a>. “Meditation enables one to focus on what is really important; and I haven’t had high blood pressure since the 1970s.”</p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=XOM:US\">Exxon Mobil Corp.</a><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=NOVN:VX\">Novartis AG</a><a href=\"http://www.hbs.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Business School</a><p>Shapiro, 70, chief executive of Monsanto until the company’s acquisition by Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Inc. in March 2000, started to hit the cushion in the mid-1990s after talking to an old college friend from Harvard and practicing meditator. Soon after, Shapiro sent out an e-mail, inviting employees to a two-day silent meditation retreat.</p><p>Ton of Burnout</p><p>“As a business person, I noticed a number of people I knew pretty well who really picked up on it, people who perhaps had come into it with some degree of skepticism and found the experience useful,” Shapiro says.</p><p>Shapiro subsequently dedicated rooms at Monsanto for employees to take time for sitting and contemplation.</p><p>Meditation in corporate America should maybe be more than an expression of an executive’s good will or personal interest. Companies lose an estimated $300 billion annually to lowered productivity, absenteeism, health care and related costs stemming from stress, according to a study by the <a href=\"http://www.stress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">American Institute of Stress</a>. Stress-related ailments account for upwards of 60 percent of all doctor visits, according to the study.</p><a href=\"http://www.stress.org/\" target=\"_blank\">American Institute of Stress</a><p>“The stress right now is enormous; how it’ll manifest has yet to be seen but I am sure there’ll be a ton of burnout,” says Herbert Benson, associate professor of medicine at <a href=\"http://hms.harvard.edu/hms/home.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Medical School</a>. “Without question, this is the most important time for these types of practices.”</p><a href=\"http://hms.harvard.edu/hms/home.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Harvard Medical School</a><p>Meditating Googlers</p><p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GOOG:US\">Google Inc.</a> has recognized the advantages of eastern traditions. The owner of the world’s most popular Internet search engine has had regular meditation sits for the past two years at its London, Pittsburgh, Mountain View, California, Sydney and New York locations. In addition, the company in October 2007 initiated a “search inside yourself” meditation and mindfulness course.</p><a href=\"http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/quote?ticker=GOOG:US\">Google Inc.</a><p>“Emotional intelligence is a crucial skill in life, and it’s as important at Google as anywhere else I can think of,” says Peter Allen, director at Google University, in an e-mailed response. “Increasing our self-awareness and our emotional intelligence helps us do things better.”</p><p>Deepak Chopra</p><p>Even Cheetos maker Frito-Lay turned to some non-western ways.

      "<p><em>Originally posted in the <a href=\"http://www.directorship.com/the-best-in-boardroom-intelligence/\">Directorship</a> on September 1, 2008.</em></p><em>Originally posted in the <a href=\"http://www.directorship.com/the-best-in-boardroom-intelligence/\">Directorship</a> on September 1, 2008.</em><a href=\"http://www.directorship.com/the-best-in-boardroom-intelligence/\">Directorship</a><p>From The Bible to biography, the editors of <em>Directorship</em> spent part of the summer distilling the essence of printed wisdom into a  collection of classic works that we believe are as useful in the  boardroom as they are in the study. First, the absolutes that no library  would be complete without: Sun Tzu’s <em>The Art of War</em>, The Bible, and the complete works of the boardroom bard, Shakespeare.</p><em>Directorship</em><em>The Art of War</em><p>In its own timeless way, each work provides useful insights into the  logistical, ethical, and emotional complexities of leadership. And if  you want to glean insights into the mysteries of human nature,  Shakespeare has no equal. For instance, want to know when the Bard  predicts the credit crisis will end? “Tomorrow, tomorrow, and tomorrow.”  And what the regulators are reminding us of now: “All that glisters is  not gold.” Finally, the verdict on boards and management: “Lord, what  fools these mortals be!” But there are other works that our editors also  deemed to be eminently worthy of consideration.</p><p><em>Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</em> by Edwin Lefevre (1923) is  the fictionalized biography of Jesse Livermore, a manipulator who was  perhaps the original rogue trader and who operated in the wild days at  the turn of the 19th century before regulation. Lefevre was among the  first business writers to combine a riveting story with a lifetime of  practical business and market lessons.</p><em>Reminiscences of a Stock Operator</em><p><em>The Intelligent Investor: A Book of Practical Counsel</em> by  Benjamin Graham (1949). Warren Buffett called it “by far the best book  on investing ever written.” We can’t do better than that.</p><em>The Intelligent Investor: A Book of Practical Counsel</em><p><em>The Great Crash of 1929</em> by John Kenneth Galbraith (1955) is  as concise as it is insightful, and has never gone out of print. Why?  “Every time it has been about to pass from print,” the late Galbraith  himself wrote in 1997, “another speculative bubble…has stirred interest  in the history of this, the great modern case of boom and collapse.”</p><em>The Great Crash of 1929</em><p><em>The Effective Executive</em> by Peter Drucker (1966). As Fortune  magazine wrote in a 2005 “smartest books” list: “Before you can manage  anyone else, you’ve got to learn to manage yourself. In this slim  volume, Drucker tells you how.” The original management guru’s lessons  are, like most of the works listed here, timeless.</p><em>The Effective Executive</em><p><em>The Go-Go Years: The Drama and Crashing Finale of Wall Street’s Bullish 60s</em> by the late New Yorker writer John Brooks (1973) examines the 1960s  mutualfund boom and is, to quote a cover testimonial provided by  Galbraith, “a small classic in the history of financial insanity.”</p><em>The Go-Go Years: The Drama and Crashing Finale of Wall Street’s Bullish 60s</em><p><em>In Search of Excellence</em> by Thomas Peters and Robert H.  Waterman (1982) is worth reading for the chance to consider what made  some once-great firms disappear (Digital Equipment, Wang Labs) and  others (GE, Wal-Mart) carry on.</p><em>In Search of Excellence</em><p><em>Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco</em> by Bryan  Burrough and John Helyar (1990) reads with all the suspense of a mystery  and was praised in its time for having “all the stuff of great business  journalism: skullduggery, cigars, trophy wives, and enough greed to  sink Wall Street.” Made into a movie, it launched a new genre: the  business thriller with CEOs cast as either imbeciles or bad guys.</p><em>Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall of RJR Nabisco</em><p>“A big, hairy, audacious goal,” a phrase coined in <em>Built to Last</em> by James Collins and Jerry I. Porras (1994), also applies to the story.  The writers research and find what makes great companies great and tell  the success stories of such firms as Boeing, Deloitte &amp; Touche, and  Sony. Another nugget they dispense: be a clockmaker, not a timekeeper.</p><em>Built to Last</em><p>Here’s a question: Why read about Buffett when you can read Buffett?  While the sage has never written a book, Lawrence Cunningham compiled  the best of Buffett’s annual shareholder letters from 1976 to 1996 into <em>The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America </em>(1997). Take notes.</p><em>The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America </em><p>If there is to be just one memoir, make it Katherine Graham’s <em>Personal History</em> (1997). Thrust reluctantly by the death of her husband to the top of  The Washington Post Co., she tells the story of how an immensely wealthy  but sheltered, naive, shy, stay-at-home mom became the most powerful  woman in American journalism. It is profound in the questions it raises  about overcoming one’s perceived personal limitations. She’s surrounded  by a superb cast of brilliant editors, friends, rogues, business  leaders, and politicians.</p><em>Personal History</em><p>The “tipping point” is when fads turn to trends. (Today it’s known as  viral marketing.) Writer Malcolm Gladwell illustrates the phenomenon by  showing us what best-selling novels, crime waves, and yawning have in  common in <em>The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</em> (2000).</p><em>The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</em><p>Roger Lowenstein’s clear writing style serves readers well whether they’re reading his bio of Buffett; his most recent work, <em>“As America Aged;”</em> or his classic: <em>When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management</em> (2000).</p><em>“As America Aged;”</em><em>When Genius Failed: The Rise and Fall of Long-Term Capital Management</em><p>Risk managers take note: Hedge-fund manager turned author Nassim  Nicholas Taleb claims it’s impossible to understand or predict markets.  In <em>Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in  the Markets he argues that it all comes down to luck. He continued the  creed last year with <em>The Black Swan</em>, destined to become another modern classic. </em></p><em>Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in  the Markets he argues that it all comes down to luck.

Houghton, chairman emeritus of  Corning Inc.</p><p>They were asked to remain “to help ensure an orderly  transition and provide for additional continuity,” said board Chairman  and Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson in a written response to  questions.</p><p>An Exxon spokesman said he didn’t know when they would  depart, and members of the board didn’t respond to requests for comment  or referred questions to Exxon management.</p><p>Fully half of Exxon’s directors, including Mr.  Tillerson, have been on the board for four years or less. The average  tenure of the independent board members is seven years, the lowest level  since before the merger of Exxon and Mobil Oil.</p><p>While it isn’t clear whether the newcomers will push  for any substantial strategy changes, the sheer number of new members is  likely to bring new perspectives.</p><p>“On a typical board, if you have a new member once in a  blue moon, that member tends not to be able to move the board,” said  Stephen Davis, a project director at the Yale University Millstein  Center for Corporate Governance and Performance. “There is not enough  clout to re-examine entrenched assumptions. But if you have a critical  mass, all bets are off.”</p><p>Some of the relative newcomers are clearly already  powerful. William George, a Harvard University professor who joined the  board in 2005, recently became chair of the compensation committee. This  makes him one of two board members who alternates as the presiding  director (the other is Mr. Shipley).</p><p>Mr. George succeeds William R. Howell, the former chief  executive of J.C. Penney Co., who turned 72 years old this year and  retired from the board after 25 years.</p><p>Asked if he thought the new directors would take a  fresh look at issues before the company, Mr. Tillerson replied,  “Directors are called upon at all times to use their expertise and  experience in all matters relating to Board affairs.”</p><p>One change being weighed by the board is how many  employees should serve as directors. Traditionally, the Exxon board has  had two employee directors, but the retirement of Senior Vice President  J. Stephen Simon this year triggered his departure from the board,  leaving only Mr. Tillerson, the CEO.</p><p>The board is currently discussing whether to stay with a  single employee director, which would put Exxon in step with the  majority of U.S. corporations.</p>"

Elected CEO in 1991, he became one  of the most admired CEOs of his generation as he grew Medtronic’s market  capitalization from $1.1 billion to $60 billion, averaging 35% a year  from 1996 to 2002. He then became one of the world’s foremost teachers  of leadership, as a Harvard Professor and best-selling author.</p><p>Most leaders, says George in <em>True North</em> (the follow-up to his book <em>Authentic Leadership</em>)  , act the way they think a leader should act, based on leader  archetypes (think Churchill, Jack Welch), or the traits, styles and  characteristics that have been identified in more than 1,000 studies of  leadership over the past fifty years. But, those who see leadership as  emulating great leaders or acting out a set of competencies don’t truly  lead, says George. You can only effectively lead by finding your  authentic voice.  </p><em>True North</em><em>Authentic Leadership</em><p><strong><em>“In the 21st century, without authenticity in leadership,<br> organizations can’t develop sustained growth.”</em></strong></p><strong><em>“In the 21st century, without authenticity in leadership,<br> organizations can’t develop sustained growth.”</em></strong><em>“In the 21st century, without authenticity in leadership,<br> organizations can’t develop sustained growth.”</em><br><p>For  George, leadership isn’t a job title, or a mantle that you put on when  you walk into a leadership position, or a set of behaviours defined in  your HR Department’s leadership competencies framework. It is the sum  total of who you are.</p><p><strong>Leadership Is About What Makes You Different </strong></p><strong>Leadership Is About What Makes You Different </strong><p>Finding  your authentic leadership is the leader’s equivalent of what the  business guru Tom Peters calls ‘defining Brand You’. While most  leadership theory is spent on codifying what is the same about  leadership, George reminds us what the marketplace itself teaches us –  sameness creates commodities, difference is what stands out. </p><p>No-one  can be authentic by trying to be like someone else. One of the 125  leaders George interviewed to define authentic leadership used to be  Jack Welch’s assistant at GE in the 1980s. Everyone was running around  trying to be like Jack, he explained. Nobody could take that seriously.  You need to be who you are, not try to emulate someone else.</p><p>Reminds  me of my favourite quote about all leadership being autobiography:  “Abraham Lincoln was once asked how long it took him to write The  Gettysburg Address, the speech that defined a nation. He replied,  ‘All  my life’.”</p><p><strong>There Is No Perfect Profile Of A Leader</strong></p><strong>There Is No Perfect Profile Of A Leader</strong><p>All  the academic studies have failed to find the profile of a perfect  leader, says George, because leaders are highly complex human beings,  people who have distinctive qualities that cannot be sufficiently  described by lists or traits or characteristics. Once we realise this,  says George, and also realise that leadership is not a position, we can  stop being bent out of shape by trying to fit into the straitjacket of  leadership definitions and instead accept four liberating new laws of  leadership:</p><p>1.    You do not have to be born with the characteristics of a leader<br>2.    You do not have to wait for a tap on the shoulder<br>3.    You do not have to be at the top of your organization<br>4.    You can step up and lead at any point in your life</p><br><br><br><p><strong>The Five Dimensions Of Authentic Leadership</strong></p><strong>The Five Dimensions Of Authentic Leadership</strong><p>Traditional  leaders focus on their own success and on getting loyal subordinates to  follow them to achieve that success. Authentic leaders, by contrast,  inspire others to lead around a shared purpose, rather than around the  leader. </p><p>This doesn’t mean authentic leaders are perfect. In  fact, it is a defining feature of authenticity that you admit to your  flaws rather than hide behind the mystique of the leader who can never  make a mistake.</p><p><strong>George’s research shows there are five dimensions to an authentic leader</strong></p><strong>George’s research shows there are five dimensions to an authentic leader</strong><p><strong>1.    Purpose:</strong> Without knowing your purpose (why you lead) you are at the mercy of ego<br><strong>2.    Practising solid values:</strong> Integrity is the core value. If your practice slips and slides under  pressure, people quickly lose confidence in your leadership<br><strong>3.    Heart:</strong> This means having passion for your work and the courage to make difficult decisions<br><strong>4.    Relationships:</strong> Authentic leaders develop enduring relationships<br><strong>5.    Self-discipline: </strong>Setting  high standards, taking responsibility for outcomes, and holding others  accountable for their performance, takes strong self-discipline</p><strong>1.    Purpose:</strong><br><strong>2.    Practising solid values:</strong><br><strong>3.    Heart:</strong><br><strong>4.    Relationships:</strong><br><strong>5.    Self-discipline: </strong><p align=\"center\"><strong>Critique of True North and its interpretation of ‘authentic’ </strong></p><strong>Critique of True North and its interpretation of ‘authentic’ </strong><p>According  to George, an authentic leader has found his or her inner voice and  remains true to it. This is Warren Bennis stuff, for anyone who’s read  Bennis. And it’s no surprise True North is part of the ‘Warren Bennis  Signature Series’ imprint. George echoes the Dean of Leadership (as the  FT calls Bennis), when he says that true authentic leaders have commonly  been through an extremely tough experience that reveals their true  nature to themselves – the death of a loved one, bankruptcy, overcoming  serious illness. </p><p>Bennis observed that authentic leaders are  often forged in the crucible of overcoming adversity, whether as a child  or later in their career. This echoes Hemingway’s “The world breaks all  of us. But some are strong at the broken places.” And it plays to the  heroic, romantic leadership model, even if unintentionally.</p><p>We  tend to have an archetype in our head of leaders as infallible, certain  of where they are going, moving from success to success. Even George’s  phrase ‘True North’ reinforces that image. But, great leaders –  authentic leaders – often don’t feel that way when they are in the  middle of achieving great things. </p><p>Anne Mulcahy, the CEO credited  with rescuing Xerox from its downward spiral, is a case in point. The  emotional roller coaster of trying to keep people at Xerox motivated and  pull the company back from the brink was so draining that, at one  point, Mulcahy described to George, she was on the way home, drained,  and had to pull over to the side of the road. She sat there, temporarily  unable to move, and said to herself, “I don’t know where to go. I don’t  want to go home. There’s just no place to go.”</p><p>The boxer Jack  Dempsey once supposedly said champions get up when they can’t. Dempsey  would have said, Mulcahey ‘got up when she couldn’t’. And she is now  widely praised as the woman who saved Xerox (a claim she would herself  deny, as she credits a lot of people at Xerox with saving the company).  That’s the test of an authentic leader, says George.</p><p>And, of  course it applies to people at all levels, not just the top of an  organisation. You lead your own life by refusing to be knocked out of  shape and by getting up when you are knocked down. </p><p>The  over-riding impression of an ‘authentic leader’ from True North is of a  leader in George’s own image: he was a brilliant, empathetic leader at  Medtronic (inventor of the pacemaker), which he grew by encouraging  leadership at all levels, driven by the higher purpose of saving lives.  The 125 leaders he profiled for his research into authentic leaders tend  to be like that, too, kind of tough but fair benevolent teacher/leader  figures.</p><p>Which raises the question: is an apparently autocratic,  empathy-lite leader such as the UK’s Alan Sugar or Rupert Murdoch an  authentic leader? Of course they are, in the sense that they are honest  and true to themselves. What you see is what you get. But, I’m not sure  either of them have been through the deep inner journey of enlightenment  and understanding self and others that Bill George says is necessary to  be an authentic leader.</p><p>Nor does being authentic mean being nice,  though George tends towards analyzing leaders in this book who exhibit  his own traits: nice, empathetic, challenging, values-driven. So, just  as all leadership is autobiography, <em><strong>True North </strong></em>and <em><strong>Authentic Leadership</strong></em> can be seen as tinged with George’s own autobiography.</p><em><strong>True North </strong></em><strong>True North </strong><em><strong>Authentic Leadership</strong></em><strong>Authentic Leadership</strong><p>I once heard Tom Peters, in the middle of a rant about how wrong Jim Collins (author of <em>Good To Great</em>)  is to champion quiet, ‘ego lite’ leaders, suddenly break off and say,  as an aside, “The older I get the more convinced I become that whatever  we think we are writing about, we are writing about ourselves.” That is  searingly honest and insightful.</p><em>Good To Great</em><p>The famously charismatic and  shout-y Peters champions loud and proud and colourful leaders with big  personalities (like, er, himself).  The quietly-spoken,  introspective,  Collins champions quietly-spoken, introspective, non ego driven leaders.  Therefore their research, and the people they hold up as  objectively-discovered great leaders that just happen to emerge from the  research (Collins at least) clearly aren’t as objectively discovered   as they would like to think.  There appears to be a good deal of  projection going on.</p><p>Similarly, George tends to equate ‘authentic’  leadership with his own type of caring (but demanding: that’s how he  achieved results at Medtronic) leadership. I think it would be  interesting to study equally authentic ‘not nice’ leaders, often those  who appear to be driven by ego and the need to win.  Is Rupert Murdoch  an authentic leader? Of course he is, as he is true to himself. Is he  nice to work for? That’s a different question. Does he shape News  International in his own image, rather than aligning people behind a  shared set of universal values they all buy into? Of course he does.  Ego-driven and Authentic aren’t mutually exclusive, whereas George  fudges the logic a bit and seems to conclude they are. I wish they were.  But, I’m not convinced of it.</p><p align=\"center\"><strong>Background: How Bill George led Medtronic : “From ‘I’ to ‘We'”<br></strong></p><strong>Background: How Bill George led Medtronic : “From ‘I’ to ‘We'”<br></strong><br><p><em><strong>This isn’t in the book: I researched it separately as it makes useful background before you read the book. </strong></em></p><em><strong>This isn’t in the book: I researched it separately as it makes useful background before you read the book. </strong></em><strong>This isn’t in the book: I researched it separately as it makes useful background before you read the book. </strong><p>George  received his BSc in industrial engineering from Georgia Tech, and MBA  from Harvard. His early career was spent as an executive with Honeywell  and Litton Industries, and he served in the US Department of Defense. </p><p> His definition of leadership involves developing the organization so  that passion and inspiration are built into the system, not merely  dependent on the CEO, an objective he put to the test by setting himself  a ten-year term limit as CEO of Medtronic. His strategy for embedding  leadership proved to be right, as Medtronic’s growth path is just as  strong today, when it stands at 222nd largest company in the US by  market capitalisation, up from 349th in the year George stepped down.</p><p>George  says the key to effective leadership today is in the transformation  from ‘I’ to ‘We’, which he put into practice at Medtronic, inventor of  the pacemaker. This involves focussing on the leadership of others, to  embed leadership in the system. At Medtronic, people at all levels –  30,000 employees – were shown how to link what they do every day with  the company’s core purpose, so they could take the lead in their own  jobs. The first thing George himself did on joining the company was to  don a surgical gown and spend 120 days watching procedures like open  heart surgery, to learn how the company’s products could be improved. </p><p>George  spotted early on that the company lacked a closed-loop performance  management system and the ability to execute plans on schedule. For  instance, it took Medtronic four years to bring a new pacemaker to  market where competitors were doing it in two. Under George’s  stewardship, that time was cut to 16 months. </p><p>George also  discovered that Medtronic had individuals who were incredibly  knowledgeable about the business but who lacked critical leadership  skills. The company had grown up faster than the leadership teams. So he  gave some people who were great functional managers the opportunity to  hold leadership roles. He created the ‘Medtronic Fellows’ programme, for  high-potential leaders to go to business school.</p><p><strong>Leadership Demands Accountability And High Performance</strong></p><strong>Leadership Demands Accountability And High Performance</strong><p>To  ensure strategy execution, George was ruthless on performance. At first  this confused employees – he talked about empowering them as leaders,  but came down hard when they didn’t hit deadlines. With ‘empowered’  local leadership comes the responsibility to perform, and George was  relentless in driving this home. He met bi-monthly or monthly with  business groups, travelling across the US and around the world to meet  them rather than bringing them to head office, to review performance.  George also led a worldwide reorganization away from multilayered  management to structure around business units, bringing the organization  closer to customers.</p><p>Known for his integrity and authenticity,  George has translated his experience into a practical values-based  leadership that delivers results. His research at Harvard Business  School into 125 successful leaders helped him codify Authentic  Leadership, as he calls it, leading to the creation of Harvard’s MBA in  Authentic Leadership, which he teaches. </p><p>Bill George now serves  as a Director of Goldman Sachs, Novartis, ExxonMobil and the Carnegie  Endowment for International Peace. In 2002, George was selected as one  of “The 25 Most Influential Business People of the Last 25 Years”.</p>"

      "<p><em>Originally posted in <a href=\"http://www.strategy-business.com/article/07409?pg=all\">Strategy+Business</a> on November 28, 2007.</em></p><em>Originally posted in <a href=\"http://www.strategy-business.com/article/07409?pg=all\">Strategy+Business</a> on November 28, 2007.</em><a href=\"http://www.strategy-business.com/article/07409?pg=all\">Strategy+Business</a><p>Back in 2003 — in the wake of the Enron, WorldCom,  Arthur Andersen, and Tyco scandals, when the corporate world was swept  up in protracted anxiety about its ethics and potential punishment for  transgressions — Bill George put forth a message of optimism. In his  bestseller <em>Authentic Leadership: Rediscovering the Secrets to Creating Lasting Value</em> (Jossey-Bass, 2003), the former CEO and chairman of Medtronic Inc., the  Minneapolis medical technol­ogy giant, laid out five essential  characteristics of effective leaders: They pursue purpose with passion;  they practice solid values; they lead with their hearts; they establish  enduring relationships; and, finally, they demonstrate self-discipline.  Possessed of those traits, he argued, individuals can foster healthy  organizations for the long haul.</p><em>Authentic Leadership: Rediscovering the Secrets to Creating Lasting Value</em><p>In his latest bestseller, <em>True North: Discover Your Authentic Leadership</em> (Jossey-Bass, 2007), George, who is currently professor of management  practice at Harvard Business School, expands upon this theme by drawing  out examples of effective senior executives in contemporary  corporations. “An enormous vacuum in leadership exists today,” he writes  in the introduction. “Yet there is no shortage of people with the  capacity for leadership. The problem is that we have a wrongheaded  notion of what constitutes a leader.”</p><em>True North: Discover Your Authentic Leadership</em><p>This view emerged from interviews that George, with  coauthor Peter Sims and colleague Diana Mayer, conducted with 125  executives of corporations, nonprofit institutes, and foundations. The  in­terviewees form a diverse and exceptionally accomplished group that  includes Andrea Jung, chairman and CEO of Avon Products; Richard  Kovacevich, chairman of Wells Fargo &amp; Company; Kevin Sharer, CEO and  chairman of Amgen, the biotech leader; Donna Dubinsky, cofounder of  Palm Inc.; Jeffrey Immelt, chairman and CEO of General Electric; and  television talk show host and producer Oprah Winfrey. George concluded  that great leaders don’t gain their capabilities by accident, but by  coming to terms with the often painful facts of their own lives. They  are “defined by their unique life stories and the way they frame their  stories to discover their passions and the purpose of their leadership,”  the authors write.</p><p>Each of the leaders in this book came to embrace a  set of values that served as a kind of lifelong personal compass. This,  in turn, helped keep them from being blown off course by the  extraordinary pressures that come to bear on the person in charge of any  organization. In the corporate sphere those pressures come from  investors, board members, and other stakeholders, whose priorities often  contradict one an­other or undermine the long-term good of the  enterprise. Many of the leaders interviewed had at one point found  themselves in situations that left them feeling dissatisfied and  frustrated. It was this discomfort that led them to take the time to  look inward to figure out what mattered most to them.</p><p>Knowing what matters — your “true north” — doesn’t  guarantee that you’ll stay on course, says George. “I don’t want to  suggest that all authentic leaders have achieved some level of  perfection that’s beyond the reach of most human beings,” he told <em>strategy+business</em> in a conversation last May at his lakeside home office in Minneapolis.  “On the contrary, everyone is capable of deviating from what they  believe. You get pulled off course and you need a compass to help guide  you back.”</p><em>strategy+business</em><p><strong>S+B: You’re adamant that there’s no single definition of the archetypal “great leader.”<br>GEORGE:</strong> That’s actually very good news. Think about it: If there were a  definitive role model for a leader, we’d all be trying to emulate it.  You and I are totally different people. We can’t emulate something we’re  not. In fact, if we do, we’re being inauthentic. If you try to emulate a  great leader like Jack Welch, you’ll be phony, because you’re not Jack  Welch. You’ve got to be who you are.</p><strong>S+B: You’re adamant that there’s no single definition of the archetypal “great leader.”<br>GEORGE:</strong><br><p>But that left our team with a problem in putting the  book together. As we went through the 3,000 pages of interview  transcripts, I worried that we were going to find a lot of interesting  anecdotes and nothing more. But finally, the insight jumped out at us:  An individual’s leadership is defined by his or her life story. In the  125 interviews we conducted, each person kept going back to their life  stories as defining for them. From those life stories, you could see the  clear link to their passions.</p><p>Their leadership may have gone off in different  directions before their aspirations really crystallized for them. Ellen  Breyer, the head of the Hazelden Foundation, the leading organization  for research on and treatment of chemical dependency, is an example of  this. Ellen was a student radical in the 1960s. She marched against the  Vietnam War, did voter registration among the poor, and was a civil  rights worker. The Nixon administration put her on its enemies list when  she was 20 or 21 years old and pulled her student loans.</p><p>Unable to pay for graduate school, she got married,  got into business, and rose to director of corporate marketing at  Godiva. But that never impassioned her the way her activism had.</p><p>When her youngest son left for college and she  realized that she was the same age that her father had been when he died  of alcoholism, she became traumatized. So she took a sabbatical, and  during this period, she realized that she was much more passionate about  her non­profit activities — including her work on the board of Hazelden  — than her for-profit career. So she quit her job and became interim  CEO of Hazelden (the previous chief ex­ecutive had been termi­nated).  She performed so well that eventually she convinced the board to make  her permanent. She was able to connect back to those early activities  and bring huge passion to her work. You can see that her life story was  formative.</p><p><strong>S+B: Everyone has a life story, but that  doesn’t make everyone a leader. Help us understand how people can use  their personal narratives to shape their leadership. <br>GEORGE:</strong> John Barth wrote, “The story of your life is not your life. It is your  story.” It means that the important thing is not the actual facts of  your life. How does Oprah Winfrey define her story? Her demons had  haunted her for years. Until she was 36, she defined herself as a bad  girl. She had been raped as a young girl and then as a teenager had  become sexually promiscuous and had gotten pregnant. She be­lieved she  was responsible for all that trouble.</p><strong>S+B: Everyone has a life story, but that  doesn’t make everyone a leader. Help us understand how people can use  their personal narratives to shape their leadership. <br>GEORGE:</strong><br><p>Her personal narrative and her career totally  changed the day that she interviewed Truddi Chase, a writer with  multiple personality disorder, who had been sexually abused as a child.  Oprah says she was overcome with emotion as Chase’s story triggered a  cascade of memories. “That was the first day I recognized that I was not  to blame,” she said. That moment was her crucible. She had an epiphany,  and reframed her narrative to say, “Maybe I wasn’t a bad girl.” From  there she found her mission, to deliver the message that “You’re  responsible for your life. You don’t have to let people take advantage  of you, physically or otherwise. You can see yourself as a victim, like I  did, or you can overcome that and use your experience to help others.”</p><p>My wife, Penny George, was in her 50s when it  happened to her. Her mother had taught her that “girls are not leaders.  In fact, if you were a leader, you might embarrass the family.” So in  rebellion, Penny became a great independent pro­fessional, a consulting  psychologist, and an executive evaluation team builder. After she got  her doctorate in her early 50s, she was setting up her own practice, and  was very excited about her work. One day, she picked up a message on  her answering machine: “Mrs. George, you have breast cancer. Please call  a surgeon.”</p><p>Can you imagine the coldness of this voice mail from  some stranger? “Have a nice day. You have breast cancer.” It was  extremely traumatic for her to face this. That trauma was her crucible  and led to her epiphany. She said, “Of course, they removed my breast,  but I hope I’m more than just a one-breasted woman. I need to be whole  in mind, body, heart, and spirit, not just physically whole.” Today  she’s a true leader in the field of integrative medicine, combining the  best of Western medicine with complementary therapies. She formed the  Bravewell Collaborative, a group of 25 foundations that pool their funds  to support the integrative transformation of medicine.</p><p><strong>S+B: What do you say to someone who sees his  life as his CV, as many future leaders do, and who has never really  thought in terms of his crucible? How do you force the epiphany that  helps you to write the narrative of your life?<br>GEORGE:</strong> You can’t force it, and you can’t prevent it.</p><strong>S+B: What do you say to someone who sees his  life as his CV, as many future leaders do, and who has never really  thought in terms of his crucible? How do you force the epiphany that  helps you to write the narrative of your life?<br>GEORGE:</strong><br><p>I was once my resume: Bill George, 23 years old and  on my way, destined to be a CEO. My father had told me when I was 7,  “Son, I failed. Don’t be like me. You can be CEO of a major company,”  and even made specific suggestions: Coca-Cola, P&amp;G, IBM.</p><p>That’s a pretty heavy trip for a little kid and one  you don’t escape as you get older, because it gets implanted in your  brain. From the time I graduated from Harvard Business School, I was  convinced that I was on a straight line to the top and that nothing  would get me offtrack. I was on the way, working for Honeywell here in  Minneapolis, and believed I would eventually run that company.</p><p>But one day, driving home around the lake over  there, I looked at myself in the rearview mirror and realized I was  miserable. I wasn’t passionate about the business. The company was  changing me. I was becoming more political. It was affecting how I  dressed, how I acted around board members — a lot of stuff I am very  uncomfortable with. I came home and talked to my wife, and she said,  “I’ve been trying to tell you that for a year.” It was very painful for  me to face that.</p><p>As I thought about it, I realized there was another  option. Medtronic, which is a local company, had asked me three times to  be its president and chief operating officer, and I had turned them  down because it was too small. Having had my epiphany, I called  Medtronic back, and asked if the job was still open. I’ll never forget  the day I walked through Medtronic’s door. It was like I was coming  home.</p><p>You can have these epiphanies in many ways.  Sometimes it’s as simple as getting 360-degree feedback. Your  subordinates tell you you’re not as great as you think you are. Doug  Baker, who’s now CEO of Ecolab, the cleaning supply company in St. Paul,  says that when he got really negative feedback, “It was horrifying to  see myself that way.” He was humbled.</p><p>Humbling is a big part of the epiphany. It starts  when you wonder, “If I am my resume, why aren’t others im­pressed with  me?” The epiphany takes place when people distinguish between their real  selves and their idealized selves.</p><p><strong>The 21st-Century Leader</strong></p><strong>The 21st-Century Leader</strong><p><strong>S+B: You write about balancing the “I” with the “we.” Why is that important?<br>GEORGE:</strong> External measures — getting into Princeton or landing a plum job — are  not indices of leadership. Rather, they reflect others’ view of you as a  great individual contributor. Yet in those roles that confer great  status, it’s easy to think, “I’ve proved I can make it. I can be a  star.” As Joseph Conrad might put it, “I’m the hero of my own journey.  I’m questing on.” In my case, it took the form of, “I’m Bill George, age  23, and I just have to decide which company’s good enough to have me as  CEO.”</p><strong>S+B: You write about balancing the “I” with the “we.” Why is that important?<br>GEORGE:</strong><br><p>The 21st-century definition of leadership has to be  different from what we understood it to be in the 20th century. In the  20th century, we were influenced by two world wars and the Depression.  “Follow the great man over the hill.” We should all be like Alfred Sloan  running General Motors.</p><p>That attitude led us into a couple of dangerous  areas. We di­chotomized workers and managers. The managers were the  leader class and the workers were a cost of doing business. We then got  caught up at the end of the century in the idea of a charismatic,  all-powerful leader who could leap tall buildings in a single bound and  transform the company overnight. In today’s context, this is nonsense.</p><p>Even at Medtronic, I had to make this transformation  myself. Just because the leader gets most of the publicity for  Medtronic’s achievements doesn’t mean that he is the one creating the  great innovation, the great product, the breakthroughs. Great  organizations are made up of people empowered at all levels. It is  leadership that makes the greatness sustainable. It’s the Howard Schultz  formula at Starbucks. It’s the Target formula.</p><p>The leader’s job today, in 21st-century terms, is  not about gaining followership. Followership is an outmoded notion.  Leadership starts with gaining alignment with the mission and values of  the organization: What are we about? What do we believe as a group?  Goldman Sachs, where I serve on the board, has achieved solid alignment  around its mission: “The clients’ interests always come first.” At  Medtronic, we aligned around the idea of “allevi­ating pain, restoring  health, and ex­tending life.” It was clear that anyone who didn’t buy  into that could work somewhere else.</p><p>Once we’ve achieved that alignment, we can be  empowered to lead in our own way to fulfill the mission of the company.  If you are a factory line worker in our Irvine, Calif., plant, that may  mean that you set such a high-quality standard making heart valves that  all your co-workers on the line emulate what you do. You may have no  direct reports, but you’re a leader all the same.</p><p>An attitude that leaders serve customers first is  especially vital to sustaining success. Employees are only empowered by  serving customers. They’re not motivated by getting the stock price up,  cutting the budget, or increasing the earnings. They don’t see tangible  rewards from succeeding by those metrics, even if you make them  shareholders. They get turned on about customers. In a Starbucks store,  the barista gets excited about creating an environment that’s fun for  the customer. I was at Starbucks earlier this morning and saw a barista  greet a customer by saying, “Oh, Rick, nice to see you. Do you want the  Rick special?” Rick comes there every morning because he has a  relationship with that Starbucks employee.</p><p><strong>S+B: So many values you describe seem to be  timeless and not limited to business. Are values and business really so  closely woven together? <br>GEORGE:</strong> They are, but we must  recognize a few new realities. First, employees and organizations have  changed. We don’t have an apprentice–craftsman model. Instead, we have  knowledge workers who know more than their bosses.</p><strong>S+B: So many values you describe seem to be  timeless and not limited to business. Are values and business really so  closely woven together? <br>GEORGE:</strong><br><p>Second, people have more options. When I was growing  up, if you could just get a job with General Motors, you had it made  for the rest of your life. Today, young people will work for seven or  eight different companies during their lifetime. Instead of being viewed  as hopping from job to job, they’re viewed as gaining great experience.  Meanwhile, they want to step up and lead right now. They don’t want to  wait 10 to 20 years to be a director or a vice president. That’s why so  many people have formed their own companies.</p><p>My third observation is the one most overlooked by  economists: People are looking for meaning and significance in their  work. You can offer that to a barista at Starbucks. You can offer that  to a Target employee — I was on the board at Target for 12 years — who  can delight a customer with fashion-forward merchandise or help create a  clean store without boxes on the floor. Med­tronic can offer it to  employees who feel they play a role in saving lives. It can be offered  in any context.</p><p>Humanity is timeless. In the 1980s and ’90s, we got  so caught up with the short-term pot of gold that we lost sight of what  we’re about. But great organizations, the ones that create lasting value  for shareholders, tend to follow the kind of approach I’m describing  over the long term.</p><p><strong>Withstanding Outside Pressure</strong></p><strong>Withstanding Outside Pressure</strong><p><strong>S+B: What do you tell CEOs of public  companies in today’s hyper-demanding environment? How do you advise them  to abide by their “true north” and not lose their heads?<br>GEORGE:</strong> Your “true north” cannot be redirected by external pressures. Once you  start trying to satisfy one shareholder, you’ll have to deal with  another shareholder with a different point of view. Same with board  members and all your other constituencies. If you allow yourself to be  pulled off course, you’re going to destroy your enterprise.</p><strong>S+B: What do you tell CEOs of public  companies in today’s hyper-demanding environment? How do you advise them  to abide by their “true north” and not lose their heads?<br>GEORGE:</strong><br><p>You have to stay a step ahead. You have to say,  “This is what we stand for. This is a long-term growth company. It will  give you great long-term returns, because we perform very well. Are you  interested? If you’re not, you may want to put your investment somewhere  else.” I’m not saying that you have to dismiss your shareholders or  your board. But you must remember who you are and what your com­pany is.</p><p>And you have to remember the central importance of  serving the customer. The companies that don’t do that, lose it. Now,  some good companies do hit the wall. Dell Inc. recently lost its grip on  customer service. But it’ll come back because it’s reacquainting itself  with what makes it, at its core, a fine company.</p><p><strong>S+B: Who does this well? What public company leaders are, in your view, sticking to their “true north”?<br>GEORGE:</strong> I’m going to mention a leader who oversees one of the largest  organizations in the world, with 5.5 million people associated with it.  I’m talking about Andrea Jung, CEO of Avon Products, the cosmetics  company, although she doesn’t call it that. She calls it “the company  for women.”</p><strong>S+B: Who does this well? What public company leaders are, in your view, sticking to their “true north”?<br>GEORGE:</strong><br><p>Andrea got to her current position by a circuitous  route. She had been a superstar at Bloomingdale’s and then at Neiman  Marcus, where she was an executive vice president at 31. At 35, when she  was clearly on her way to becoming CEO, she stepped down from  retailing, without a new job. When she came to my Harvard Business  School class, I asked her why she quit. She said, “I didn’t want to  spend the rest of my life making luxury goods for the upper class.”</p><p>Nine months later, she landed an executive position  at Avon and did great work for five years. But then she got passed over  for the CEO job. At that point, a board member, Ann Moore of Time Inc.,  gave her very penetrating advice: “Andrea, follow your compass and not  your clock.” In other words, “It’s not important that you’re CEO by 40.  Life is long. You need to make sure this is the company you want to be  at. You can be CEO somewhere else just like that. Call up Bloomingdale’s  and tell them you’ll come back. Is that what you want?” And she said,  “No, I’ll follow my compass. I’ll stay on course with what I believe.”</p><p>Twenty months later, in 2000, she was appointed CEO.  She im­plemented her vision of Avon as a company that empowers women —  both employees and customers — and had a great five years.</p><p>Then, in the fall of 2005, the company faltered.  Revenues grew just 5 percent that year, and earnings were flat. Andrea  had to look inside herself to figure out how to make her passion for  empowering women become a more profitable business for Avon. She changed  the whole structure, took out US$300 million in costs — much of it by  flattening the organization and reducing management by 25 percent. She  then told the stock market that she was investing in growth and putting  none of those savings toward the bottom line in the near term and that  she was going to suspend earnings guidance. The stock plummeted 30  percent, and the shareholders were not happy. But her board bought into  her vision and supported her as she stayed true to what she believed.</p><p>Andrea has put another million representatives out  there, including 300,000 in China. She has boosted advertising,  realigned manufacturing, and outsourced a number of functions. Avon’s  results indicate her strategy is working; the stock has increased 40  percent from its 2005 low point.</p><p><strong>S+B: What happens when a leader gets derailed? How do you get back?<br>GEORGE:</strong> You come back the way Kevin Sharer did. Sharer had run GE’s satellite  business and then went to MCI as marketing chief, thinking he had a  straight shot to the CEO’s desk. Six weeks into his tenure, he marched  into the chairman’s office with a plan for reorganizing the global  marketing group. That arrogance earned him nothing but scorn from his  colleagues, who had put years into building the company.</p><strong>S+B: What happens when a leader gets derailed? How do you get back?<br>GEORGE:</strong><br><p>Kevin spent two miserable years at MCI that nearly  brought him to his knees. During that period he had to face his own  demons, his own arrogance, and say, “You know, being a leader is not  being a star.” When he got the opportunity to move over to Amgen, the  biotech company, he got a biologist to teach him the science and became a  true student of the business. He did not go in and pronounce what the  company should do. He took seven years understudying the CEO, working in  the labs, visiting competitors’ labs, riding around with salespeople.</p><p>When he became CEO, his first move was to meet with  the top 150 people at Amgen and ask, “What do you think we should do?”  That probing gave him a mandate, he says. He had a great run for seven  years, but he’s now facing more difficult times with a challenge to one  of Amgen’s drugs. That’s the ebb and flow of business. Kevin is a solid  leader, and he will step up to these challenges as Andrea Jung did.</p><p><strong>S+B: You’re saying that the difference  between his MCI and Amgen experiences was the humility to recognize the  business’s context.<br>GEORGE:</strong> Not just the business, but also  the personal context, in­cluding other people in the com­pany, and the  broader societal context. Sam Palmisano, the CEO of IBM, says that in  the 1990s we saw leaders who set themselves off from others, who were  autonomous, and who tried to achieve greatness by doing everything  themselves. Today, we need a much more collaborative model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><strong>S+B: You’re saying that the difference  between his MCI and Amgen experiences was the humility to recognize the  business’s context.<br>GEORGE:</strong><br><p>Sam’s a great example of the importance of context.  For IBM to succeed, it has to collaborate with governments,  nongovernmental or­ganizations, and other companies. He’s transformed  IBM from a task-oriented organization managed by goals into one led by  values, which the employees themselves helped identify. They came out of  a “values jam” that IBM held with its em­ployees over the company  Intranet in 2003. For three days, tens of thousands of people worked  together to hone the values down to three: dedication to every client’s  success; innovation that matters, for the company and for the world;  trust and personal responsibility in all relationships.</p><p>IBM hasn’t given up the goals, but the values are  premier. Sam has gone around the world teaching them. Whether you work  for IBM in Greece, South Africa, Indonesia, or Alabama, you know the  values well enough to carry them out in your own context.</p><p><strong>S+B: What worries you about the next generation of leaders?<br>GEORGE:</strong> A lot of young people are going up the staff route and not getting the  experience of leadership early on. Many of the best leaders in my  classroom are military leaders, because they’ve had real experience on  two or three tours of duty in Iraq. They can recognize the times when  you have to violate the rules to adapt to the circumstance.</p><strong>S+B: What worries you about the next generation of leaders?<br>GEORGE:</strong><br><p>Emotional intelligence also matters. As Dick  Kovacevich of Wells Fargo says, “Above the 99th percentile of  intelligence, there is an inverse correlation between leadership and  intelligence.” In other words, many exceptionally intelligent leaders  try to be the smartest person in the room and impose their views. They  don’t get the best out of their people. Leadership is about much more  than IQ, and requires you to develop yourself through the mosaic of all  your experiences.</p>"

Recently we’ve seen this in media coverage of  lenders, which ABC News called “the home wreckers.”</p><p>“Locking families out of the American dream by offering mortgages too  good to be true,” was anchor Charles Gibson’s description.</p><p>Sure, there are unscrupulous lenders out there. But to describe an  entire class of businesspeople in such a way is unforgivable.</p><p>If it were not for hard-working businessmen and women, we would not have  grocery stores stocked with food, cars, our computers, houses or any of  our comforts of life.</p><p>There’s an old African proverb that says it takes a village to raise a  child. Well, it takes a whole country full of businessmen to sustain  America. They keep America – and others around the world – eating,  driving, playing, and building homes.</p><p>But many Americans don’t view businessmen that way. A 2007 Harris Poll  revealed that in a list of occupations rated for “very great prestige,”  businessmen came in 15th place, after farmers and lawyers. Those  specifically in the financial sector ranked even lower – stock brokers,  accountants and bankers came in 19th, 20th and 21st, respectively.</p><p>The unfortunate truth is that the crimes and scandals of a few – like  Enron and WorldCom – have tainted the nation’s view of all in the same  profession.</p><p>The news media have been the constant bearers of bad news and negative  portrayals of businessmen. Yes, Enrons do happen, but very few  executives are involved in such scandals. Watching CNN, however, you  might think crime was practically a job requirement. On CNN’s “Lou Dobbs  Tonight” in 2006, 76 percent of the show’s portrayals of businessmen  were negative. The program had criminal businessmen seven times as often  as it featured businessmen-philanthropists.</p><p>That interesting nugget comes from a study by the Media Research  Center’s Business &amp; Media Institute, which looked at an entire year  of evening newscasts. It found when businessmen were included in the  news, they were often under attack.</p><p>This in-depth study, which took thousands of man-hours, identified  journalists’ portrayals of businessmen and women and evaluated those  that had a tilt toward the positive or the negative. Of those, it found  57 percent were negative. Businessmen were described as “fat cats” or  “another corporate crook,” and stories were laced with worries about  “stratospheric sums” of “CEO pay run amok.”</p><p>From company profits to consumer prices, money was the name of the game.  CBS even did a story that scolded a multibillionaire for spending his  money! Maybe those reporters didn’t learn in Economics 101 that spending  money creates jobs for countless people. Instead, CBS got huffy about  one businessman’s buying habits.</p><p>Everybody’s always making too much money to suit journalists … never  mind that some of those network anchors are pulling in tens of millions  themselves. According to TV Guide, CBS’s Katie Couric makes $15 million a  year, while NBC’s Brian Williams makes $8 million.</p><p>No, the nightly newsers didn’t focus on the positive. Despite more than  $51 billion pledged from the most generous Americans in 2006, according  to The Chronicle of Philanthropy, journalists portrayed businessmen as  criminals one-and-a-half times more often than they were portrayed as  philanthropists.</p><p>I know businessmen who give generously, and they wouldn’t want to be  featured on the evening news. They prefer to give without widespread  fame. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t good stories about businessmen  out there – stories that enterprising reporters could dig up – about  those who build companies and communities.</p><p>Other nations would love to have a chance at this system of free  enterprise that our media take for granted and even attack. Bill George,  a Harvard Business School professor and businessman himself, wrote  about that system on BusinessWeek.com August 5.</p><p>“Every government leader and business executive I have met in developing  countries –from the mayor of Beijing to the ruler of the United Arab  Emirates – is eager for one thing: U.S.-style capitalism to build their  economies, create jobs and wealth for their people, and bring their  countries fully into the global trading network,” George wrote. “From  Kazakhstan to Vietnam, people are hungry for capitalism.”</p><p>People from around the world come here to work. That coveted capitalism  that creates jobs and wealth is maintained by hard-working businessmen  and women – most of whom stay out of the spotlight. They’re not  scandal-ridden. They’re inventors, innovators and entrepreneurs. They  provide jobs to more than 100 million Americans. And they give back to  their communities.</p><p>Unfortunately, they’re just not making headlines.</p>"

And Citigroup  operates in more than 100 countries, employs roughly 370,000 workers and  offers services ranging from credit cards (120 million accounts in the  United States alone) to banking, mortgages and asset management.</p><p>“The concept of Citigroup and Time Warner as unified companies is  questionable,” says William W.

In the 1960s and 1970s,  conglomerates like ITT and Gulf + Western were all the rage. But in the  1980s, investors began to complain about poor performance and an obvious  lack of synergy (Gulf + Western owned everything from sugar plantations  to movie studios), and the conglomerates were broken up.</p><p>By the late 1990s and the early part of this decade, it seemed like  the conglomerate was making a reappearance. Now in the wake of the  departure of Mr. Parsons, Mr. Prince and Mr. O’Neal, the question of  whether size matters in corporate America is up for debate again. “We’re  at an inflection point,” says Mr. Sonnenfeld. “If the economy weakens,  it might be more likely these giants will be broken up.”</p><p>It is unclear whether the model of a supersize company will be  shelved, but executives will certainly want to re-examine one of primary  rationales behind it — diversification. The theory, at least, was that  losses in one area would be offset by gains in another. That safety net  clearly didn’t work for Citigroup.</p><p>Whatever happens, it’s clear that investors are losing their patience  with chief executives who can’t deliver. A study of 2,500 top global  companies by Booz Allen Hamilton, the consulting firm, found that annual  turnover among chief executives increased by 59 percent between 1995  and 2006. Over the same period, according to the survey, involuntary  exits from the corner office soared. One in eight departures was  involuntary in 1995; by 2006, the ratio was  nearly one in three.</p><p>One explanation for that trend, says Steven Wheeler, a senior vice  president at Booz Allen, is not necessarily size but complexity. “The  ability to run and make changes in one division doesn’t translate into  the ability to do that in another and as C.E.O. you’re responsible for  the whole business,” he says.</p><p>Other experts insist the problem isn’t size or complexity, but the  skill of the individual chief executive and his or her top team. And  that’s what was lacking at Merrill and Citigroup, according to Noel M.  Tichy, a leading management authority at the <a title=\"More articles about the University of Michigan.\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_michigan/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">University of Michigan</a> and co-author of the new book “Judgment: How Winning Leaders Make Great Calls.”</p><a title=\"More articles about the University of Michigan.\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/u/university_of_michigan/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">University of Michigan</a><p>Big companies, he says, are especially vulnerable if they don’t take  the time to train and develop future chief executives. “What you’re  seeing is broken leadership pipelines,” he says. “Merrill and Citi never  invested in their pipelines.”</p><p>As for complexity, Mr. Tichy argues that <a title=\"More information about General Electric Company\" href=\"http://topics.nytimes.com/top/news/business/companies/general_electric_company/index.html?inline=nyt-org\">General Electric</a> has prospered despite having a stable of businesses as varied as jet  engines, commercial finance and light bulbs.

I had my bags packed and ticket in  hand, but was torn between heading off to one of the most prestigious  real estate conferences in the country or staying behind and being with  my fellow San Diegans during a “family” crisis. Realistically, there was  nothing for me to do in San Diego, but I felt pulled to stay. When  friends who needed to evacuate called looking for shelter, I knew what I  could do to play my role. So I turned over my house as my contribution  and headed off to visit with 7500 of my closest ULI associates.</p><p>The conference was fabulous. Kofi Annan, the former United Nations  secretary-general and Nobel Peace Prize recipient, delivered the keynote  address. Other speakers included economist Michael Boskin; former  Medtronics CEO Bill George, now a professor of management practice at  the Harvard Business School; and Queen Noor of Jordan.</p><p>But when I was back in my hotel room I turned on CNN to watch in horror,  the city I love and that sometimes drives me crazy with its small-town  mentality, engulfed at the edges in flames.</p><p>Interestingly enough, when I arrived back home Friday, I watched the  news that portrayed a San Diego that took my breath away. What I saw was  government, fire fighters and citizens operating in unity. Our  government officials, local newscasters and fire chiefs were doing an  outstanding job of effectively and accurately communicating the plan and  the progress. The citizens evacuated peacefully and willingly amidst  fear and the unknown. Support flowed in from businesses, nonprofit  organizations and San Diegans in general. But on Saturday as I was  cleaning up after my guests departed I burst into deep sobs feeling the  grief of what was lost. I thought how could I experience elation and  grief simultaneously and it reminded me that life is like that.</p><p>The crisis has spawned all kinds of discussion about how to better plan  our communities at the edge: wild land-urban interface zones, shelter in  place and better science-based evidence to understand why houses ignite  and burn down. ULI plans to be a part of our regional discussion as we  move forward in a thoughtful way of implementing a strategy for  developing and rebuilding at the edges.</p><p>Since the 2003 Cedar Fire, we are seeing better local cooperation,  unanimity and coordination which are a great start to a more holistic  consensus on land use and infrastructure issues, and the beginning of  more regional solutions. The world is also in a very different place  since then. Today, the reality of climate change has tipped over into  every aspect of our thinking, planning and living. This alone requires  that our leadership stay ahead of the learning curve so they are in a  position to make decisions in our best interest.</p><p>Last year, the ULI San Diego/Tijuana Real Estate Trends conference  focused on the great infrastructure deficit facing not only San Diego,  but also the entire country. A few months later, a national dialog  ensued spurred after the bridge collapse in Minneapolis this past  summer. This year, our Trends program will focus on sustainability where  leaders can learn what is emerging in this new world we find ourselves  in. The day will include a special keynote address by Hunter Lovins,  founder of Natural Capitalism Solutions named a Hero for the Planet by <em>Time</em> magazine. Lovins works with corporations and governments worldwide to  develop and implement sustainable energy and resource systems. Panels  include sustainability trends for all product types and how climate  change will impact CEQA. Each attendee will receive a copy of Emerging  Trends in Real Estate (a trends and forecast publication with a 29-year  history, and is the most highly regarded and widely read forecast report  in the real estate industry. Emerging Trends in Real Estate (2008,  undertaken jointly by ULI and PricewaterhouseCoopers, provides an  outlook on U.S. investment and development trends, real estate finance  and capital markets, property sectors, metropolitan areas and other real  estate issues.</p><em>Time</em><p>If you are a leader, you will put yourself at the forefront of thinking  and implementation of best practices by attending the ULI San  Diego/Tijuana Real Estate Trends Conference being held 7:30 a.m.-1:30  p.m. Nov. 13 at the Hilton Torrey Pines.

      "<p><em>Originally posted in <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/educate/college/business/biz-text.htm\">USA Today</a> on September 4, 2007.</em></p><em>Originally posted in <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/educate/college/business/biz-text.htm\">USA Today</a> on September 4, 2007.</em><a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/educate/college/business/biz-text.htm\">USA Today</a><p>Scientists have found that first-born children are  smarter than their brothers and sisters. It appears they are more likely  to succeed in business, too.</p><p>Be it drive or aptitude or a slightly higher  IQ, the advantage crosses gender and international lines. Microsoft CEO  Steve Balmer is an eldest child, as is Avon’s Andrea Jung. Charles  Schwab, the oldest of two, overcame dyslexia to become one of the  world’s richest. Joe Moglia, CEO of TD Ameritrade, was first-born of  five and says he received regular corporal punishment as a child.</p><p>When he was 8, Bill George says his father  tried to make up for his own perceived failures by telling his eldest  son he could become CEO of Coca-Cola, Procter &amp; Gamble or IBM. “A  heavy load for a young boy,” says George, who worked summers at all  three and later rose to be CEO of Medtronic, from where he retired.</p><p>A large study done by Norwegian scientists and  published in July in the journal Science found that oldest children on  average had a slightly higher IQ than their siblings.</p><p>The study did not look at eventual business  achievement, but the gap of just 2.3 points was enough to sometimes mean  the difference in better colleges and job opportunities, and the study  suggested that first-born children were more likely to strive.</p><p>No scientific study of such size has examined  the birth order of CEOs, but USA TODAY asked Vistage, the world’s  largest CEO organization, to survey its membership. It conducts surveys  regularly on a variety of business and economic issues, but the birth  order question struck an unprecedented nerve.</p><p>Vistage received 1,582 responses, vs. 200 to  300 for previous surveys, says spokesman Tony Vignieri. Of those, 43%  were born first, 23% born last and 33% landed somewhere in the middle.</p><p>USA TODAY followed up with a smaller survey of  CEOs on its own panel. It received responses from 155, of which 59% were  first born, 18% were the youngest and 23% fell in the middle.</p><p>Why do first-born children so dominate the  boardrooms? CEOs themselves say they got hit in the face early in life  with a stew of factors. Those included the undivided attention, at least  for a time, from their parents.</p><p>They say they felt the pressure of greater  expectations. They were forced to become self-sufficient because they  had to look after younger siblings while not having an older sibling  looking out for them.</p><p>Ben Dattner, a psychology professor at New York  University who has studied birth order, says it makes sense that  first-born children rise to the top.</p><p>They are often more extroverted, confident,  assertive, authoritarian, dominant, inflexible, conformist, politically  conservative, task-oriented, conscientious, disciplined, defensive about  errors, and fearful of losing position and rank.</p><p>The days may have passed when the family farm  was handed down to the oldest son, but the advantage persists in  parental time and resources, Dattner says. He knows of one Harvard  classroom where first-born freshmen are asked to stand on the first day  of school. Only about 20% remain seated, he says.</p><p>Craig Hunt, CEO of vacation home developer Keys  Caribbean Resorts and a middle child, says his older brother  automatically inherited the helm of his father’s plastic business. “It  didn’t matter which child was the smarter. It only took me 30 years to  earn my CEO job elsewhere,” he says.</p><p>The oldest children are like surrogate parents,  says Jim McCann, CEO of 1-800-Flowers and the oldest of five. That  means they learn parental skills in childhood, such as offering  encouragement and setting limits for what will be tolerated, skills that  remain valuable to CEOs, he says.</p><p>The impact can also be small and incremental.  Michael Koss, CEO of stereo headphones maker Koss, remembers going to  the candy store with his four younger siblings in tow and having 25  cents for each. He put each sibling’s change into a separate pocket, his  first lesson in accounting.</p><p>The darker side, jokes Mike Bolen, CEO of  McCarthy Building and the oldest of two boys, is that first-borns get  “early training in taking full credit for anything good that happens,  and blaming baby brother for anything that goes wrong. That serves  first-born children well as they maneuver up the corporate ladder.”</p><p>Eldest children become leaders, though not  necessarily “quality” leaders, says first-born Adam Sewall, CEO of  telecommunications company T3 Communications. True, they are pioneers,  he says, but “a lot of pioneers end up with arrows in their backs.”</p><p>Many first-born CEOs said they have more  intelligent brothers and sisters. And younger siblings say their smarter  brothers and sisters don’t always have the business drive.</p><p>David Cline, CEO of Balboa Instruments, has an  older brother “many more times intelligent than me,” who retired at  about 55 as a computer consultant, was never an executive, and now plays  volleyball on the beach.</p><p>They’re not sure they’re any happier than their  less accomplished siblings, but first-born CEOs — being both confident  and fearful of losing rank — say they’re certain that they make better  leaders, if only because leadership is flat-out expected of older  children.</p><p>Not a slam dunk</p><p>Of course, many successful CEOs were not the  first born. Southwest Airlines CEO Gary Kelly was, but former Southwest  CEO Howard Putnam was the baby on an Iowa farm. “My two talented and  intelligent older sisters supported me in every endeavor,” he says.</p><p>And Dattner says that there’s growing evidence  that first-born CEOs aren’t always the best choice. They can solve  problems and can usually drive through incremental improvements, but  later-born CEOs are more likely to take risks and challenge the status  quo. They’re born into families where someone is already occupying the  niche of academic achiever, so they seek out other creative ways to  blaze their own path.</p><p>CEOs who were the babies in the family believe  that the next generation of CEOs will more often come from their ranks  because they grew up with more freedom and fewer boundaries. Luis  Rivera, a baby brother and CEO of e-mail software company J.L. Halsey,  says when he was a child at his first ski lesson, he decided to “launch  himself downhill.” His older brother said he was crazy. “Yet, in his  eyes, I could see he was impressed,” Rivera says. “The order of birth  has little to do with it. It’s mostly our risk tolerance.”</p><p>Patrick Sweeney, CEO of computer firm Odin  Technologies and a champion rower, says he never had his older brother’s  strength, which taught him to “compete against the likes of IBM or  (Hewlett-Packard).”</p><p>Similarly, Ben Golub, CEO of tech company  Plaxo, says being the youngest of two boys toughened him up, but said he  could not elaborate — too big a risk “my big brother would give me a  noogie.”</p><p>Harland Stonecipher, CEO of Pre-Paid Legal  Services is the youngest, with four brothers and a sister. His parents  were sharecroppers, and none of his siblings completed high school. They  were too poor to have running water “unless I ran and got it,” he says.  But he was the youngest by nine years, which meant family finances had  improved slightly as older siblings moved away, enough so that there was  a window of opportunity for Stonecipher where none existed before.</p><p>Middle children have war stories, too. “My dad  was an expert practitioner of conditional love, so there was a  significant amount of competition between girls,” says Karen Scott,  president of Chelsea &amp; Scott, a seller of educational toys, and the  second of three daughters.</p><p>Then there are those such as FedEx CEO Fred  Smith, who calls himself a “hybrid mongrel” because his mother was a  widow who had two previous sons before she married his father. Smith is  an only child from the second marriage, but has two older half brothers.</p><p>Similar stories globally</p><p>The domination of older children in business  appears to have no gender or international boundaries. Andrea McGinty,  founder of dot-com success stories Baby Dagny and It’s Just Lunch, is  the eldest of six, as is Leonard Liu, CEO of Augmentum, a 1,000-employee  software developer based in Shanghai with offices in Beijing and San  Francisco.</p><p>McGinty says she was old enough to remember her  father working his way up in a department store chain and how his hard  work led to a transition for the family to a better lifestyle.</p><p>Unlike her siblings, she often accompanied her  father to work, where she stocked shelves at age 5 and was doing weather  analysis reports on store traffic at age 12.</p><p>McGinty says she learned that hard work has its  rewards and that her experience being a “bit bossy” with siblings is a  valuable asset to this day.</p><p>Vijay Eswaran was first-born in Malaysia to a  family of Indian origin. He is CEO of Hong Kong-based QI Group, a  2,000-employee conglomerate with 1 million customers in 190 countries.  Most people would say his kid brother, Vicknesh, also is a success. He  runs an 85-employee subsidiary phone company in London. But Vijay says  he and his brother are very different.</p><p>Vijay says he is more driven. “It’s not about  intelligence. It’s the drive,” says Vijay, also the oldest among 25  cousins. He says he still ruffles the hair of his cousins when he greets  them, even though most are by now parents themselves.</p><p>Says Vijay: “Worldwide, the eldest tend to be  people who break new ground, take on challenges. We have greater  responsibility because we were impromptu babysitters. We have to set an  example. Everyone is looking up to you.</p><p>“It puts weight on you a  little early,” he says. “You grow up a little faster, get a little  wiser, whereas the younger ones are more pampered. We take the first  bruises, the first falls.”</p>"

      "<p><strong>True North: Discover Your Authentic Leadership</strong><br>\n<strong>Address by Bill George</strong><br>\n<strong>Former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Medtronic, Inc.</strong><br>\n<strong>and Professor of Management Practice, Harvard Business School</strong><br>\n<strong>The Raytheon Lectureship in Business Ethics</strong><br>\n<strong>At Bentley College</strong></p><strong>True North: Discover Your Authentic Leadership</strong><br><strong>Address by Bill George</strong><br><strong>Former Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Medtronic, Inc.</strong><br><strong>and Professor of Management Practice, Harvard Business School</strong><br><strong>The Raytheon Lectureship in Business Ethics</strong><br><strong>At Bentley College</strong><p><em>Wednesday, March 28, 2007</em></p><em>Wednesday, March 28, 2007</em><p align=\"justify\">It is a particular privilege to be here at Bentley today to deliver the Raytheon Lecture in Business Ethics.&nbsp; One of my role models was Tom Phillips, then head of Raytheon, who was such an ethical and values-driven leader.&nbsp; A number of exceptional leaders have spoken in this series previously, including Anne Mulcahy of Xerox, who is one of the leaders we’ve written about in my new book, <em>True North: Discover Your Authentic Leadership</em>.</p><em>True North: Discover Your Authentic Leadership</em><p align=\"justify\">I’d like to talk today about your “True North” and how you discover your authentic leadership.&nbsp; In other words, how do you become a truly authentic leader, who can be true to what you believe in throughout your life and be highly successful in the business world, the non-profit world or whatever area of leadership you choose to go into.</p><p align=\"justify\">When I was elected CEO of Medtronic back in 1991, I told the board that I should serve no more than 10 years.&nbsp; I set that outside time limit on my tenure because I felt that CEO’s in those days were serving for too long.&nbsp; I was in my fifties when I concluded this time and thought, “What am I going to do now? I’m obviously not going to retire at this age.”&nbsp; So I moved to Switzerland with my wife, Penny, and spent a working sabbatical, teaching at IMD, the business school, and EPFL, the Swiss Federal Polytechnic Institute, to find out if I liked teaching.&nbsp; I found out that I loved it, especially working with young people on the cusp of their hopes and dreams.</p><p align=\"justify\">At that time I also started getting a lot of calls from the media wanting my thoughts on why Enron, WorldCom, Tyco and other companies were going bankrupt and their executives being led off in handcuffs.&nbsp; I asked why they were calling <em>me</em>, and they said, “Because none of the other CEO’s will talk to us.”&nbsp; That’s why I wrote my first book2<em>. </em></p><em>me</em><em>. </em><p align=\"justify\">Then, Kim Clark, the Dean of Harvard Business School, invited me to come and teach there.&nbsp; So, since 2004 I have been teaching leadership and leadership development at the Harvard Business School, and studying how to develop a new generation of authentic leaders to run our corporations, thus avoiding a repeat of the multiple ethical lapses and destructive actions that many leaders in my generation engaged in.</p><h2 align=\"justify\">The Leadership Crisis in America</h2><p align=\"justify\">America today faces a major crisis in leadership that spans the fields of politics, government, business, non-profits, education and religion.&nbsp; Confidence in our leaders, especially in business and politics, has fallen to an all-time low.&nbsp; Recent surveys by the Gallup poll show that only 22 percent of Americans trust our business leaders, and even fewer trust our political leaders.&nbsp; That’s not just a problem – it represents the potential for disaster.</p><p align=\"justify\">In part, the problem comes from a misguided notion of what constitutes a leader, driven by an obsession with leaders at the top.&nbsp; In far too many cases we have selected the wrong people to lead and given them far too much power, which they have frequently abused.&nbsp; As President Abraham Lincoln once said, “If you want to find out what a man is made of, give him unlimited power and watch how he uses it.”&nbsp; In many cases our leaders have abused their power to serve themselves, instead of serving the people to whom they are responsible.</p><p align=\"justify\">Our system of capitalism, in which I believe so fervently, is based on trust – trust in the corporations and institutions that serve us and in their leaders.&nbsp; Through our legal system, society has granted corporation s enormous freedom and power to make money for its owners while serving its constituencies and benefiting society as a whole.&nbsp; If we in the business community violate that trust, we risk losing those privileges and destroying the very system that has made the American economy the most vibrant and enduring in the history of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; Witness the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, hastily passed by the U. S. Congress in thirty-one days in response to the crisis of confidence created by the fall of Enron and other companies.&nbsp; Violating the public trust risks the loss of capitalism’s freedoms.</p><p align=\"justify\">For business leaders, trust is the vital fuel that makes our system function effectively.&nbsp; If our customers do not trust us, why would they buy our products?&nbsp; Physicians implanting life-saving Medtronic defibrillators in their patients have no idea of whether these products will work perfectly to save their patients’ lives, so they have to trust Medtronic to ensure their quality.&nbsp; Employees trust their corporate leaders to build successful businesses that will provide good jobs and sound benefits, like health care and retirement plans.&nbsp; Investors trust corporate leaders to provide fair returns on their investments.&nbsp; And the public trusts corporations to act in the public interest.&nbsp; When leaders violate that trust, they put our entire system of capitalism at risk, as well as the lives and livelihood of their customers, employees, and investors.</p><h2 align=\"justify\">Learning from Authentic Leaders</h2><p align=\"justify\">Our study included 125 leaders whom we interviewed.&nbsp; They provided us with some brilliant insights into what has enabled them to be successful and how they developed into authentic leaders.&nbsp; They were remarkably open and candid in sharing their life stories, personal struggles, failures, and triumphs.&nbsp; Our field study represents the largest in-depth research ever undertaken about how business leaders develop.</p><p align=\"justify\">These 125 leaders are a diverse group of women and men from a wide array of racial, religious, socioeconomic backgrounds and nationalities.&nbsp; They cover the full spectrum of leaders’ life spans, ranging in age from 23 to 93.&nbsp; Within the group, 28 percent are females, eight percent are racial minorities, and 12 percent are international citizens. Half of them are CEO’s, and the other half includes an array of non-profit leaders, mid-career leaders, and young leaders just starting on their journeys.</p><p align=\"justify\">In the past fifty years, leadership scholars have conducted more than one thousand studies attempting to determine the definitive leadership styles, characteristics, or personality traits of successful leaders.&nbsp; None of these studies has produced a definitive profile of the ideal leader.&nbsp; Thank goodness.&nbsp; If scholars had produced a cookie-cutter leadership style, people would be forever trying to emulate it.&nbsp; That alone would make them into personas.</p><p align=\"justify\">Kevin Sharer, who is currently chairman and CEO of Amgen, saw the downside of GE’s cult of personality in the 1980s, while working as Jack Welch’s assistant.&nbsp; As he said, “Everyone wanted to be like Jack, but leadership has many voices.&nbsp; You need to be who you are, not try to emulate somebody else.”</p><p align=\"justify\">The reality is that <em>no one can be authentic by trying to be like someone else.</em> There is no doubt that you can learn from the experiences of others, but there is no way you can be successful trying to <em>be</em> like them.&nbsp; People trust you when you are genuine and authentic, not an imitation.</p><em>no one can be authentic by trying to be like someone else.</em><em>be</em><p align=\"justify\">After interviewing these leaders, we believe we understand why previous studies have not been successful: <em>Leaders are highly complex human beings, who have distinctive qualities that cannot be sufficiently described by lists of traits or characteristics.</em></p><em>Leaders are highly complex human beings, who have distinctive qualities that cannot be sufficiently described by lists of traits or characteristics.</em><h2 align=\"justify\">Your Leadership Emerges from Your Life Story</h2><p align=\"justify\">In reading the 3,000 pages of transcripts from these interviews, we were startled to see that these leaders did not identify any characteristics, traits, skills or styles that led to their success.&nbsp; Rather, they believed their leadership emerged from their life stories.&nbsp; By constantly testing themselves through real-world experiences, and by reframing their life stories to understand who they are, they unleashed their passions and discovered the purpose of their leadership.</p><p align=\"justify\">I vividly recall my interview with Dick Kovacevich, CEO of Wells Fargo, who has established the most successful track record of any commercial banker for the past twenty years.&nbsp; When I asked Dick what made him so successful, he surprised me with his answer.&nbsp; Instead of lauding the bank’s success, he spent twenty minutes telling what it was like growing up in a small sawmill town in western Washington, where no one had ever gone to college.&nbsp; Dick said he learned to lead not at Stanford Business School, where he graduated at the top of his class, but on his hometown athletic fields and at the corner grocery store where he worked from age eleven to eighteen.&nbsp; Every day Dick played sports for three hours, raced home to grab a sandwich, and then worked three hours in the grocery store.&nbsp; Sports taught Kovacevich that “a group of people can perform so much better as a team than as the sum of their individual talents.”</p><p align=\"justify\">In Wells Fargo he has attempted to recreate the local bank from his hometown, making Wells Fargo the most client-friendly bank wherever it operates.&nbsp; At the corporate level he has surrounded himself with talented executives who build the bank’s individual businesses, while he acts as quarterback of the team, much like he did as an all-state football player.</p><p align=\"justify\">Kovacevich’s story is just one of hundreds we heard from our interviewees.&nbsp; The stories covered the full gamut of life’s experiences.&nbsp; One of the most powerful came from Starbucks’ founder Howard Schultz, whose father’s loss of his job and health care benefits from slipping on the ice led Schultz to create a company like Starbucks where his father would have been proud to work. For Schultz, Starbucks is about a creating a community of empowered employees and satisfied customers.</p><p align=\"justify\">Chinese-American Andrea Jung, now CEO of Avon Products, was a rising star at Neiman-Marcus, as executive VP in her early thirties.&nbsp; She decided she did not want to spend her life selling high-fashion designs to upper-class women, so she resigned without another job.&nbsp; Joining Avon Products and later becoming CEO, she changed the mission of the company from selling cosmetics to the empowerment of women.&nbsp; Under her leadership, Avon has gone from 1.5 million to 5.5 million people working for the company and achieving economic independence and success through their efforts.&nbsp; She and Schultz have remained true to their life stories to fulfill their personal missions and enhance the lives of tens of millions of people.</p><p align=\"justify\">Most of the leaders we interviewed have been profoundly shaped by crucibles in their lives.&nbsp; These traumatic experiences enabled them to realize that leadership was <em>not</em> about their success or gratification, but rather about serving other people and empowering them to lead.&nbsp; In my experience – perhaps oversimplified – you can separate all leaders into two categories: those for whom leadership is about their success and those who are leading to serve others.&nbsp; The latter group finds inspiration in their life stories and the crucibles of their lives to make the transformation from “I” to “We.”&nbsp; The former group never makes that transition.&nbsp; Although many of them disguise their intentions with “we” language, their actions under pressure often reveal they are out for themselves.</p><em>not</em><p align=\"justify\">One of the most moving crucible stories came from Novartis chairman and CEO Dan Vasella, whose early life traumas of spending a year in a sanatorium at age eight, and the subsequent deaths of his sister and his father, motivated him to become a compassionate physician who would lead a global healthcare company that could help millions of people every year.&nbsp; Oprah Winfrey talked openly about her experiences of being sexually abused, starting at nine years old.&nbsp; Reframing her experiences enabled her to become not just a television celebrity, but a caring leader whose mission is to help people take responsibility for their lives.</p><p align=\"justify\">In my case it took a series of crucibles before I learned that my mission was not to become CEO of a global company, but to build an organization that could help other people through its life-saving products.&nbsp; In my teenage years, I was trying so hard to be a leader that I lost seven elections in a row.&nbsp; Thanks to a caring group in my college fraternity, I learned that my ambitions and selfish ways were blocking my ability to use my leadership gifts.&nbsp; Understanding that was the easy part; much more difficult was developing into a leader who truly cared about serving other people.&nbsp; In my mid-twenties the back-to-back deaths of my mother and my fiancée brought me to the depth of loneliness that caused me to explore deeply what life is all about. But it was not until I “hit the wall” in my career at Honeywell in my mid-forties that I finally recognized the deeper purpose of my leadership.&nbsp; It was not just to be CEO, but to join a unique company like Medtronic whose mission was to restore people to full life and health.&nbsp; Had it not been for the counsel and advice of my wife Penny, my close friend Doug Baker, my men’s group, and my couple’s group, I might never have come to that realization.</p><h2 align=\"justify\">New Leadership for the 21st Century</h2><p align=\"justify\">All of these very human stories lead to the unmistakable conclusion that we need a new kind of leader to lead our institutions in the 21st century – a leader who can empower and inspire others to lead.&nbsp; The 20th century vision of a leader who commands the troops to follow him over the hill to build his glory is dead – or it should be!</p><p align=\"justify\">Coming out of two world wars in the 1950s, we idolized all-powerful leaders like General George Patton, in spite of their evident flaws and abusive tendencies.&nbsp; We dichotomized leaders and workers, with the latter being mere cogs in the wheels of production.&nbsp; As a nineteen-year-old industrial engineering student in the 1960s, I used my stopwatch to study the motions of 55-year-old machine tool workers.&nbsp; Then I gratuitously advised them on how to become more efficient, without ever asking them how to make their work more effective and meaningful.&nbsp; That was the nature of the assembly line in those days.&nbsp; In the last two decades of the 20th century we developed a national obsession with the all-powerful charismatic leader at the top.</p><p align=\"justify\">It is high time that we cast off these images of the all-powerful leaders on top, who dominate their subordinates with power, intimidation, and a directive style.&nbsp; We do not need leaders who treat the people as a cost of doing business rather than the basis for the business’ success.&nbsp; No longer can we tolerate leaders who increase earnings by eliminating what has made the organization successful, while they personally reap hundreds of millions in compensation.&nbsp; Employees, customers, investors, and the public at large have every reason <em>not</em> to trust these vestiges of failed 20th century leadership.</p><em>not</em><p align=\"justify\">Leadership in this new century <em>must</em> change precisely because the nature of people in organizations has changed.&nbsp; People today are more knowledgeable about their jobs than their bosses are.&nbsp; They are demanding meaning and significance from their work, and are not willing to toil away just for someone else’s benefit.&nbsp; They want to lead now, not wait in line for ten to twenty years until they are tapped for a leadership role.</p><em>must</em><p align=\"justify\">Why shouldn’t they expect and demand this level of respect and meaning?&nbsp; Why shouldn’t you?</p><ul>\n<li>You can discover your authentic leadership right now.</li>\n<li>You do not have to be born with the characteristics or traits of a leader.</li>\n<li>You do not have to wait for a tap on the shoulder.</li>\n<li>You can step up to lead at any point in your life.</li>\n<li>You are never too young – or too old.</li>\n<li>As Stephen Covey has said, “Leadership is your choice, <em>not</em> your title.”</li>\n</ul><li>You can discover your authentic leadership right now.</li><li>You do not have to be born with the characteristics or traits of a leader.</li><li>You do not have to wait for a tap on the shoulder.</li><li>You can step up to lead at any point in your life.</li><li>You are never too young – or too old.</li><li>As Stephen Covey has said, “Leadership is your choice, <em>not</em> your title.”</li><em>not</em><p align=\"justify\">I would like to offer a new definition of successful 21st century leaders.&nbsp; They are <em>authentic leaders who bring people together around a shared mission and values and empower them to lead, in order to serve their customers while creating value for all their stakeholders. </em></p><em>authentic leaders who bring people together around a shared mission and values and empower them to lead, in order to serve their customers while creating value for all their stakeholders. </em><p align=\"justify\">From reading the press these days, one gets the impression that most of our leaders are greedy people who are out to feather their own nests.&nbsp; For all the negative publicity they generate, I am pleased to say such leaders these days are the exception, <em>not</em> the rule.&nbsp; There is an entirely new generation of authentic leaders stepping up to lead our organizations.&nbsp; These leaders recognize the value of bringing people together around a shared mission and values and empowering leaders at all levels.&nbsp; In particular, I am impressed with the group of leaders that have stepped into top roles since the fall of Enron, such as Jeff Immelt of GE, Anne Mulcahy of Xerox, A. G. Lafley of Procter &amp; Gamble, Sam Palmisano of IBM, Andrea Jung of Avon, Kevin Sharer of Amgen, and Ann Fudge of Young &amp; Rubicam, as well as non-profit leaders like Wendy Kopp of Teach For America and Nancy Barry of Women’s World Bank.</p><em>not</em><p align=\"justify\">Let me make this prediction: successful organizations in the 21st century will be those that get the best out of people by motivating them with an inspiring mission and empower people at all levels of the organization.&nbsp; This is why for-profit organizations like Target, P&amp;G, Best Buy, J&amp;J, GE, Wells Fargo, Amgen, and PepsiCo are so successful and are able to sustain their success, year after year.</p><h2 align=\"justify\">True North: Discovering Your Authentic Leadership</h2><p align=\"justify\">I wrote my new book, <em>True North</em>, to answer the question, “How do you become an authentic leader?”&nbsp; The answer is that it takes years of hard work and development.&nbsp; The key is knowing the “True North” of your internal compass, and then preparing to stay on course in spite of the challenges and seductions that cause so many leaders to go astray.</p><em>True North</em><p align=\"justify\">Your True North represents who you are as a human being at your deepest level.&nbsp; It is your orienting point – your fixed point in a spinning world – that helps you stay on track as a leader.&nbsp; Your True North is based on your most cherished values, your passions and motivations, and the sources of satisfaction in your life. When you follow your True North, your leadership will be authentic, and people will naturally want to associate with you.</p><p align=\"justify\">Discovering your True North takes a lifetime of commitment and learning.&nbsp; Each day, as you are tested in the real world, you yearn to look at yourself in the mirror and respect the person you see and the life you have chosen to lead.&nbsp; As long as you are true to who you are, you can cope with the most difficult circumstances that life presents.</p><p align=\"justify\">In reality, other people will have very different expectations for your leadership than you have for yourself.&nbsp; You will be pressured by external forces to respond to their needs and seduced by rewards for fulfilling them.&nbsp; These pressures and seductions may cause you to detour from your True North.&nbsp; When you get too far off course, your internal compass tells you something is wrong and you need to reorient yourself.&nbsp; It requires strength of character, courage and resolve to resist these constant pressures and take corrective action when necessary.</p><p align=\"justify\">When you are aligned with who you are, you sense coherence between your life story and your leadership.&nbsp; As psychologist William James wrote a century ago, “The best way to define a person’s character is to seek out the time when he felt most deeply and intensively active and alive; when he could hear his inner voice saying, ‘This is the real me.’”</p><p align=\"justify\">Can you recall a time when you felt most intensely alive and could say with confidence, “This is the real me”?&nbsp; When you can, you are aligned with your True North and prepared to lead others authentically.&nbsp; In my own case I had that precise feeling the first time I walked into Medtronic in 1989, and felt I could be myself and be appreciated for who I was and what I could contribute.</p><h2 align=\"justify\">Developing as an Authentic Leader</h2><p align=\"justify\">Becoming an authentic leader is a long journey that takes hard work on your part, just as it does to become a virtuoso violin player or a champion athlete.&nbsp; As GE’s Jeff Immelt told us, “Leadership is one of those great journeys into your soul.&nbsp; It’s not like anyone can tell you how to do it.”</p><p align=\"justify\">In studying leaders who have failed, I realized that their failure resulted from their inability to lead themselves.&nbsp; As we discerned from our interviews, <em>the hardest person you will ever have to lead is yourself.</em> When you can lead yourself through the challenges and difficulties, you will find that leading others becomes relatively straight-forward.</p><em>the hardest person you will ever have to lead is yourself.</em><p align=\"justify\">We learned that there are six principal areas required to lead yourself:</p><ul>\n<li>\n<ol>\n<li>Gaining self-awareness;</li>\n<li>Practicing your values and principles under pressure;</li>\n<li>Balancing your extrinsic and intrinsic motivations;</li>\n<li>Building your support team;</li>\n<li>Staying grounded by integrating your life; and</li>\n<li>Understanding your passions and purpose of your leadership.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul><li>\n<ol>\n<li>Gaining self-awareness;</li>\n<li>Practicing your values and principles under pressure;</li>\n<li>Balancing your extrinsic and intrinsic motivations;</li>\n<li>Building your support team;</li>\n<li>Staying grounded by integrating your life; and</li>\n<li>Understanding your passions and purpose of your leadership.</li>\n</ol>\n</li><ol>\n<li>Gaining self-awareness;</li>\n<li>Practicing your values and principles under pressure;</li>\n<li>Balancing your extrinsic and intrinsic motivations;</li>\n<li>Building your support team;</li>\n<li>Staying grounded by integrating your life; and</li>\n<li>Understanding your passions and purpose of your leadership.</li>\n</ol><li>Gaining self-awareness;</li><li>Practicing your values and principles under pressure;</li><li>Balancing your extrinsic and intrinsic motivations;</li><li>Building your support team;</li><li>Staying grounded by integrating your life; and</li><li>Understanding your passions and purpose of your leadership.</li><h3 align=\"justify\">Self-Awareness:</h3><p align=\"justify\">It may take a lifetime to gain complete awareness of yourself, but your self-knowledge can be accelerated by honest feedback from others.&nbsp; In his mid-thirties, Doug Baker, Jr. was a rising star at Ecolab who had taken over the company’s newly acquired subsidiary in North Carolina.&nbsp; Through his early success, Baker had become arrogant and self-centered.&nbsp; Then he got some tough feedback from his subordinates that told him all of this and more.&nbsp; Baker calls getting the unexpected criticism “a cathartic experience.”&nbsp; He explained, “It was as if someone flashed a mirror in front of me at my absolute worst.&nbsp; What I saw was horrifying, but it was also a great lesson.&nbsp; After that, I did a lot of soul-searching about what kind of leader I was going to be, talked to everyone on my Ecolab team about what I had learned, and asked them for their help.”&nbsp; Baker’s self-awareness is a critical factor in the success he is realizing since becoming CEO of Ecolab nine years later.</p><h3 align=\"justify\">Practicing Your Values:</h3><p align=\"justify\">The key to your values is <em>not</em> what you say you believe in, or even how you behave when things are going well.&nbsp; You really find out what your values are when you are under pressure or things are not going your way.</p><em>not</em><p align=\"justify\">Today Jon Huntsman is the successful founder of Huntsman Chemical, leader of a 73-person family, and a bishop in his Mormon church.&nbsp; In 1973 he was a young staffer working for President Nixon’s notoriously powerful chief of staff, Bob Haldeman.&nbsp; One day Haldeman directed Huntsman to carry out an undercover sting operation involving illegal immigrants designed to embarrass a Congressman opposing Nixon’s initiatives.&nbsp; At first, Huntsman went along with the game, calling the plant manager to give him instructions.&nbsp; He recalled, “There are times when we react too quickly and fail to realize immediately what is right and wrong.&nbsp; This was one of those times when I didn’t think it through.&nbsp; After fifteen minutes, my inner moral compass kicked in and I told the plant manager, ‘Forget that I called.&nbsp; I don’t want to play this game.’”&nbsp; Huntsman recognized that rejecting the orders of the second most powerful person in the country would be viewed as disloyal and his White House career would be over.&nbsp; “So be it,” he said, “I quit in the next six months.”</p><h3 align=\"justify\">Balancing Your Motivations:</h3><p align=\"justify\">It is not surprising that leaders like promotions, bonuses and pay increases, and recognition from their peers and the media.&nbsp; But if these motivations dominate their passions, they are at risk of derailing, sooner or later.&nbsp; Authentic leaders recognize their intrinsic motivations like helping others, making a difference in the world, and building organizations with purpose and meaning.&nbsp;&nbsp; The important thing is not to deny your extrinsic motivations, but to balance them with intrinsic motivations.</p><p align=\"justify\">Kevin Sharer was a rising star at General Electric at age 41, general manager of its satellite business, and on Jack Welch’s “high potential list.”&nbsp; When the search firms proposed to Kevin that he join MCI with a faster route to the top, he jumped at the opportunity, leaving Welch unhappy with his sudden departure.&nbsp; Once at MCI, Kevin learned quickly that the COO was in line for the top slot and didn’t welcome the new hotshot from GE.&nbsp; His “know-it-all” attitude didn’t help either, especially when he proposed reorganizing the company.&nbsp; Sharer’s crucible at MCI proved invaluable to him: caught up in the glamour of being a rising star, he was brought down to reality and forced to recognize what really motivated him.&nbsp; When the opportunity to become COO of Amgen arose, a chastened Sharer recognized the importance of Amgen’s work in saving lives.&nbsp; He earnestly studied biology and the biotech business for seven years before becoming CEO.&nbsp; By then, he was able to balance his extrinsic motivations with the intrinsic satisfactions that Amgen’s mission provided him.</p><h3 align=\"justify\">Building Your Support Team:</h3><p align=\"justify\">An essential element of staying focused on your True North is to build a support team that can help you stay on track.&nbsp; Your team starts with having at least one person in your life with whom you can be completely open and honest.&nbsp; It could be your spouse, best friend, mentor, or therapist.&nbsp; In my case, that person is my wife Penny, who is largely responsible for whatever success I have enjoyed. She keeps me on track, especially when I get caught up in selfish desires.&nbsp; Your family and your best friends also help you stay grounded, especially when you most need their help.&nbsp; Having a mentor who can give you straight feedback can be invaluable.</p><p align=\"justify\">I also believe in having a support group of your peers with whom you can share openly and who will be there for you when you most need them.&nbsp; I have been blessed with having a men’s group with whom I have been meeting every Wednesday morning for the last thirty years, as well as a couples group that Penny and I helped form twenty years ago.&nbsp; These two groups of people (most of whom are here today) have been there for me – and I hope I for them – when I most needed their support.&nbsp; When Penny was diagnosed with breast cancer eleven years ago, they were there to support both of us through the difficult times that followed.</p><p align=\"justify\">The reality is you cannot wait to build your support team until you are facing difficulty.&nbsp; The time to do it is now, because long-term, deep relationships and shared life histories take decades to build.</p><h3 align=\"justify\">Staying Grounded by Integrating Your Life:</h3><p align=\"justify\">Every leader I know is facing the challenges of meeting all their commitments in life – their jobs, their families and their communities as well as preserving time for their personal life.&nbsp; I can assure you, this isn’t getting any easier.&nbsp; The work week seems to be increasing, just as the demands of families, friends and communities are rising.&nbsp; How do you stay grounded with all the pressures coming at you?&nbsp; I think the key is maintaining your integrity by being the same person in all these environments, and not letting your leadership commitments at work pull you away from the fullness of life.&nbsp; This isn’t easy, but it can be done by making choices and setting boundaries, and <em>not</em> selling your soul to your job.&nbsp; If you don’t do these things, you may become a shooting star that burns out long before you have the opportunity to fulfill your leadership dreams.</p><em>not</em><p align=\"justify\">Your Passions Reveal the Purpose of Your Leadership:</p><p align=\"justify\">Finally, when you understand the passions that emanate from your life story, you will discover the purpose of your leadership. In other words, your True North will become clear.&nbsp; I learned that when I made the decision to leave Honeywell and join Medtronic.</p><h3 align=\"justify\">Empowering People to Lead:</h3><p align=\"justify\">Developing yourself as these leaders have done is not an easy task.&nbsp; It is a marathon, not a sprint, to gain self-awareness, solidify your values, balance your motivations, build your support team, integrate your life, and understand the purpose of your leadership.&nbsp; As you do so, you will find that leading others is relatively straight-forward.&nbsp; By being authentic and true to your beliefs, you can unite people around a common purpose and set of values and empower them to step up and lead.&nbsp; That’s what the best 21st century leaders are doing, and the reason why their organizations, over the long-term, far outperform organizations led by people still operating in the 20th century mold.</p><p align=\"justify\">An example of just such an empowering 21st century leader is Marilyn Nelson, CEO of the Carlson Companies.&nbsp; When Nelson took over leadership from her father, she recognized the culture of Carlson had to change dramatically if it was going to succeed in this century.&nbsp; She decided to reinvent Carlson as a company that cared for customers by creating the most caring environment for its employees.&nbsp; To build the new culture, Nelson went on a personal crusade to bring her message of empowerment to Carlson employees around the world.&nbsp; In her personal interactions she carried with her the memories of her daughter’s tragic death, in an automobile accident years before, as she vowed to “give back and make life better for people.”</p><h2 align=\"justify\">Your Call to Experience the Fulfillment of True North Leadership:</h2><p align=\"justify\">When we examine organizations that are led by empowering leaders, we realize that we do not have a shortage of leaders after all.&nbsp; In every organization there are many, many leaders just waiting for the opportunity to lead.</p><p align=\"justify\">My advice is, don’t wait to be asked.&nbsp; You can step up and lead right now.&nbsp; Your organization will be far better off because you did.&nbsp; In thinking about whether to take on the leadership challenges, ask yourself these two simple questions: <em>If not me, then who?&nbsp; If not now, then when?</em></p><em>If not me, then who?&nbsp; If not now, then when?</em><p align=\"justify\">Many people are hesitant to lead because they fear failure, criticism, or think they are not capable.&nbsp; My plea to you today is to overcome these fears, for there is nothing more fulfilling than leadership.&nbsp; You <em>are</em> capable of leading, and the experience is well worth any risks you may take or criticism you may endure.</p><em>are</em><p align=\"justify\">As President Theodore Roosevelt said in his famous 1908 address,</p><p align=\"justify\"><em>It is not the critic that counts.&nbsp; The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows the triumph of high achievement and who if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</em></p><em>It is not the critic that counts.&nbsp; The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows the triumph of high achievement and who if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</em><p align=\"justify\">Are you prepared to enter that arena, to dare greatly, and to spend yourself in a worthy cause? If you are, in the end you will know the triumph of high achievement and you will experience the fulfillment of leadership.</p><p align=\"justify\">You will know the joy of working with a passionate group of people toward shared goals, of confronting challenges and overcoming barriers, and of leaving a legacy to the world through your leadership.&nbsp; There is no satisfaction in your professional life that can compare to this sense of fulfillment.</p><p align=\"justify\">You will have the satisfaction of knowing that you followed your True North, you discovered your authentic leadership, and the world is a better place because of you.&nbsp; That is the fulfillment of being a True North leader.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong>Below are the highlights of Bill George’s question-and-answer session with Bentley students, faculty and invited guests.</strong></p><strong>Below are the highlights of Bill George’s question-and-answer session with Bentley students, faculty and invited guests.</strong><p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Question</em></strong></p><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>Question</em><p align=\"justify\">How do you feel that college students, about to go into the business world, would best prepare to become moral leaders?</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Bill George</em></strong></p><strong><em>Bill George</em></strong><em>Bill George</em><p align=\"justify\">I would say get engaged in leadership right here at Bentley.&nbsp; Don’t wait, take the opportunity.&nbsp; I had some of my best leadership experiences early on in college.&nbsp; Once I’d gone into the business world, it took a little while to get those opportunities again because at the beginning of your career you’re an individual contributor, an analyst or something like that.&nbsp; So take advantage of the opportunity here.&nbsp; Getting involved in leadership in service organizations outside the campus is also a great opportunity in learning how to lead; with volunteers, you really learn how to lead people, more than when you control people’s livelihoods, their incomes and their bonuses.&nbsp; I got some of my best leadership experience from my college fraternity, probably because I was leading peers; the strongest feedback – a lot of that negative feedback I mentioned earlier – came from my peers.&nbsp; I spend a lot of time looking for an organization that can replicate the leadership experience in college. So I’d say step up and lead right now.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Question</em></strong></p><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>Question</em><p align=\"justify\">You said that several people you interviewed for your book [<em>True North: Discovering Your Authentic Leadership</em>] were international. Could you comment on whether there were any significant differences in the responses of, say, Asian, European and American leaders?</p><em>True North: Discovering Your Authentic Leadership</em><p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Bill George</em></strong></p><strong><em>Bill George</em></strong><em>Bill George</em><p align=\"justify\">I think there are significant cultural differences in leadership.&nbsp; One of the people we interviewed is Narayana Murthy, the recently-retired CEO [and now Chairman of the Board] of Infosys, a global consulting and IT services company based in Bangalore, India.&nbsp; They do outsourcing of software services. When Mr. Murthy founded Infosys he said he was going to create a different kind of company – he called it “compassionate capitalism.”&nbsp; In other words, the company would have compassion for the people they serve.&nbsp; It’s not much different from what I’m advocating for this country.&nbsp; But I think in India and China – I was teaching Chinese executives – you see much more of that concern for other people.&nbsp; I think the closer you get to Wall Street, the more you think in terms of transactions and numbers, and less of the human side of business.&nbsp; In India and China they seem less taken with some of the theoretical economists who promote bottom-line short-term value.</p><p align=\"justify\">The Europeans, I think, have a way to go to pull out of more tradition-bound, more hierarchical environments.&nbsp; It’s harder for them sometimes, particularly in Germany, to open up to some of these ideas.&nbsp; I think you see in the smaller countries much more openness to the empowering style of leadership.&nbsp; I think that’s why oftentimes the executives from countries like Switzerland, the Netherlands, Belgium, or the Scandinavian countries do much better than the big country leaders, who tend to be more hierarchical; they’re trained in that way.</p><p align=\"justify\">Now, the Americans have a lot of freedom to be truly innovative.&nbsp; That’s why Silicon Valley has done so unbelievably well; it’s why Route 128 out here did so well. There are so many opportunities to be innovative.&nbsp; The freedom of the American system is something that a lot of other people around the world are trying to emulate right now.&nbsp; But don’t underestimate their ability to emulate it.&nbsp; They may do it very, very well.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Question </em></strong></p><strong><em>Question </em></strong><em>Question </em><p align=\"justify\">How did you feel when you made the move from Honeywell to Medtronic?&nbsp; Did the idea of being a bigger fish in a smaller pond appeal to you?</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Bill George</em></strong></p><strong><em>Bill George</em></strong><em>Bill George</em><p align=\"justify\">I became number two at Medtronic when I went there. The whole business was a third of the size of the one I was running at Honeywell, and about a ninth of the size of the overall company of Honeywell.&nbsp; So I felt like I was going to a much smaller company.&nbsp; We had to create a lot of the processes and procedures and, frankly, we had to improve the leadership.&nbsp; But, at the same time, it wasn’t hidebound with a lot of tradition and bureaucracy.&nbsp; I’m just someone who doesn’t deal well with a lot of bureaucracy.&nbsp; I’m too impatient – it’s one of my weaknesses.&nbsp; I just don’t want to play the game.&nbsp; Honeywell had gotten quite political, and I don’t like a political organization.&nbsp; So, as I’d watch people try to be political at Medtronic, I’d call them to my office and say, “Look, this is not how we’re going to do things here, so knock it off.”</p><p align=\"justify\">Yes, we created systems at Medtronic, but I like freedom of action; the freedom to create the kinds of products that can change cerebral palsy – which we did – or change Parkinson’s disease.&nbsp; It might take you 10 years, but people are so motivated to do that.&nbsp; By contrast, in Honeywell there was too much tradition and the mavericks were pushed out.&nbsp; In Medtronic we try to include them more.&nbsp; It’s not that bigger companies can’t be that way but I think it’s more of a challenge for them.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Question</em></strong></p><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>Question</em><p align=\"justify\">In your opinion, here in the United States, who do you think are some of the best business leaders?&nbsp; Who are among the worst, and why?</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Bill George</em></strong></p><strong><em>Bill George</em></strong><em>Bill George</em><p align=\"justify\">I’ve mentioned many of the ones that I think are the best.&nbsp; People like Anne Mulcahy, Andrea Jung, Jeff Immelt and Sam Palmisano are terrific.&nbsp; But there are a lot of small company leaders who are just fantastic.&nbsp; I mentioned Doug Baker, CEO of Ecolab. Marilyn Carlson Nelson, who runs the Carlson Companies, is an awesome leader.&nbsp; We interviewed a lot of Silicon Valley leaders.&nbsp; John Donahoe, who is number two to Meg Whitman at eBay, is a fantastic leader.&nbsp; I think we’re seeing more people, in their 40s, sometimes their 30s, perhaps even younger, getting the opportunity to lead and really doing it well – not just in an authentic way but in a very dynamic way so that people really want to be associated with them.</p><p align=\"justify\">So I’m very cynical about people getting paid to fail.&nbsp; It’s another thing when they’re making a lot of money if they’re succeeding – that’s the American way.&nbsp; Howard Schultz [Starbucks] makes a lot of money but he earns it – and he put in his own money, his own sweat and equity.&nbsp; I think Bill Gates is fantastic; look how he’s giving his money back right now.&nbsp; Warren Buffet, a great human being, is also giving his money back.&nbsp; He said, “I don’t know how to give it away, so I’ll let Gates give it away.”&nbsp; These are the kind of people that I hold up as role models for all of us, as people who are really in it to give back.&nbsp; I resent the idea that we pay people outrageous sums of money that fail.&nbsp; They should walk away with nothing, they really should.&nbsp; CEOs should be the most at risk.&nbsp; Why should we put the first-line workers at risk?&nbsp; They’re the ones that lose their jobs while CEO’s walk away with these payoffs for failing – I think it’s wrong.&nbsp; In fact, I don’t think CEOs should get contracts; they should be at risk. Why not?&nbsp; They have the most control, the most freedom and the opportunity to make the most.&nbsp; It’s got to work both ways; it can’t be a one-way street.&nbsp; If we don’t correct this problem, we’re going to end up with laws being passed that restrict what people can make, and I don’t think that’s right either.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Question</em></strong></p><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>Question</em><p align=\"justify\">How do you measure the success of a leader while the leader is in the making?&nbsp; Clearly, meeting the analyst estimates of increasing market cap’ is not a good guide.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Bill George</em></strong></p><strong><em>Bill George</em></strong><em>Bill George</em><p align=\"justify\">I bet I can sit with most people in this room for half an hour and tell you whether they’ll be leaders.&nbsp; You see if they have that spark, that passion.&nbsp; Are they real or are they still working on it?&nbsp; Some of you may still be working issues through; you might not come across as a leader now, but you may emerge as a great leader in 5 or 10 years because you’ve worked through some difficult issues.</p><p align=\"justify\">I think you measure leaders on how people in the organization feel.&nbsp; That’s a sign of good leadership – people feel they can really make a difference in their organization. An organization of empowered people is what you want to have.&nbsp; I test how the subordinates feel.&nbsp; I used to get trapped by people who are very impressive, who make a great presentation.&nbsp; They look good, they look sharp, they always have the right answer, and are really quick.&nbsp; And sometimes you promote them and then ask, “Why did I promote <em>that</em> guy?&nbsp; He’s terrible.”&nbsp; So I’ve learned you should never promote anyone until you find out what their subordinates think.&nbsp; They’ll tell you.&nbsp; Or do a 360 feedback, like Doug Baker.&nbsp; That’s when you find out whether you’re a good leader or not.</p><em>that</em><p align=\"justify\">I think people in an organization know whether leaders are good.&nbsp; People know what’s going on.&nbsp; The formal organization sometimes promotes the wrong people for the wrong reasons because they put short-term numbers on the bottom line, but they may be destroying organizations while they’re doing it.&nbsp; Those are the leaders you have to watch out for because they’ll destroy your company.&nbsp; It’ll be like a cancer spreading throughout the company because everyone else will think, “We have to be like that guy?&nbsp; He’s getting ahead.&nbsp; What does that say about me being the way I am?”&nbsp; And this can be very destructive in organizations.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Question</em></strong></p><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>Question</em><p align=\"justify\">I was interested to hear you say that you had been a turnaround manager, and that eventually it made you miserable.&nbsp; I wonder if you could talk a little bit about being a turnaround manager because they are a certain type.&nbsp; I think the stereotype is that they have to do things to the organization that some people would even say are unethical, that they cause pain and cause harm – sort of being cruel to be kind to bring an organization back.&nbsp; Could you elaborate on that?</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Bill George</em></strong></p><strong><em>Bill George</em></strong><em>Bill George</em><p align=\"justify\">Business is faced with a lot of tough decisions.&nbsp; And, actually, I think terminating people who aren’t doing well on their job, or moving them to a job where they can do better, is doing them a favor.&nbsp; At the time, they don’t feel like that.&nbsp; They feel like you’ve betrayed them because they don’t like being booted out.&nbsp; But a lot of times you’re doing them a <em>huge</em> favor.&nbsp; In turnarounds, you often have to lay people off.&nbsp; It’s like when you want to get your body healthy again, you have to take some pain to do that.&nbsp; But that’s the only way you can get healthy, so I am very much in favor of that.&nbsp; I believe you have to stay competitive.&nbsp; Aaron Feuerstein in Malden Mills never kept his company competitive because he wouldn’t outsource.&nbsp; We outsourced at Medtronic and the company employment in the U. S. kept growing because we gained market share as we became more competitive.&nbsp; We brought out lots of products and hired everyone other than pure production workers.&nbsp; I think some pain is very important in organizations right now.&nbsp; Trimming out the fat in organizations is very important.&nbsp; I don’t like just being a turnaround specialist who goes from one to the next to the next because I see myself as a builder.&nbsp; There are people who do that and are very good at it.&nbsp; But that’s not how I want to spend my life, and that’s what I was facing.&nbsp; I was becoming known as a turnaround specialist because it’s not how I see myself.&nbsp; I also think as you’re growing, sometimes you should take a step back and lose a little weight, trim up a little bit.</p><em>huge</em><p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Question</em></strong></p><strong><em>Question</em></strong><em>Question</em><p align=\"justify\">You’ve said a lot about how as an individual, you have to find your “True North” and, as a leader, help others to find theirs.&nbsp;&nbsp; How do you go beyond that as a leader, to help organizations to find their “True North”?&nbsp; I’m thinking in terms of the focus, in the last few years, on corporate culture and how that, besides individual character flaws, has been responsible for much of the trouble we’ve seen.</p><p align=\"justify\"><strong><em>Bill George</em></strong></p><strong><em>Bill George</em></strong><em>Bill George</em><p align=\"justify\">I think you need to gain an alignment around the purpose of the organization – whether it’s Johnson &amp; Johnson’s Credo, the Medtronic mission, Starbucks’ idea of creating a great place to be, or Target’s vision of fashion-forward merchandise and great value.&nbsp; You need to create alignment around a sense of purpose for people.&nbsp; People need to know that’s the purpose of the organization – let’s come together around that.&nbsp; People need to be clear about what the values are.&nbsp; If we’re not going to pay bribes, then that means we don’t pay bribes period.&nbsp; We don’t do it to get a big contract in Saudi Arabia; we just don’t do it – that’s the way we behave. Getting that alignment is how you build a healthy organization.&nbsp;&nbsp; You can get that level of commitment to the organization.&nbsp; You can foster pride in the organization, that sense of building the organization’s reputation and getting everyone moving together in the same direction.&nbsp; Then people can have the freedom to go out and take the creative actions.&nbsp; They know they won’t get fired because they had a little failure, and can take action to build a great organization.&nbsp; But I think it’s only through that alignment that you empower the people within the organization.&nbsp; It’s not just anarchy, where everyone is going off in different directions.&nbsp; It’s that they’re brought together by that common vision and common set of values.</p>"

The  insider trading trial is set to begin Monday in Denver of Joseph  Nacchio, once upon a time the CEO of the telephone company Qwest. Qwest  retirees are among the many who were left holding the bag after what the  government called a massive accounting fraud.</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> Among the issues raised by the trial is to what extent corporate CEOs  are prone to abandoning the rules of right and wrong that apply to the  rest of us…sometimes destroying their companies, their communities,  and the environment in the process.</p><p> For a critical look at the larger issue of what is wrong with capitalism  and how to fix it, we turn to a player in this realm…Bill George was  the CEO of the fortune 500 medical products company Medtronics and  teaches ethics and leadership at the Harvard Business School. George has  done a lot of thinking and writing about what he sees as a crisis in  corporate leadership. His new book is called “True North.”</p><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> Bill, thanks for coming in.</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> Great to be here David.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> You’ve written that you can’t legislate, and this  means regulations, you can’t legislate integrity in a business leader.  You can’t legislate stewardship or—or sound governance. I want to ask  you about that. It’s a central thesis of your writing. Is it really  true? I mean you can legislate against robbing banks, and people tend  not to.</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> But people find ways around that. And that—if the whole  game is how do you beat the rules, that’s the wrong game to play. And I  think the real problem in the 90s, the thing—the reason I’m writing  books, and—and speaking out and teaching at Harvard and things like  that, David, is because I’m so concerned with those CEOs in my  generation who—stretched it—again to play the game.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> And I think we’ve been choosing boards of directors and choosing many of  the wrong leaders for the wrong reason. We choose people for their  image, their charisma—their style.</p><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> Well, where does that lead, if it’s all about charisma and the—the—the recognition factor of the single CEO?</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> But that’s not what it should be—what it—you know, that’s  leading right to a destructive tendency. Leadership is not about having  everyone follow you over the hill. You know, leadership is about  empowering people in your organization to lead. That’s not by  charismatic. That’s having character. People trust you ’cause you have  character. They trust your integrity. They believe in you that you know  what you’re doing. And they’re gonna be empowered to lead inside the  organization. Great organizations have thousands, tens of thousands of  leaders. Not one great person at the top.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> I mean, isn’t—leadership something that’s built very early in somebody’s life, if it’s not inherited?</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> Well, I don’t think people go into business to be  corrupt. And so it’s not like the—we—we have people with bad values  going into business. I think what happens is a lot of people, very well  intentioned, who know what they believe in, get, if not corrupted by the  system, they get seduced by it, or they—they yield to the pressures.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> But this notion that people don’t go into business to do the wrong thing, let me just slightly push you on this.</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> Yeah.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> A buddy of mine recently retired from a brand name business school. He was on the faculty.</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> Yeah.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> At a big one, ’til recently. And he said something  that verges on the obnoxious. And I’m gonna run it past you. He’s of the  mind that business schools too often train, reward and nurture and  promote, he says, listen to this word: sociopaths. People who are so  focused on success narrowly defined that they ultimately will move on to  —have antisocial effects.</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> Well, there surely has been some of that. And that’s  what—of course that’s my courses at Harvard, I’m trying to teach to  offset that. Not to teach, but to get people to get grounded in what  they believe in.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> And it is tempting when the recruiters come and wave hundreds of  thousands of dollars in front of them for—just for signing on the dotted  line. And you can be seduced. But the end of all that, you’re not gonna  wind up being fulfilled.</p><p> And you may go off and you may lose your way, and you may destroy  everything you’ve built up. And so I think it’s the role of business  schools to rethink this issue, and to focus on leadership, and how do  you build leadership for the future?</p><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> Do you sometimes feel like a lone voice on this issue?</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> Well, there are a lot of forces going the other way.  There are a lot of forces arguing for big money being made in the short  term. The hedge funds are certainly—an example of the high pressure,  fast money.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> But you—did some investigations, you looked around,  and, you actually did find some people out there, in positions of power  in American business, who —took a different path.</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> Well, we found a lot. We interviewed 125 people. And I  find, particularly among those CEOs that have become CEO since the fall  of—of Enron if—if you will, since the—Sarbanes Oxley bill, they get it.  And they realize leadership is not about aggrandizing themselves.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> They’re in it to build for the long term. They’re not there for the  short term. They want a ten year run to build a really great  organization.</p><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> But what’s the argument? I thought capitalism was about maximizing the return for shareholders.</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> The question is in what time frame. Unfortunately, it’s  not taking any less time to transform an organization to produce a drug,  to create great new technology, whether it’s the iPod, or the  microprocessor that Intel creates. They’ll still take a long time. A new  biotech drug coming out of Amgen. That takes ten, 12, 14 years.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> That hasn’t shortened. But if the shareholders are only in the game for  the short term. And they’re really interested in short term bump in your  stock and come back down, you have a collision of forces.</p><p> And that’s what’s concerning. But if you got people just buying and  selling stocks everyday, looking for a quick short term gain, you don’t  have that old time shareholder commitment.</p><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> I heard a—fascinating—legislative solution to some of  this the other day from—none other than the CEO of Whole Foods Markets.  He’s kicking around this idea of you want to promote the notion of  holding shares longer term, and to get away from the short term stuff?  Why not get rid of the capital gains tax on stocks that you hold for a—a  longish time, say five years. Essentially assessing a penalty for those  people trading quickly.</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> I—I think it’d be great if capital gains tax started out  high. If you sell, by and sell in less than a year, and go all the way  to ten years and you have no capital gains tax, I think that would  really encourage long-term holding. Because I’m convinced that it’s only  through the long-term investments that you build great value.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> Let’s talk about executive compensation i<br>\nn this  country. Some of the figures I saw, fairly recently, was that CEOs in  America were being paid about 400 times the average working salary. Many  Americans think things are getting a little out of whack.</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><br><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> What really upsets me is people getting rewarded for  failing. For, you know, you go out and hire a charismatic high profile  CEO. Wall Street loves it. Stock price goes up. You bring someone in,  and he fails. And the next thing you know you’re paying him a couple  hundred million dollars so that he’ll go away. Now that’s a disaster.  Everyone loses in that. And I think it’s—it’s a big concern. Now I don’t  want to legislate it, but I think boards have to be very, very  responsible about compensation of their executives.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> But you don’t want to legislate to fix this problem.  What you’re arguing for is some sort of enlightenment to happen among,  for instance, boards of directors.</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> Right.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> Is it really possible?</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> It is. And you’ll find that the CEOs that get promoted  from within are quite—much more reasonably paid. Because they came up  from within. but I think boards haven’t done the job in finding leaders  inside the company.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> But that’s what we need. We need people who know how to motivate and inspire people to step up and lead inside the organization.</p><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> But an enlightened CEO, as you see it, needs to  operate within a system that doesn’t—give out rewards for bad behavior.  It has to set up a system that makes it possible to succeed if you have  this wider vision.</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> And are there rewards given for short-term behavior or  long term? And I—I would contend that the higher up you go, the longer  term the rewards should be</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> But I think it’s a good thing to have a long-term game. And I think, you  know, you never sell a share of your company stock until after you  leave. And you hold onto it after that because you ensure that you have a  good successor. That’s what real capitalism is about. Creating  long-term value.</p><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> You want people in power, in corporate America, who  have this wider view of the purpose of a company, longer term view. And,  to some extent, you’re arguing for well adjusted grown ups to have the  reins of power.</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> Leaders, first of all, have to develop themselves. And  all the leaders that I’ve seen, who have failed, have failed to lead  themselves. Not they can’t lead other people. They aren’t well grounded.  And I think staying grounded is one of the hardest tasks any leader has  to do.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> Grounded? What do you mean?</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> Well, you’re grounded in your values. You know what you  believe. And if you get pressure from the outside world, do this, do  that, (NOISE) you say no. I know what I believe.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> You need people around you who will reinforce. Will tell you—tell it  like it is. Tell you when you’re going off. I have a wife who does that  for me. And she says, “Bill, you know, why are you trying to impress  these people? You know, just be yourself.” And I think if we can just be  ourselves, be our authentic selves, we’re gonna be much more effective  as leaders.</p><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> Is it—an age thing that you sort of grow into this more enlightened view of business, as you see it?</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> Not necessarily. I —I find my young students in their 20s  are very enlightened. The question is did—their—their big challenge is  can I stay true to my True North? Can I—follow my course and not have to  compromise who I am?</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> You know, I had one student who’s been working for his company two  months after he graduated, and he said, “I’m ready to quit.” I said,  “Why?” “‘Cause they’re forcing me to move the numbers around. I won’t do  that.”</p><p> I said, “Stay with it. Do not bend. Because you’re doing the right thing.”</p><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> But that—it’s a great story that you’re telling,  because look at the pressure on this person. That you get within a large  organization, they’re telling you what they expect from you.</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> Right.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> And they’ll just—turf you out if you don’t obey.</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> Well, Maybe he should go somewhere else where his  qualities will be appreciated. At a certain point in time, I—I don’t  recommend bailing out —but maybe he should go to find a place where he’s  gonna be appreciated. Because there are a lot of organizations that  appreciate—appreciate that strength of character.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> I think people realize that if you deal ethically, you deal fairly,  you’ll win in the long run. And, yeah, if you want to play a short term  game, you can get caught up in that, you’re gonna lose it.</p><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> But so I’m clear. You think a person who has—lost his  or her sense—of what you would argue is True North, the right way, the  just way to go about practicing business, they can reorient? There’s  hope for that?</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> Absolutely. We have this great story of Kevin Sharer who  tells the story, when he left GE, flew out of there, he’s gonna be CEO  of MCI. It didn’t work out. He made a big mistake. And he recognized he  was being driven by his ego and his arrogance. He got in touch with  that, and he—he—he—then went to Amgen and he became a student, he became  a learner. He said, “I don’t know anything about biology, I’m gonna  learn it.” And these are the kind of CEOs that—I think are really  leading our companies today</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> But what case —does capitalism and, just say American  business, have to make to the public at large in order to—get to a  healthier place, as you see it?</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> That we are serving society through good jobs, ok.  Creating wealth for shareholders, for employees. And we’re creating  value for customers for the long term. We create quality products. We  create great value for our customers. We’re doing things in addition to  that that help society. You know, we’re funding Teach For America. Some  of the boards I’m —are on are helping out.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> Or Target. I was on their board for 12 years, gives away five percent of  its pre-tax profits. I think it was great. Because they’re helping  build educational systems.</p><p> We don’t have an educational system in this country, and where are we?  Where are we gonna get our employees in the future? You know, where are  we gonna get our customers? And so this becomes very critical that  companies see that they have a broader role in society.</p><p> In many ways you could argue the corporate model’s become the dominant  model in the world today. And so that puts a huge burden on us as  corporate leaders to take responsibility.</p><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> That’s the problem of a CEO? Trying to make the world a better place?</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> How do we serve society? We serve society by good jobs.  We serve society by creating wealth for people. We also mostly serve  society by creating great services and products for customers.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> You didn’t have shareholders saying, “Why are you  robbing us of our profits by practicing philanthropy? Give us the money,  we as the shareholders will give it away.”</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> Sure we did. Sure we did. But the philanthropy Medtronic  did has done a world of good. The philanthropy of Target—you know, when  Target was going through the tough times against Wal-Mart, they never  —Bob Ulrich never wavered once about that five percent<br>\n. Giving away five  percent of the profits.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><br><p> In fact, he saw this is the way to build our company. This can really  help us. We saw it the same way at Medtronic. We created educational  programs for the inner city schools.</p><p> Because we knew that’s where our employees are coming from. And so if we  don’t do that, if we aren’t in sync with society. And I think this new  generation of authentic leaders I’ve been talking about really sees that  they have to be in sync with society. They have to be in sync with the  environment. They have to be in sync with concerns about health  concerns. They have to be in sync and go with the flow, not go against  the flow.</p><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> Business with purpose—when they answer the purpose question, not just maximizing shareholder value next month.</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> Employees, the key is what motivates people. And they are  not gonna be motivated about maximizing shareholder value. I can tell  you that. You can make them all shareholders, and that will help. But  they’re—only gonna be motivated about a sense of purpose.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> Howard Schultz is trying to create a culture at Starbuck’s, you know,  where people are really excited about creating a wonderful environment  inside a Starbuck’s store for their customers. That’s what—if that’s  what the game is all about, that’s where the shareholder values—comes  from.</p><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> What’s at stake here? What if we don’t get it right in the way that you see it?</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> That’s the key question. Is capitalism gonna survive in a  form—it—if it goes off, like it did in the 90s, if we hadn’t had that  check, in fact, I think—and I wrote in my first book, Enron and—Arthur  Andersen did us a huge favor. ‘Cause they realized we’ve gone so far off  we had to restructure and we had to get back on track.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> But what’s at stake is whether our system can go forward, and have the  confidence and trust of the American people. And I think we need to  rebuild that trust.</p><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> Well, Bill George, thank you very much.</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>GEORGE:</strong> Good. Thank you David.</p><strong>GEORGE:</strong><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> Bill George was a card carrying CEO and now teaches at the Harvard Business School. His book is called “True North.”</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong><p> <strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong> And that’s it for NOW. From New York, I’m David Brancaccio</p><strong>BRANCACCIO:</strong>"

      "<p>Leadership in the 21st   Century<br> Westminster Town Hall   Forum<br> Minneapolis, Minnesota<br> March 15, 2007</p><br><br><br><p>It is a privilege to return to the Westminster Town Hall Forum to address the challenging subject of “Leadership in the 21st Century.”&nbsp; Four years ago I spoke here in the aftermath of the fall of Enron, World Com, and Tyco. My subject was “Crisis in Corporate Ethics: Where Have All the Leaders Gone?”&nbsp; My remarks that day were a precursor to my first book, <em>Authentic Leadership,</em> which challenged the new generation of   leaders to lead more authentically than the previous   generation.</p><em>Authentic Leadership,</em><p>Since that time, I have been teaching leadership and leadership development at Harvard Business School, and studying how to develop a new generation of authentic leaders to run our corporations, thus avoiding a repeat of these ethical lapses and destructive actions. The result is my new book, <em>True North: Discover Your Authentic   Leadership</em>, which is being launched nationwide today.</p><em>True North: Discover Your Authentic   Leadership</em><p>The Leadership Crisis in   America<br> America today faces a major crisis in leadership that spans the fields of politics, government, business, non-profits, education and religion. Confidence in our leaders, especially in business and politics, has fallen to an all-time low. Recent surveys by the Gallup poll show that only 22 percent of Americans trust our business leaders. That’s not just a problem – it represents the potential for disaster.</p><br><p>In part, the problem comes from a wrongheaded notion of what constitutes a leader, driven by an obsession with leaders at the top. In far too many cases we have selected the wrong people to lead and given them too much power – power they have often abused by violating the trust placed in them as leaders. As President Abraham Lincoln once said, “If you want to find out what a man is made of, give him unlimited power and watch how he uses it.”&nbsp; In many cases leaders have abused their power to serve themselves, instead of others.</p><p>Our entire system of capitalism, in which I believe so fervently, is based on trust – trust in the corporations and institutions that serve us and in their leaders. Through our legal system, society has granted corporations enormous freedom and power to make money for their owners while serving their constituencies and benefiting society as a whole. If we in the business community violate that trust, we risk losing those privileges and destroying the very system that has made the American economy the most vibrant and enduring in the history of the world.&nbsp; Witness the 2003 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, hastily passed by the U. S. Congress in thirty-one days in response to the crisis of confidence created by the fall of Enron and other companies. Violating the public trust risks the loss of capitalism’s freedoms.</p><p>For business leaders, trust is the vital fuel that makes our system function effectively. If our customers do not trust us, why would they buy our products?&nbsp; Physicians implanting life-saving Medtronic defibrillators in their patients have to trust Medtronic to ensure their quality. The same is true for every consumer who buys a new automobile, computer or television set. Employees trust their corporate leaders to build successful businesses that will provide good jobs, sound benefits like health care, and retirement plans. Investors trust corporate leaders to provide fair returns on their investments. And the public trusts corporations to act in the public interest. When leaders violate that trust, the lives and livelihood of their customers, employees, and investors at risk –&nbsp; and they risk the freedoms of our entire system of capitalism.</p><p>Learning from Authentic Leaders<br> My Harvard study of and how authentic leaders developed was undertaken with the support of my colleagues, Diana Mayer and Peter Sims, who is the co-author of True North. It is the largest in-depth study ever undertaken about how business leaders develop. The 125 leaders we interviewed provided us with deep insights into how they developed into authentic leaders and became successful. They were remarkably open and candid in sharing their life stories, personal struggles, failures, and triumphs.</p><br><p>These 125 leaders are a diverse group of women and men from a wide array of racial, religious, socioeconomic backgrounds and nationalities, and ranged in age from 23 to 93. Within the group, 28 percent are females, eight percent are racial minorities, and twelve percent are international citizens. Half are CEOs, and the other half includes an array of non-profit leaders, mid-career leaders, and young leaders just starting on their journeys.</p><p>In the past fifty years leadership scholars have conducted more than one thousand studies attempting to determine the definitive leadership styles, characteristics, or personality traits of successful leaders. None of these studies has produced a definitive profile of the ideal leader. Thank goodness. If scholars had produced a cookie-cutter leadership style, people would be forever trying to emulate it. That alone would make them into personas.</p><p>Kevin Sharer, who is currently chairman and CEO of Amgen, saw the downside of GE’s cult of personality in the 1980s while working as Jack Welch’s assistant. As he said, “Everyone wanted to be like Jack, but leadership has many voices. You need to be who you are, not try to emulate somebody else.”</p><p>The reality is   that <em>no one can be authentic by trying to be like someone else.</em> There is   no doubt that you can learn from the experiences of others, but there is no way   you can be successful trying to <em>be</em> like them. People trust you when you are genuine and authentic, not an imitation. As Dr. Reatha Clark King of General Mills told me, “If you’re aiming to be like somebody else, you’re just being a copy-cat because you think that’s what people want you to be&nbsp; You will never be a star with that kind of thinking. But you might be a star— unreplicatable—by following your passion.</p><em>no one can be authentic by trying to be like someone else.</em><em>be</em><p>After interviewing these 125   leaders, &nbsp;we believe we understand <em>why</em> previous studies have not been   successful: <em> Leaders are highly complex human beings, who have distinctive qualities that cannot be sufficiently described by lists of &nbsp;traits or characteristics.</em><br> <em> </em><br> Your Leadership   Emerges from Your Life Story<br> In reading the 3,000 pages of transcripts from these interviews, we were surprised that these leaders did not identify any characteristics, skills or styles that led to their success. Rather, they believed their leadership emerged from their life stories. By constantly testing themselves through real world experiences and by reframing their life stories to understand who they are, they unleashed their passions and discovered the purpose of their leadership.</p><em>why</em><em> Leaders are highly complex human beings, who have distinctive qualities that cannot be sufficiently described by lists of &nbsp;traits or characteristics.</em><br><em> </em><br><br><p>I vividly recall my interview with Dick Kovacevich, CEO of Wells Fargo, who has established the most successful track record of any commercial banker for the past twenty years. When I asked Dick what made him so successful, he surprised me with his answer. Instead of lauding the bank’s success, he spent twenty minutes telling what it was like growing up in a small sawmill town in western Washington, where no one had ever gone to college. Dick said he learned to lead not at Stanford Business School, where he graduated at the top of his class, but on his hometown athletic fields and at the corner grocery store where he worked from age eleven to eighteen. Every day Dick played sports for three hours, raced home to grab a sandwich, and then worked three hours in the grocery store. Sports taught Kovacevich that “a group of people can perform so much better as a team than as the sum of their individual talents.”</p><p>Kovacevich’s story is just one of hundreds we heard from our interviewees. The stories covered the full gamut of life’s experiences. One of the most powerful came from Starbucks’ founder Howard Schultz, whose father’s loss of his job and health care benefits from slipping on the ice led Schultz to create a company like Starbucks where his father would have been proud to work. For Schultz, Starbucks is about a creating a community of empowered employees and satisfied customers.</p><p>Andrea Jung, now CEO of Avon Products, was a rising star at Neiman-Marcus as executive VP in her early thirties. She decided she did not want to spend her life selling high-fashion designs to upper class women, so she resigned without another job. Joining Avon Products and later becoming CEO, she changed the mission of the company from selling cosmetics to the empowerment of women. Under her leadership Avon has gone from 1.5 million to 5.5 million people working for the company and achieving economic independence and success through their efforts. She and Schultz have remained true to their life stories to fulfill their personal missions and enhance the lives of tens of millions of people.</p><p>Most of the leaders we interviewed have been profoundly shaped by crucibles in their lives. These traumatic experiences enabled them to realize that leadership was <em>not</em> about their success or gratification, but rather about serving other people and empowering them to lead. In my experience – perhaps oversimplified – you can separate all leaders into two categories, those for whom leadership is about their success and those who are leading to serve others. The latter group finds inspiration in their life stories and the crucibles of their lives to make the transformation from “I” to “We.”&nbsp; The former group never makes that transition. Although many of them disguise their intentions with “we” language, their actions under pressure often reveal they are out for themselves.</p><em>not</em><p>One of the most moving crucible stories came from Novartis chairman and CEO Dan Vasella, whose early life traumas of spending a year in a sanatorium at age eight and the subsequent deaths of his sister and his father motivated him to become a compassionate physician who could lead a global healthcare company that could help millions of people every year. Oprah Winfrey talked openly about her experiences of being sexually abused, starting at nine years old. Reframing her experiences enabled her to become not just a television celebrity, but a caring leader whose mission is to help people take responsibility for their lives.</p><p>In my case it took a series of crucibles before I learned that my mission was not to become CEO of a global company, but to build an organization that could help other people through its life-saving products. In my teenage years, I was trying so hard to be a leader that I lost seven elections in a row. Thanks to a caring group in my college fraternity, I learned that my ambitions and selfish ways were blocking my ability to use my leadership gifts. Understanding that was the easy part; much more difficult was developing into a leader that truly cared about serving other people. In my mid-twenties the back-to-back deaths of my mother and my fiancée brought me to the depth of loneliness that caused me to explore deeply what life is all about. But it was not until I “hit the wall” in my career at Honeywell in my mid-forties that I finally recognized the deeper purpose of my leadership. It was not just to be CEO, but to join a unique company like Medtronic whose mission was to restore people to full life and health. Had it not been for the counsel and advice of my wife Penny, my close friend Doug Baker, my men’s group, and my couple’s group, I might never have come to that realization.</p><p>Over the past decade I have learned from Penny’s experience with breast cancer in 1996the power of a leader who leads from behind and inspires others to lead. Penny never saw herself as a leader, nor was she encouraged to become one by her parents. Through her healing from breast cancer, she discovered the power of integrative medicine. As a result, she has stepped up to lead because she is so determined to change the course of medicine to make it more humane and patient-centered, both locally and nationally.</p><p>New Leadership for   the 21st Century<br> All of these very human stories lead to the unmistakable conclusion that we need a new kind of leader to lead our institutions in the 21st century—a leader who can empower and inspire others to lead. The 20th century vision of a leader who commands the troops to follow him over the hill to build his glory is dead—or it should be!</p><br><p>Coming out of two world wars in the 1950s, we idolized all-powerful leaders like General George Patton, in spite of their evident flaws and abusive tendencies. We dichotomized leaders and workers, with the latter being mere cogs in the wheels of production. As a nineteen-year-old industrial engineering student in the 1960s, I used my stopwatch to study the motions of 55-year-old machine tool workers, without ever asking them how to make their work more effective and meaningful. That was the nature of the assembly line in those days. In the last two decades of the 20th century we developed a national obsession with the all-powerful charismatic leader at the top.</p><p>It is high time that we cast off these images of the all-powerful leaders who dominate their subordinates with power, intimidation, and a directive style. We do not need leaders who treat the people as a cost of doing business rather than the basis for the business’ success. No longer can we tolerate leaders who increase earnings by eliminating what has made the organization successful, while they personally reap millions in compensation. Employees, customers, investors, and the public at large have every reason <em>not</em> to trust these vestiges of failed   20th century leadership.</p><em>not</em><p>Leadership in this new century <em>must</em> change precisely because the nature of people in organizations has changed. People today are more knowledgeable about their jobs than their bosses are. They are demanding meaning and significance from their work, and are not willing to toil away just for someone else’s benefit. They want to lead now, not wait in line for ten to twenty years until they are tapped for a leadership role.</p><em>must</em><p>Why shouldn’t they expect and demand this level of   respect and meaning?&nbsp; Why shouldn’t you?</p><table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>You can discover your authentic leadership   right now.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>You do not have to be born with the   characteristics or traits of a leader.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>You do not have to wait for a tap on the   shoulder.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>You can step up to lead at any point in   your life.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>You are never too young – or too old.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>As Stephen Covey has said, “Leadership is   your choice, <em>not</em> your title.”</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>You can discover your authentic leadership   right now.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>You do not have to be born with the   characteristics or traits of a leader.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>You do not have to wait for a tap on the   shoulder.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>You can step up to lead at any point in   your life.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>You are never too young – or too old.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>As Stephen Covey has said, “Leadership is   your choice, <em>not</em> your title.”</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody><tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>You can discover your authentic leadership   right now.</td>\n</tr><td>•</td><td>You can discover your authentic leadership   right now.</td><tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>You do not have to be born with the   characteristics or traits of a leader.</td>\n</tr><td>•</td><td>You do not have to be born with the   characteristics or traits of a leader.</td><tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>You do not have to wait for a tap on the   shoulder.</td>\n</tr><td>•</td><td>You do not have to wait for a tap on the   shoulder.</td><tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>You can step up to lead at any point in   your life.</td>\n</tr><td>•</td><td>You can step up to lead at any point in   your life.</td><tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>You are never too young – or too old.</td>\n</tr><td>•</td><td>You are never too young – or too old.</td><tr>\n<td>•</td>\n<td>As Stephen Covey has said, “Leadership is   your choice, <em>not</em> your title.”</td>\n</tr><td>•</td><td>As Stephen Covey has said, “Leadership is   your choice, <em>not</em> your title.”</td><em>not</em><p>I would like to offer a new definition of   successful 21st century leaders. They are: <em>authentic leaders who bring people together around a shared mission and values and empower them to lead, in order to serve their customers while creating value for all their stakeholders. </em></p><em>authentic leaders who bring people together around a shared mission and values and empower them to lead, in order to serve their customers while creating value for all their stakeholders. </em><p>From reading the press these days, one gets the impression that most leaders are greedy people out to feather their own nests. For all the negative publicity they generate, I am pleased to say such leaders these days are the exception, <em>not</em> the rule. There is a new generation of authentic leaders stepping up to lead our organizations. Locally, we are blessed with outstanding leaders like Marilyn Nelson of Carlson, Brad Anderson of Best Buy, Bob Ulrich of Target, Doug Baker, Jr. of Ecolab, Steve Rothschild at Twin Cities Rise! and my successor at Medtronic, Art Collins.</p><em>not</em><p>Nationally as well, a new generation of leaders is leading our corporations in an entirely different manner than their predecessors. These leaders recognize the value of bringing people together around a shared mission and values and empowering leaders at all levels. Standouts among the group of leaders who have stepped into top roles since the fall of Enron, include Jeff Immelt of GE, Anne Mulcahy of Xerox, A. G. Lafley of Procter &amp; Gamble, Sam Palmisano of IBM, and Andrea Jung of Avon, as well as non-profit leaders like Wendy Kopp of Teach For America and Nancy Barry of Women’s World Bank. These leaders of major organizations are setting the new standard, enabling their people, young and old alike, to take on important leadership roles.</p><p>Let me make this prediction: successful organizations in the 21st century will be those that get the best out of people by motivating them with an inspiring mission and empower people at all levels of the organization. This is why for-profit organizations like Target, P&amp;G, Best Buy, J&amp;J, and Wells Fargo are able to sustain their success, year after year. On the other side, lack of inspired leadership is the reason why organizations like General Motors, Sears, Home Depot, and Ford are struggling.</p><p>True North: Discovering Your Authentic   Leadership</p><p>I wrote <em>True   North</em> to answer the question, “How do you become an authentic leader?”&nbsp; The answer is that it takes years of hard work and development. The key is knowing the True North of your internal compass, and preparing yourself to stay on course in spite of the challenges and seductions that cause so many leaders to go astray.</p><em>True   North</em><p>Your True North represents who you are as a human being at your deepest level – your fixed point in a spinning world that helps you stay on track as a leader. True North is based on your most cherished values, passions, and motivations. When you follow your True North, your leadership will be authentic, and people will naturally want to associate with you.</p><p>Discovering your True North takes a lifetime of commitment and learning. Each day, as you are tested in the real world, you yearn to look in the mirror and respect the person you see and the life you lead. As long as you are true to who you are, you can cope with the most difficult circumstances that life presents.</p><p>In reality, other people may have very different expectations for your leadership than you have for yourself. You will be pressured by external forces to respond to their needs and seduced by rewards for fulfilling them – pressures and seductions that may cause you to detour from your True North. When you get too far off course, your internal compass tells you something is wrong and you need to reorient yourself. It requires strength of character, courage, and resolve to resist these pressures and take corrective action when necessary.</p><p>As Sara Lee CEO Brenda Barnes told us, “The most important thing about leadership is your character and the values that guide your life. Everything in business isn’t black and white; there are a lot of gray areas. But if you let your values guide your actions and don’t ever lose your internal compass, you’re going to be fine.”</p><p>When you are aligned with True North, there is coherence between your life story and your leadership. As psychologist William James wrote a century ago, “The best way to define a person’s character is to seek out the time when he felt most deeply and intensely alive; when he could hear his inner voice saying, ‘This is the real me.’”</p><p>Can you recall a time when you felt most intensely alive and could say, “This is the real me”?&nbsp; When you can, you are aligned with True North and prepared to lead others authentically. In my own case I had just that feeling the first time I walked into Medtronic in 1989 and felt I could be myself and be appreciated for who I was.</p><p>Developing as an Authentic   Leader<br> Becoming an authentic leader is a long journey that takes hard work on your part, just as it does to become a virtuoso violin player or a champion athlete. As GE’s Jeff Immelt told us, “Leadership is one of those great journeys into your soul. It’s not like anyone can tell you how to do it.”</p><br><p>In studying leaders who have failed, I realized that their failure resulted from their inability to lead themselves. As we discerned from our interviews, <em>the hardest person you will ever have to lead is yourself.</em> When you can lead yourself through the challenges and difficulties, you will find that leading others becomes relatively straight-forward.</p><em>the hardest person you will ever have to lead is yourself.</em><p>We learned that   there are six principal areas required to lead yourself:</p><table border=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Gaining self-awareness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Practicing your values and principles under   pressure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Balancing your extrinsic and intrinsic   motivations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Building your support team</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Staying grounded by integrating your life</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Understanding your passions and purpose of   your leadership</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table><tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Gaining self-awareness</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Practicing your values and principles under   pressure</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Balancing your extrinsic and intrinsic   motivations</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Building your support team</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Staying grounded by integrating your life</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Understanding your passions and purpose of   your leadership</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody><tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>Gaining self-awareness</td>\n</tr><td>1</td><td>Gaining self-awareness</td><tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Practicing your values and principles under   pressure</td>\n</tr><td>2</td><td>Practicing your values and principles under   pressure</td><tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Balancing your extrinsic and intrinsic   motivations</td>\n</tr><td>3</td><td>Balancing your extrinsic and intrinsic   motivations</td><tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>Building your support team</td>\n</tr><td>4</td><td>Building your support team</td><tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>Staying grounded by integrating your life</td>\n</tr><td>5</td><td>Staying grounded by integrating your life</td><tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Understanding your passions and purpose of   your leadership</td>\n</tr><td>6</td><td>Understanding your passions and purpose of   your leadership</td><p>Self-Awareness: <br> It may take a lifetime to gain complete awareness of yourself, but your self-knowledge can be accelerated by honest feedback from others.</p><br><p>In his mid-thirties Doug Baker, Jr. was a rising star at Ecolab who had taken over the company’s newly acquired subsidiary in North Carolina. Through his early success, Baker told me he had become arrogant and self-centered. Then he got some tough feedback from his subordinates who told him all of this and more. Baker calls getting the unexpected criticism “a cathartic experience.”&nbsp; He explained, “It was as if someone flashed a mirror in front of me at my absolute worst. What I saw was horrifying, but it was also a great lesson. After that, I did a lot of soul-searching about what kind of leader I was going to be, talked to my Ecolab team about what I had learned, and asked for their help.”&nbsp; Baker’s self-awareness is a critical factor in his success in becoming CEO of Ecolab nine years later.</p><p>Practicing   Your Values:<br> The key to your   values is <em>not</em> what you say you believe, or even how you behave when things are going well. You find out what your values really are when you are under pressure or things are not going your way.</p><br><em>not</em><p>Today Jon Huntsman is the successful founder of Huntsman Chemical, leader of a 73-person family, and a bishop in his Mormon church. In 1973 he was a young staffer working for President Nixon’s notoriously powerful chief of staff, Bob Haldeman. One day Haldeman directed him to carry out an undercover sting operation involving illegal immigrants that was designed to embarrass a Congressman opposing Nixon’s initiatives. At first, Huntsman went along with the game, calling the plant manager to give him instructions. He recalled, “There are times when we react too quickly and fail to realize immediately what is right and wrong. This was one of those times when I didn’t think it through. After fifteen minutes, my inner moral compass kicked in and I told the plant manager, ‘Forget that I called. I don’t want to play this game.’”&nbsp; Huntsman recognized that rejecting the orders of the second most powerful person in the country would be viewed as disloyal and his White House career was over. “So be it,” he said, “I quit in the next six months.”</p><p>Balancing Your   Motivations:<br> Not surprisingly, leaders like promotions, pay increases, and recognition from their peers and the media. But if these motivations dominate their passions, they are at risk of derailing, sooner or later. Authentic leaders recognize their intrinsic motivations like helping others, making a difference in the world, and building organizations with purpose and meaning.&nbsp; The important thing is not to deny your extrinsic motivations, but to balance them with intrinsic motivations.</p><br><p>Kevin Sharer was a rising star at General Electric at age 41 and on Jack Welch’s “high potential list.”&nbsp; When a search firm proposed that Kevin join MCI for a faster route to the top, he jumped at the opportunity, leaving Welch unhappy with his sudden departure. Once at MCI, Kevin learned quickly that the COO was in line for the top slot and didn’t welcome the new hotshot from GE. His “know-it-all” attitude didn’t help either, especially when he proposed reorganizing the company. Sharer’s crucible at MCI proved invaluable to him: caught up in the glamour of being a rising star, he was brought down to reality and forced to recognize what really motivated him. When the opportunity arose to become COO of Amgen, a chastened Sharer recognized the importance of Amgen’s work in saving lives. He earnestly studied biology and the biotech business for seven years before becoming CEO. By then, he was able to balance his extrinsic motivations with the intrinsic satisfactions that Amgen’s mission provided him.</p><p>Building Your Support Team<br> An essential element of staying focused on your True North is to build a support team to help you stay on track. Your team starts with having at least one person in your life with whom you can be completely open and honest. It could be your spouse, best friend, mentor, or therapist. In my case, that person is my wife Penny, who is largely responsible for whatever success I have enjoyed. She keeps me on track, especially when I get caught up in selfish desires. Your family, friends, and mentor also help you stay grounded, especially when you most need their help.</p><br><p>I also believe in having a support group of peers with whom you can share openly and who will be there for you when you need them. I have been blessed with having a men’s group with whom I have been meeting every Wednesday morning for the last thirty years, as well as a couples group that Penny and I helped form twenty years ago. These two groups of people, most of whom are here today, have been there for me when I most needed their support. When Penny was diagnosed with breast cancer eleven years ago, they were there to support both of us through the difficult times that followed.</p><p>But you cannot wait to build your support team until you are facing difficulty. The time to do it is now, because long-term, deep relationships and shared life histories take decades to build.</p><p>Staying Grounded by   Integrating Your Life<br> Every leader I know is facing the challenges of meeting all their commitments in life – their jobs, their families and their communities as well as preserving time for their personal life. I can assure you, this isn’t getting any easier, as the work week increases and the demands of families and communities are rising. How do you stay grounded with all the pressures coming at you?&nbsp; The key is maintaining your integrity by being the same person in all these environments, and not letting work commitments pull you away from the fullness of life. This isn’t easy, but it can be done by making choices and setting boundaries, and <em>not</em> selling your soul to your job. If you don’t do these things, you may become a shooting star who burns out before you have the opportunity to fulfill your dreams.</p><br><em>not</em><p>Your Passions   Reveal the Purpose of Your Leadership<br> Finally, when you understand the passions that emanate from your life story, you will discover the purpose of your leadership – in other words, your True North will become clear. Let’s look at how Ellen Breyer, CEO of Hazelden, the nation’s leading chemical dependency organization, discovered her purpose. In her 1960s college years, Breyer was a student activist, protesting the Vietnam War, joining civil-rights marches, and leading voter registration drives. Although she never violated the law, the Nixon administration viewed her as subversive and rescinded her student loans.</p><br><p>For the next thirty years Breyer worked in the corporate world and focused on her family as she followed her husband’s career. When her youngest son left for college, she took a sabbatical in Aspen, where she realized she was most interested in her non-profit activities. When the top position at Hazelden opened, Breyer stepped up from the board to become CEO. Here she has rekindled the passions of her youth: working for a cause she believes in as she helps thousands of people recover from addictions.</p><p>Empowering People   to Lead<br> Developing yourself to gain self-awareness, solidify your values, balance your motivations, build your support team, integrate your life, and understand your purpose is not an easy task. But as you do so, you will find that leading others is relatively straight-forward. By leading authentically, you can unite people around a common purpose and empower them to step up and lead. That’s what the best 21st century leaders are doing, and the reason why their organizations over the long-term far outperform organizations still operating in the 20th century mold.</p><br><p>An example of such an empowering 21st C. leader is Marilyn Nelson, CEO of the Carlson Companies. When she took over leadership, she recognized Carlson’s culture had to change dramatically if it was going to succeed in the future. She decided to reinvent Carlson as a company that cared for customers by creating a caring environment for its employees. To build the new culture, Nelson went on a personal crusade to bring her message of empowerment to Carlson employees around the world. In her personal interactions she carried with her the memories of her daughter’s tragic death in an automobile accident years before as she vowed to “give back and make life better for people.”</p><p>Your Call to   Experience the Fulfillment of True North Leadership<br> When we examine organizations that are led by authentic leaders, we recognize there is no shortage of leaders. In every organization there are many, many leaders just waiting for opportunities to lead. My advice to you is, don’t wait to be asked. You can step up and lead right now, and your organization will be better off because you did. In thinking about whether to take on leadership challenges, ask yourself these two simple questions,</p><br><p><em>If not me, then   who?&nbsp; If not now, then when?</em></p><em>If not me, then   who?&nbsp; If not now, then when?</em><p>You <em>are</em> capable of leading, and the experience is worth any risks you may take or criticism you may endure. As President Theodore Roosevelt said,</p><em>are</em><p><em>It is not the critic who counts. The credit belongs to the person in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows the triumph of high achievement and who if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</em></p><em>It is not the critic who counts. The credit belongs to the person in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows the triumph of high achievement and who if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</em><p>Are you prepared to enter that arena, to dare greatly, and to spend yourself in a worthy cause? &nbsp;If you are, you will know the triumph of high achievement and you will experience the fulfillment of leadership.</p><p>You will know the joy of working with a passionate group of people toward shared goals, of confronting challenges and overcoming barriers, and of leaving a legacy to the world through your leadership. There is nothing that can compare to this sense of fulfillment.</p><p>You will have the satisfaction of knowing that you followed your True North, you discovered your authentic leadership, and the world is a better place because of you. <em>You will have become a True North   leader. </em></p><em>You will have become a True North   leader. </em>"

      "<p>Leadership in the 21st   Century<br> Address by Bill   George<br> The Economics Club of   Grand Rapids November 7, 2006</p><br><br><p>Leadership in the United States is in a disturbing state – in politics, government, business, education, religion and non-profits.&nbsp; From Congress to the United Health Group, the National Association of Evangelicals, and the American Red Cross, many of our leaders seem to be ethically challenged, to use a polite euphemism.</p><p>The Root Causes of the   Leadership Crisis<br> The roots of the current leadership crisis go much deeper than a few ethical deviants.&nbsp; This may surprise you, but I am far less concerned with Jeff Skilling, Bernie Ebbers, Jack Abramoff, or Bob Ney because our legal system has proven to be quite effective and equitable in dealing with them.&nbsp; My far greater concern lies with the way we are choosing our leaders, setting them up as heroes, and then stomping on them as they fall.</p><br><p>We have a national obsession with leaders at the top of organizations, from the President to CEOs.&nbsp; Unfortunately, our wrongheaded notion of what constitutes a leader often results in the wrong people attaining critical leadership roles.&nbsp; Boards of directors, search committees, and voters often select leaders for:</p><ul>\n<li>Their charisma instead of   their character;</li>\n<li>Their image instead of their   integrity;</li>\n<li>Their style instead of their   substance</li>\n</ul><li>Their charisma instead of   their character;</li><li>Their image instead of their   integrity;</li><li>Their style instead of their   substance</li><p>If they are chosen for charisma, image and style, why are we surprised when our leaders lack character, integrity, and substance?</p><p>The root cause of the leadership crisis is our fundamental misunderstanding of leadership.&nbsp; We are mired in a 20th century view of leadership that emerged from two world wars that gave us the image of the great leader leading his troops up the hill to plant the flag.&nbsp; Or the manufacturing model of General Motors’ Alfred P. Sloan, where thousands of workers, timed by the stopwatches of efficiency experts, do their small part to make the assembly line run efficiently.&nbsp; Or, more recently, the charismatic, all-powerful leaders of the 1990s in the image of GE’s Jack Welch, who dominated the business world with basic models like Six Sigma and 20/70/10 vitality curves.&nbsp; If only our lives these days were that simple!</p><p>Instead, we face snipers in Baghdad, and a wide array of constituencies in business, from hedge funds to short sellers,, disgruntled customers, and aggrieved employees suing us, to whistle blowers, NGOs, and federal regulators, all with individual demands that bear little relationship to the fundamentals of our business, but which can distract us and pull us down.</p><p>Redefining   21st C. Leadership<br> Amidst all this complexity, the time is ripe to redefine leadership for the 21st century around the needs and desires of people today.&nbsp; The military-manufacturing model of leadership that worked so well fifty years ago does not get the best out of people today.&nbsp; People are simply too will informed and educated to be led by a set of rules or to blindly follow their leader over the hill.&nbsp; In the 21st century we have well-educated knowledge workers who want to follow their own drumbeats, but not give themselves over to someone they do not trust.</p><br><p>The good news today is that there is no shortage of people with the capacity to lead.&nbsp; There are many, many leaders throughout organizations – and many outside organizations – just waiting for the opportunity to step up and lead.&nbsp; In too many organizations, however, people do not feel empowered to take charge, nor are they rewarded for doing so.</p><p>Leadership is not just being in charge of a large organization: it is stepping up to the leadership challenges in the environment around you.&nbsp; Does this mean anyone can lead?&nbsp; In a real sense, yes, anyone who has the passion to lead and the commitment to develop as a leader can become an effective leader.&nbsp; As Ann Fudge, CEO of Young &amp; Rubicam says, “All of us have the spark of leadership in us, whether in business, government, or as a non-profit volunteer.&nbsp; The challenge is to understand ourselves well enough to discover w2here we can use our leadership gifts to serve others.&nbsp; We’re here for something.&nbsp; Life is about giving and living fully.”</p><p>What 21st   Century Leadership Is All About<br> The best 21st century leaders are authentic people who are uniquely themselves – the genuine article, if you will.&nbsp; They have the capacity to bring people together around a common mission or purpose and a shared set of values and empower them to step up and lead, each in their own authentic way.</p><br><p>The bottom line is this:</p><ul>\n<li>You can discover your   authentic leadership right now.</li>\n<li>You do not have to be born   with specific characteristics or traits of a lead</li>\n<li>You do not have to be on top   of an organization.</li>\n<li>You do not have to wait to   be tapped on the shoulder.</li>\n<li>You can step and lead at any   point in your life.</li>\n</ul><li>You can discover your   authentic leadership right now.</li><li>You do not have to be born   with specific characteristics or traits of a lead</li><li>You do not have to be on top   of an organization.</li><li>You do not have to wait to   be tapped on the shoulder.</li><li>You can step and lead at any   point in your life.</li><p>Why not right now?&nbsp; Is anything holding you back?&nbsp; In considering whether to step up and lead authentically, ask yourself these two questions:</p><p>If not me, then who?&nbsp; If not   now, then when?</p><p>I wrote <em>Authentic   Leadership</em> in 2003 as a clarion call to the new generation of leaders to   lead authentically:</p><em>Authentic   Leadership</em><ul>\n<li>With a passion for their   purpose,</li>\n<li>By practicing their values   every day, especially when under pressure,</li>\n<li>To lead with their hearts,   with compassion, empathy and courage,</li>\n<li>By establishing connected   relationships with people,</li>\n<li>And by having the   self-discipline to get results.</li>\n</ul><li>With a passion for their   purpose,</li><li>By practicing their values   every day, especially when under pressure,</li><li>To lead with their hearts,   with compassion, empathy and courage,</li><li>By establishing connected   relationships with people,</li><li>And by having the   self-discipline to get results.</li><p>There is good news in   leadership happening right in front of our eyes.&nbsp; Since the fall</p><p>Enron, a generation of leaders is stepping up to lead our major corporations, people like Jeff Immelt of GE, Sam Palmisano of IBM, Andrea Jung of Avon Products, and Anne Mulcahy of Xerox.&nbsp; They are transforming their organizations to inspire people throughout their organizations to lead authentically, and producing sustainable long-term results because of the cultures they are creating.</p><p>Discovering Your   Authentic Leadership<br> After <em>Authentic Leadership</em> was published, many people asked me the question: How do I become and remain an authentic leader?&nbsp; With the efforts of two colleagues, Peter Sims and Diana Mayer, we interviewed 125 authentic leaders about they developed as leaders.&nbsp; From them we learned that the essential difference in their leadership was <em>not</em> their characteristics, traits, and styles.&nbsp; Rather it was in the inspiration that they gleaned from their life stories and how framing their stories, including their crucibles and transformative experiences, gave them the passion to make a difference in the world by leading and impacting other people.&nbsp; We also learned that the hardest person you will ever have to lead is yourself, and that failure to lead oneself was the cause of so many leaders in recent years losing their way and being derailed in their careers.&nbsp; From the 3,000 pages of transcripts from these interviews, we boiled the process of discovering your authentic leadership down to these five basic points:</p><br><em>Authentic Leadership</em><em>not</em><p>Having self-awareness and an   understanding of your True North;</p><p>Understanding your values,   leadership principles, and ethical boundaries.</p><p>Balancing your extrinsic   motivations with your intrinsic motivations.</p><p>Building a support team that   can help you stay on track.</p><p>Living an integrated   life.</p><p>By working on these five areas of development, leaders grew to understand the purpose of their leadership and developed the capacity to inspire others to lead around a common purpose and set of values, as they continued to hone their leadership styles and their ability to use their power most effectively.</p><p>If we can build organizations of empowered leaders, we can resolve our leadership vacuum and create lasting institutions that sustain their success and fulfillment for all of the participants.</p><p>The Fulfillment of   Leadership<br> In approaching whether and how you want to step up to lead, think ahead to the end of your life.&nbsp;&nbsp; Your whole family is gathered around your bedside when your granddaughter looks up at you and says, “Tell me what you did to make a difference in the world.”&nbsp; What are you going to tell her?&nbsp; If you can honestly say that you made a difference by bringing people together around a common purpose as you empowered them to lead, then you will have known just how fulfilling leadership can be.&nbsp; No experience can be as thrilling as working hard to accomplish a bold goal with a group of people, facing great challenges as you do, and then realizing your greatest dreams together.</p><br><p>That is the fulfillment of leadership.</p>"

      "<p>Truly Authentic Leadership<br>\n<em>U.S. News &amp; World Report </em><br>\n10/30/2006</p><br><em>U.S. News &amp; World Report </em><br><p>By Bill George</p><p>If ever there was a time when America needs leaders, it’s now. The litany of problems is all too familiar— Iraq , healthcare, schools, energy, the seemingly endless series of corporate scandals. What’s nowhere to be found, however—or almost nowhere—is the leadership needed to fix things. The problem isn’t the lack of potential leaders, however, but a wrongheaded notion of what exactly a leader is. This misguided notion of leadership often results in the wrong people attaining critical leadership roles. Search committees and voters alike fall into the trap of choosing leaders for their style rather than their substance, for their image instead of their integrity. Given this way of doing business, why should we be surprised when our leaders come up short?</p><p>The only valid test of a leader is his or her ability to bring people together to achieve sustainable results over time. There’s no such thing as the “One-Minute Leader” because real leadership requires years of development and hard work.</p><p>The good news is that there is no shortage of people with the capacity to lead. There are leaders throughout organizations just waiting for the opportunity. In too many organizations, however, people don’t feel empowered to take charge, nor are they rewarded for doing so. Young &amp; Rubicam Brand’s CEO, Ann Fudge, says, “All of us have the spark of leadership in us, whether it is in business, in government, or as a nonprofit volunteer. The challenge is to understand ourselves well enough to discover where we can use our leadership gifts to serve others.”</p><p>How do we recognize authentic leaders? Usually, they demonstrate these five traits:</p><ol>\n<li>Pursuing their purpose with passion</li>\n<li>Practicing solid values</li>\n<li>Leading with their hearts as well as their heads</li>\n<li>Establishing connected relationships</li>\n<li>Demonstrating self-discipline</li>\n</ol><li>Pursuing their purpose with passion</li><li>Practicing solid values</li><li>Leading with their hearts as well as their heads</li><li>Establishing connected relationships</li><li>Demonstrating self-discipline</li><p>To be effective leaders of people, authentic leaders must first discover the purpose of their leadership. If they don’t, they are at the mercy of their egos and narcissistic impulses. To discover their purpose, authentic leaders have to understand themselves and the passions that animate their life stories.</p><p>When Wendy Kopp was a senior at Princeton, she was saddened by the inequities in public education. It wasn’t fair, she thought, that so many kids were deprived of a sound education. At a national conference she organized on education reform, an idea suddenly came to her: “Why doesn’t America have a national teacher corps of recent college graduates who commit two years to teach in public schools?” Her question inspired her to found Teach For America, the most successful secondary educational program of the past 25 years.</p><p>After working a hundred hours a week for five years to build Teach For America, Kopp faced a crisis: declining applications for teaching positions, reductions in funding, and a blistering critique of her efforts in the educational journal <em>Phi Beta Kappa</em>. Stung, Kopp considered resigning or even shutting down her organization. Then she refocused on her purpose and redoubled her efforts. A decade later, Teach For America has grown 10-fold, to 4,400 teachers a year.</p><em>Phi Beta Kappa</em><p>The values of authentic leaders are shaped by their personal beliefs and developed through introspection, consultation with others, and years of nxperience. The test of authentic leaders’ values is not what they say but how they act under pressure. If leaders aren’t true to the values they profess, the trust is broken and not easily regained.</p><p>Authentic leaders also know that competing successfully takes a consistently high level of self-discipline. It would be hard to find someone who illustrates the positive effects of self-discipline better than Warren Buffett. For over 40 years, he has followed a basic set of principles that have made him the most successful investor in America. By avoiding debt and high-risk investments and concentrating on value companies and long-term positions, Buffett has been an absolute model of self-discipline-also reflected in his personal life. Buffett lives in the house he bought in 1956 for $31,500, drives an old car, and washes his meals down with a Cherry Coke at Gorat’s, his favorite Omaha steakhouse.</p><p>The challenges of leadership are so great these days that many ask whether it’s worth taking on a leadership role. This issue of “America’s Best Leaders” tells the stories of people who said yes. They are, as Teddy Roosevelt said, “in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood … who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions … knows in the end the triumph of high achievement” that can come only by “daring greatly.”</p><p>No individual achievement can equal the pleasure of leading a group of people to achieve a worthy goal. When you cross the finish line together, there’s a deep satisfaction that it was your leadership that made the difference. There’s simply nothing that can compare with that.</p><p><em>Bill George, the former chair and CEO of Medtronic, is a professor at Harvard Business School and a member of the Best Leaders selection committee.

      "<p>America Needs a Health Care   System,<br> Not a Sick Care System</p><br><p>The headlines with bad news for Americans about our health care system never seem to abate: “Health care costs hit record high.” “Health outcomes decline again.” “A record 45 million Americans lack health insurance.” A recent study published in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine found that only 55 percent of U.S. patients receive proper medical care.</p><p>Yet in America we are blessed with the finest health professions and a myriad of private and government-funded health plans. What explains this seeming paradox? While the individual elements of our health care system are excellent, the system itself is badly broken. The reality is that we do not have a <em>health care </em>system that encourages people to   be healthy. We have a <em>sick care </em>system with no rewards for helping   patients prevent disease and few consequences for people who abuse their health.</p><em>health care </em><em>sick care </em><p>Our system reminds us of the story of the five blind men and the elephant. Each of the five touched a different part of the elephant’s anatomy and described an entirely different being, but no one realized it was an elephant. The same is true with our health care system: no one is looking at root causes of the system’s problems. Instead, we are tinkering around the edges rather than addressing the underlying assumptions in order to transform the system from sick care into genuine health care.</p><p>What are the root causes of the problem?   Let’s consider these realities:</p><p>1. Our system focuses on disease, not on wellness. Less than two per cent of our health care dollars go into maintaining health and preventing disease.</p><p>2. We focus on curing, instead of healing, even though 75% of our dollars are spent on chronic diseases for which there are no cures.</p><p>3. Financial incentives are for tests and   procedures, not health outcomes.</p><p>4. We do not treat the whole person, failing   to harness the healing powers of the body, mind and spirit.</p><p>5. We intervene late in the course of disease progression, when illness is less reversible and the cost of treating it is far greater.</p><p>6. Productivity standards such as reducing physician time per patient visit discourage physicians, nurses and hospitals from taking the time to get beneath surface symptoms to the deeper causes of patients’ problems. Physicians today average only seven minutes per patient.</p><p>7. Patients are encouraged to be passive recipients of their health professionals’ ministrations, as the medical system does not emphasize patient empowerment and partnering. Yet lifestyle behavioral choices influence the trajectory of chronic illnesses.</p><p>A new approach is required, one that focuses on the whole person and empowers people to take responsibility for their health. Called integrative medicine, this approach focuses on wellness and preventing illness while integrating the best elements of conventional medicine with complementary therapies drawn from other healing traditions. Integrative medicine is patient-centered, emphasizing partnership and collaboration between patients and health professionals and offering genuine choices in healing.</p><p>Rather than looking at the patient as a diseased body part, integrative medicine sees a whole person, connected in body, mind and spirit with immense powers of self-healing. It believes that all aspects of patients’ lives need to be addressed in order to become and stay well. It emphasizes new models for treating chronic illness, recognizing that episodic care is an expensive and ineffective revolving door.</p><p>Concurrent with this shift in focus, we need fundamental changes in the way health care is reimbursed. There is essentially no reimbursement for maintaining health and preventing disease, and few limits on payments for treating disease. In most instances co-pays are so small that they have little or no influence on health behaviors of individuals. This must change, or we will continue on an ever-upward spiral of cost escalation until as a nation we simply cannot afford quality health care.</p><p>What is the cost impact of integrative medicine? We believe integrative medicine will deliver more effective medicine at a lower cost than current care. By preventing or delaying the onset of chronic diseases, the cost of treating chronic disease will decline. By doing what they can for themselves, people with chronic conditions will be better equipped to avoid recurrences.</p><p>To bring about these changes in behavior, Medicare and the nation’s leading insurers should work together with leaders in integrative medicine to pilot innovative reimbursement programs to address chronic conditions holistically. For example, chronic pain, diabetes and heart disease are three conditions that offer immediate opportunities to use integrative approaches to demonstrate improved patient outcomes and cost reductions.</p><p>Minnesota is leading the nation in the development of integrative medicine, just as it did with health maintenance plans thirty years ago and innovative medical procedures such as open heart surgery, multi-organ transplants, and spinal surgery. For the past decade the University of Minnesota, Abbott-Northwestern Hospital, Mayo Clinic, the Marsh, and United Health Group have been pioneering new ways of treating the whole person.</p><p>The University has been a national leader in training health professionals for integrative medicine. Through its Institute for Health and Healing, Abbott Northwestern Hospital is delivering nearly one thousand in-patient integrative treatments per month to seriously ill patients. While Mayo is researching the effectiveness of integrative therapies, the Marsh is a national model for integrative wellness centers. United Health Group is pioneering reimbursing therapies such as acupuncture and chiropractic care as they are shown to be effective.</p><p>To increase the awareness of the general public of how medicine is changing, Twin Cities Public Television (TPT) has produced a two-hour nationwide special called “The New Medicine” that describes integrative medicine and shows how the principles behind it are changing our nation’s leading medical institutions. It will air this Wednesday, March 29, from 7-9pm , followed by a panel featuring local experts examining “The New Medicine in Minnesota .” TPT’s website for the program is www.thenewmedicine.org.</p><p>We are nearing the tipping point when the evidence of the benefits of integrative medicine will become so clear that “the new medicine” will be recognized as the best – and only sustainable – approach to addressing the root causes of the health care crisis. By adopting this new medicine, we have the opportunity to heal the healthcare system itself.</p>"

      "<p>Becoming an Authentic Leader<br> Bryant   University Commencement Address<br> Smithfield, RI – May 21, 2005</p><br><br><p>To the Bryant University Graduates, Faculty, Administration, and Family   Members:</p><p>I am deeply honored to be here today, to receive the honorary doctor’s degree from Bryant University, and to have the privilege of delivering this commencement address to you.&nbsp; I am most grateful to your president, Ronald Machtley, and the chair of the board of trustees, John Callahan, for offering me this opportunity.</p><p>As new graduates of the Bryant University class of 2005, you are entering a world that is both exciting and at times rather frightening.&nbsp; Never before in our history have young people such as yourselves had such a myriad of exciting opportunities to go into the worlds of business, law, medicine, education, and public service and make such a difference at a young age.&nbsp; You can have an impact on a giant corporation or start your own business at a very young age, and achieve great success and financial remuneration.&nbsp; Or if it doesn’t work out, you can change companies or start a new one.&nbsp; One failure does not end your career – in fact, it may enhance it, if you learn from the experience.&nbsp; Yet at times the sea of choices must seem overwhelming to you, just as it does to my MBAs in their late twenties at Harvard.</p><p>Yet the world of the early 21st century can also be a frightening one.&nbsp; Not long after you arrived as freshmen on this campus the horrific events of September 11, 2001 occurred just miles away in New York City, a date that will live in infamy for every American.&nbsp; Suddenly, our long-held belief that we were safe within the borders of the United States was shattered, and our physical security was threatened.&nbsp; No longer were massive attacks something that occurred only in distant countries most of us had never visited.</p><p>I suspect that each one of you can recall exactly where you were when you first heard about the airplane that had flown into the World Trade Center.&nbsp; That is an image seared in your mind that you will remember for the rest of your life, just as the time when I came out of a computer lab at Georgia Tech in my senior year of college to learn that President John F. Kennedy had been assassinated in Dallas – a memory that is as vivid to me today as it was on November 22, 1963.&nbsp; And for my parents’ generation it was the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on December 7, 1941.&nbsp; Since September 11, the United States has been engaged in fighting three wars simultaneously – in Afghanistan, in Iraq, and against terrorism on a global basis, especially the dark forces of Al Qaeda.</p><p>As you leave the safe confines of Bryant, you are entering a world that has become truly global in the four years since you started here.&nbsp; As Thomas Friedman wrote in his recent book, <em>The World Is Flat</em>, while the U.S. has been recovering from 9/11, Enron and the dot com bust, advances in telecommunications technology, the internet, and the breaking down of barriers to free trade and globalization have given three billion people – yes, I meant <em>billion</em> – the potential to enter the world’s workforce and compete for many of the same jobs you are competing for – people from China, India, Russia, Southeast Asia, and Latin America.</p><em>The World Is Flat</em><em>billion</em><p>No, except for a select number of their “best and brightest,” these people won’t be arriving in Providence en masse to fill out application forms to work for Aetna, or competing against you for jobs at Merrill Lynch in New York City. It is much more challenging than that: they will be competing against you for jobs from Bangalore, Shanghai, and Hanoi.&nbsp; The irony is that they never have to leave their village or hometown, they can earn 20% of what you make, and because they can live for a fraction of your cost of living, they can have a high standard of living and high quality of life.</p><p>Global companies that see this change as a threat instead of an opportunity and seek the protection of our borders are sealing their own death warrant.&nbsp; May I cite General Motors as one such company, whose high costs of just about everything from steel to health care combined with a massive loss of market share, may well not exist in its present form five to ten years from today.&nbsp; After all, icons of my youth like AT&amp;T and Sears Roebuck have disappeared in the last three years.</p><p>So how will you compete in   this new world?&nbsp; I offer three important ideas for you to consider:</p><p>1. Continue to build your knowledge and your skills   by embarking on a program of lifelong learning.</p><p>2. Make a difference in every job you are in, no matter how small your area of responsibility, by being innovative and creative.</p><p>3. Become an authentic leader.</p><p>Lifelong   Learning<br> Your learning should not and cannot end with your graduation today.&nbsp; In fact, you should consider your sheepskin as “the end of the beginning.”&nbsp; The world moves so fast today and technology and knowledge are advancing so rapidly that you have to spend several hours each day informing yourself and building your knowledge base just to keep up!&nbsp; It’s not a question of renewing your education when you hit forty – you need to do it every day!</p><br><p>You know by now just what a competitive world it is out there, far more so than when I was getting out of school.&nbsp; If you don’t believe me, just talk to many of my mentees who are outstanding young women and men and were not able to get into the business schools of their choice.&nbsp; You need to continually develop your skills and your capabilities, not just to keep up with your career challenges, but to excel in every position you hold.</p><p>You also should be broadening your base of knowledge, not just deepening it.&nbsp; This will prepare you for new career opportunities, both with the organization you work for and in future organizations you may join.</p><p>Making a   Difference<br> You <em>can</em> make a difference from the first day you enter the workforce.&nbsp; Don’t wait to be asked.&nbsp; Find an opportunity, dive in, and stand out!&nbsp; Business leaders are looking for people that are innovative, creative, and willing to take risks to do things in a creative way.&nbsp; You don’t have to be an executive for this to happen.&nbsp; Your positive attitude alone rubs off on everyone around you and enables you to shine.&nbsp; It makes people want to help you, to support your efforts, and to see you get ahead.</p><br><em>can</em><p>There are many people in organizations that have a dour attitude, that feel like they are victims of life, oppressed by management, leadership, their background, the system, or whatever the excuse of the day is.&nbsp; No matter how talented you are, that kind of attitude can only lead you to frustration and for people not to want to deal with you or see you succeed.</p><p>These days no one has a right to a job, or even to keep their job: we all have to earn our paycheck every single day.&nbsp; At Medtronic I was careful to check out how a person’s subordinates felt about them <em>before</em> they were considered for a promotion, and personally made sure we were not advancing people that had bad attitudes or weren’t committed to the best interests of the company and their colleagues.&nbsp; Corporate politicians simply did not make it at Medtronic, and eventually found the door going out, not the elevator going up.</p><em>before</em><p>Besides, life is about making a difference in every environment we are in – from our families, to our friendships, to our communities, to our jobs.&nbsp; Many people go through life waiting for the world to find them.&nbsp; They may have a very long wait. One day they will wake up and wonder why the world passed them by.&nbsp; Don’t wait!&nbsp; Step up now!&nbsp; Dive in and make a difference from today forward.</p><p>A word on innovation – it’s the key to competing with those three billion people from developing countries.&nbsp; They may have just as much ability as you have, and just as good an education.&nbsp; But one of the greatest blessings of this country is the way we encourage innovation and creativity, the ability to try something entirely different, and find a way to make it successful, even if it has to go through several iterations of failing first.</p><p>Earl Bakken, the founder of Medtronic found that after he invented the world’s first pacemaker: his product had to go through many iterations before it became effective, from a large wearable device to the small implantable device of today.&nbsp; In the meantime he and his fledgling company almost went bankrupt: in fact, they were technically bankrupt, but too proud to declare it. So Bakken sat down and wrote the Medtronic mission, focusing the company on restoring people to full life and health. He used to the mission to bring in one of first venture capitalists to bail out his company.&nbsp; Within months the company turned profitable and never reported another loss. Today Medtronic ranks as the 36th most valuable company in the U.S.</p><p>Look for ways to be innovative and creative: that’s where the jobs and the opportunities are.&nbsp; Examine Howard Schultz who founded Starbucks.&nbsp; No one else believed you could sell a cup of coffee for $3.00. Schultz set out to prove it could be done, and today his company is worth $21B.&nbsp; Or Naryana Murthy, who invested a few thousand dollars to found a software company doing outsourcing for major global companies. Twenty years later his company, Infosys, is one of the largest in India and is worth $18 billion.&nbsp; Or Mike Dell, who dropped out of his pre-med program at the University of Texas, to set up a computer repair shop that grew into the world’s largest personal computer company.&nbsp; His personal net worth is $18 billion.</p><p>What do Bakken, Schultz, Murthy, and Dell have in common?&nbsp; All are courageous, innovative leaders willing to “march to the beat of a different drummer.”&nbsp; They go against the established way of doing things, and use their creativity to make a difference in the world.</p><p>Authentic   Leadership<br> Do you want to become a leader?&nbsp; If so, what kind of leader will you become?&nbsp; What will be the purpose of <em>your </em>leadership?</p><br><em>your </em><p>These are important questions for you to ponder now, even if you have not held any significant leadership roles or don’t see yourself as a leader.&nbsp; For starters I urge you not to think of leaders just at the top of organizations, but leaders in <em>every</em> walk of life at <em>every</em> level.&nbsp; The parent who gives up her or his career to raise the family is just as much a leader, albeit in a different way, as the CEO of an organization.&nbsp; So is the Medtronic production worker who notices a discoloration in the heart values and stops the production to get it fixed before a defective product winds up in someone’s body?&nbsp; Or the leader of an inner city boy and girls club.</p><em>every</em><em>every</em><p>As you think about seeing opportunities to lead, and wondering whether to raise your hand, ask yourself these two questions:</p><p><em>If not me, then   who?</em></p><em>If not me, then   who?</em><p><em>If not now, then   when?</em></p><em>If not now, then   when?</em><p>The world’s needs your leadership today!&nbsp; We have far too few leaders that are willing to be genuine, authentic people, able to rally a group of people to take on a challenge and succeed.</p><p>Many people want to sit back and let others lead, and then analyze and criticize their actions.&nbsp; But as former President Theodore Roosevelt said in his 1908 speech at the Sorbonne in Paris:</p><p><em>“It is not the critic who counts, not the one who points out how the strong man stumbled or how the doer of deeds might have done them better.&nbsp; The credit belongs to the one who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred with sweat and dust and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, if he wins, knows the triumph of high achievement; and who, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.”</em></p><em>“It is not the critic who counts, not the one who points out how the strong man stumbled or how the doer of deeds might have done them better.&nbsp; The credit belongs to the one who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred with sweat and dust and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, if he wins, knows the triumph of high achievement; and who, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.”</em><p>Will you be that kind of leader?&nbsp; Will you step up to the challenge?&nbsp; Will you get into the arena and get your face bloodied?&nbsp; Or will you hang back and critique others, and avoid putting yourself on the line?&nbsp; All my years of experience in business, education, and government lead me to just one conclusion: leaders who step up, even if they fail, are the ones who advance and who make the difference in organizations and in the world.</p><p>Don’t wait to be asked: the   world needs your leadership today!</p><p>Perhaps you feel like you weren’t cut out to lead, or that it is risky and arrogant to put your head above the crowd.&nbsp; South African President Nelson Mandela addressed this point in his first inaugural address, quoting from Marianne Williamson,</p><p><em>“Who are you to think   small?&nbsp; You are a child of God? </em></p><em>“Who are you to think   small?&nbsp; You are a child of God? </em><p><em>You are called to make   manifest the glory that is born in each of us.”</em></p><em>You are called to make   manifest the glory that is born in each of us.”</em><p>How will <em>you</em> lead?&nbsp; Will you lead authentically, or will you attempt to emulate others’ leadership and wind up becoming a phony? What will be the principles of your leadership?&nbsp; What values will guide your leadership?&nbsp; What will be your ethical boundaries?</p><em>you</em><p>You don’t need to be handsome or beautiful, powerful or strong.&nbsp; You just need to be yourself and lead in your own way with your unique qualities, your heart and your values.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many would-be leaders are afraid to show their vulnerabilities, their fears, or their hearts.&nbsp; Instead, they attempt to lead with their heads and use their position power to direct others.&nbsp;&nbsp; But they don’t lead anyone, nor do people today respond to this kind of leadership.</p><p>Great leaders know how to rally people around a common cause and the practice of a consistent set of values to produce results far beyond what anyone thought was possible.&nbsp; You can be that kind of leader!&nbsp; You only have to be authentic in your leadership – to be yourself.</p><p>What does it mean to be an authentic leader?&nbsp; First, it means knowing the purpose of your leadership.&nbsp; For if a leader doesn’t know their purpose, why would anyone want to follow them?&nbsp; Many young people haven’t yet found their purpose.&nbsp; That is quite normal at this stage of your life.&nbsp; But the challenge is to seek to find it.&nbsp; It took me twenty years of searching until I arrived at Medtronic’s doorstep and realized this was the place I should have been at all along.</p><p>And as Greek author Nikos   Kazanzakis wrote many years ago,</p><p><em>“Ithaca does not exist.&nbsp;   Only the voyage to Ithaca.” </em></p><em>“Ithaca does not exist.&nbsp;   Only the voyage to Ithaca.” </em><p>In other words it is the journey, not the destination that counts.&nbsp; Don’t search for your whole life for the pot of gold at the end of your rainbow. Live the beauty of its colors reflected on you every day.&nbsp; Along the way keep searching for the purpose of your leadership and I assure you, you will find it at the right time.</p><p>Second, practice your values every day.&nbsp; Don’t say one thing and do other.&nbsp; Better to say nothing at all.&nbsp; People observe how you act, not what you say you believe.&nbsp; In thinking about your values, can you pass these two tests, “the mirror test” and “the New York Times test?”&nbsp; Look at the woman or the man in the mirror every day:&nbsp; are you proud of the person you are becoming?&nbsp; Are you proud of your behavior?&nbsp; You may fool others but you cannot fool the person in that mirror.&nbsp; And would you be proud to have the actions of your life published on the front page of the New York Times.&nbsp; Think about that <em>before</em> you act, not after.</p><em>before</em><p>Third, as a leader, lead with your heart, not just your head.&nbsp; Have passion for your work, have compassion for the people you encounter along the way, and have the courage to go in a different direction, to march to the beat of a different drummer.&nbsp; And then you will connect with others at the heart level, where real trust is built.</p><p>Fourth, build long-term, enduring relationships, not superficial friendships.&nbsp; What will your relationship be with your friends from Bryant at your twentieth reunion?&nbsp; Will you maintain and sustain those friendships?&nbsp; When you get to be my age, I think you’ll find that the long-term friendships are the ones you really value.&nbsp; In my case I still get together with a group of my college friends annually after all these years.&nbsp; I also have a men’s group with whom I have met weekly for the last thirty years, and a couples group that has met monthly for twenty-two years.&nbsp; Their friendship, advice and caring have been invaluable in my life.</p><p>And finally, have the self-discipline in your life to get results.&nbsp; All these other qualities won’t matter if you do not exhibit the self-discipline to fulfill your commitments to yourself and to others, and to get the results you desire.</p><p>If you can be genuine with others, and practice these five dimensions of an authentic leader—knowing your purpose, practicing your values, leading with your heart, building enduring relationships, and having self-discipline, I have no doubt that you will be an authentic leader throughout your life.&nbsp; Not sometime in the future, but starting <em>now</em>.</p><em>now</em><p>In thinking about the   purpose of your leadership, consider these words from Pablo Neruda, the Chilean   poet:</p><p><em>Something ignited in my   soul, fever or unremembered wings, </em></p><em>Something ignited in my   soul, fever or unremembered wings, </em><p><em>And I went my own way,   deciphering that burning fire.</em></p><em>And I went my own way,   deciphering that burning fire.</em><p>Will <em>you</em> go your own way?&nbsp; Do you feel that fire burning inside your soul?&nbsp; Do you have the passion to make a difference in the world?</p><em>you</em><p>My generation was inspired and motivated by a young President, John F. Kennedy, who said in his inaugural address, “The torch has now been passed to a new generation of Americans.”&nbsp; Many responded to his call to serve their country in small ways and large.&nbsp; Just as it was forty years ago, the torch is again being passed to a new generation.&nbsp; To your generation of emerging leaders the trumpet has sounded.&nbsp; If you listen carefully, you will hear the clarion call to lead in a different way than my generation has:</p><p>To be motivated by your   mission, not your money.</p><p>To tap into your values, not   your ego.</p><p>To connect with others through   your heart, not your persona.</p><p>To live your life with such   discipline that you would be proud to read about your behavior on the front page   of the <em>New York Times</em>.</p><em>New York Times</em><p>As a leader, your task is to engage the hearts of those you serve and align their interests with the interests of the organization you lead.&nbsp; Engaging the hearts of others requires a sense of purpose and an understanding of where you’re going.&nbsp; When you find that special alignment, you and your team will have the power to move mountains.&nbsp; Nothing will be able to stand in your way.</p><p>What Is Your   Unique Calling?</p><p>Recently, a young leader complained that his generation seemed to lack any causes to be passionate about.&nbsp; I suggested that he open his eyes and observe the world around him.&nbsp; Seeing the human needs out there doesn’t take a magnifying glass.&nbsp; You don’t have to look far to see:</p><p>The pain and suffering caused   by poverty, abuse and discrimination.</p><p>The need for healing, in body   and in spirit.</p><p>The desire for healthy   families.</p><p>The decline in our environment   and our natural resources.</p><p>The hunger for security and a   sense of   well-being.</p><p>Do any of these challenges strike a resonance deep within you? Can you find your passion and couple it with your ability to make a difference in the world?</p><p>Reducing poverty . . .</p><p>Eliminating abuse . . .</p><p>Stopping discrimination . .   .</p><p>Helping others heal . .   .</p><p>Restoring our environment . .   .</p><p>Building organizations   dedicated to service . . .</p><p>Feeling safe and secure . .   .</p><p>Helping people develop   themselves . . .</p><p>Improving quality of life for   others . . .</p><p>Bringing joy to the   world?</p><p>What will be your legacy?&nbsp; At the end of your days, what will you tell your granddaughter you did to better humankind?&nbsp; No matter how small or large a difference you make, it will become your legacy that you leave to the world.</p><p>Consider these paradoxes as you   think about where to devote your passions:</p><p>We live in a world of enormous   wealth, yet three-quarters of the world’s population has barely enough to   survive.</p><p>With our greater affluence has   come increased mental and physical abuse of the helpless and vulnerable.</p><p>Forty years after the civil   rights movement began, discrimination is still rampant at all levels of our   society.</p><p>We have the greatest medical   technology in history, yet the rate of disease continues to   grow.</p><p>We abuse our natural resources and ignore the growing contamination of our rivers, our open spaces, our cities, and our environment.</p><p>We no longer feel safe or   secure in our cities after dark.</p><p>We stand idly by as our leaders   focus more on serving themselves than their customers.</p><p>We merge companies to create ever-larger organizations and then treat the people who made them successful as if they were robots.</p><p>We treat quality of life as if   it were a distraction from the real work of people.</p><p>We ignore the deeper meanings   of life and the source of all joy.</p><p>As an authentic leader, you <em>can</em> change these things.&nbsp; You <em>only</em> need to be your own person, lead in your own style with purpose and passion, be true to your values, build your relationships, practice self-discipline, and lead with your heart.</p><em>can</em><em>only</em><p>As much as we want to insure a happy, secure future for our families and ourselves, we have learned the hard way that money alone is insufficient to provide either security or happiness.&nbsp; But making a difference in the lives of others can bring unlimited joy.&nbsp; Leading a life of significant service can bring unlimited fulfillment.&nbsp; Sharing your authentic self with others can bring unlimited love.</p><p>At the end of the day, what is more important in your life than joy, fulfillment, and love?&nbsp; When you find them, you will know that your life has meaning and that you are making a difference in the world.&nbsp; In the end the only thing you can take with you when you depart from this world is what you leave behind.</p><p>Thank you, and Godspeed, as you   go forth into the exciting life that lies just ahead of you.</p>"

      "<p>A Call for Authentic Leadership:<br> Reflections of a former   CEO<br> <em>CEO </em>Magazine – December   2003</p><br><br><em>CEO </em><p>An open letter to my   fellow CEOs:</p><p>I write this letter with all due humility, recognizing that I’ve been out of the CEO’s chair for more than two years and knowing just how much the job has changed in that short period of time. I miss the daily interaction with my former customers and employees, but I sure don’t miss the quarterly earnings call. Good performance never seems to be good enough, even in a recession.</p><p>The last two years – ever since the Enron scandal broke and the economy turned down – have been rough ones. People are coming at us from all sides, and no one seems to appreciate just how tough it is to satisfy all our constituencies. The media seem to be more interested in uncovering yet another set of misdeeds than they are in reporting real business news.</p><p>While we are taking extraordinary steps to comply with Sarbanes-Oxley, the governance gurus are focused more on their own ratings systems and their latest proposals for additional laws. Most of those voices sniping at us out there have never been in the pilot’s seat. They have never had to get the plane off the ground, stay on a steady course, or make a smooth landing.</p><p>The same applies to our shareholders. When the experts talk about serving your shareholders, which shareholders should you listen to? The most vocal of them are the speculators, the hedge funds, and the day traders. Or the short sellers who love to work with their favorite news writer to start an insidious rumor to get your stock price to go down ? Or the security analysts who aren’t shareholders at all ?</p><p>Each of these groups has its own motivation and its own agenda. Most of them are interested only in short-term results, not the fundamentals of building the business. Nor are they responsible for the outcomes, or for preserving and building the enterprise.</p><p>We know how to play this game, but it’s a   game we can’t win in the long run.</p><p>Perhaps we’re playing the wrong game.   Focusing on “maximizing shareholder value” will never create <em>lasting </em>value for the long-term. And it certainly won’t motivate employees to provide customers with innovative products and superior service.</p><em>lasting </em><p>The time is long overdue to stop trying to   manage the business to meet <em>their </em>expectations and to focus on building our businesses and our organizations for the long-term. We should forget about flying coast to coast to speak at security analysts’ conferences and drop the quarterly modeling calls. (Let the analysts figure out their own models.) With the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, I realize now that I spent way too much time while I was CEO speaking at analysts’ meetings and being on CNBC and CNN – and it never moved Medtronic’s stock one dime.</p><em>their </em><p>As CEOs, we don’t design anything, make anything, or sell anything. Our job is to create the strategies for building the business and to create the kind of positive environment that enables our employees to do their jobs. The <em>only </em>way to build lasting value in our companies is to focus on our missions, our customers and our employees. Ironically, by focusing less on getting the stock price up, and more on our customers and employees, in the end we will create far more lasting shareholder value.</p><em>only </em><p>How is lasting shareholder value created?</p><p>•&nbsp; By building your business for the   long-term by pursuing your mission with a passion.</p><p>•&nbsp; By being out with your customers looking   for great ideas for growing your business.</p><p>•&nbsp; By being true to your core values in your   every decision.</p><p>•&nbsp; By connecting every day in a meaningful   way with your employees.</p><p>•&nbsp; By building an enduring organization of   authentic leaders from top to bottom.</p><p>•&nbsp; By getting results for <em>all </em>your   stakeholders, not just the shareholder of the last five minutes.</p><em>all </em><p>That’s what I call authentic leadership. I wrote my book, “Authentic Leadership,” to say to the emerging leaders in your company that there <em>is </em>a better way to lead our companies than many in my generation have demonstrated. In doing the six things listed above, authentic leaders provide the role model for their employees every day of the kind of leaders they should be.</p><em>is </em><p>To sustain increases in shareholder value, we need to spend a lot more time developing the next generation of authentic leaders <em>within </em>our companies. Failure of management to develop outstanding successors has forced far too many boards to look outside for the next chief executive. While there have been some notable successes with outside hires like Lou Gerstner at IBM and Jim McNerney at 3M, far more have failed because they do not fully understand the business or appreciate the organization’s culture and history.</p><em>within </em><p>In leadership development programs far too much attention is being paid to evaluating and honing leadership style and image, managerial techniques, and communications skills of our high potential people. In many organizations we even force our highest potential leaders to conform to the organization’s norms, thus draining them of their best leadership qualities. Earlier in my career, I received a lot of coaching along these lines, but I cannot honestly say it helped me become a better leader.</p><p>Instead, we should focus on identifying and developing those internal leaders that have the character, values, wisdom, and depth to lead the organization in the future. We should encourage them to be their own person and lead in their unique style, while following their values and the “true north” of their moral compass.</p><p>We need to transform our leadership development programs, providing experiential learning courses focused on developing the leader within. To solidify Medtronic’s values among our leadership team, we created two educational programs to reinforce the values-centered culture. For executives, we initiated the Medtronic Values and Ethics Seminar, focused on great books and the discussion of modern ethical issues, like universal health care and euthanasia. Based on the program’s success, we made it the capstone of Medtronic’s education programs for all officers.</p><p>For high talent managers around the world, Medtronic created an educational course called The Medtronic Leader. The program focuses on leadership from the heart and developing the qualities of a leader, utilizing experiential learning. Enabling people to go inside to learn more about themselves, their strengths and weaknesses, and their impact on others is an important element of their leadership development.</p><p>In addition to off-site education, we should be putting high potential leaders in those crucibles that give them the seminal experiences to learn their own mistakes and failures, and find their true leadership capacity from within. This means leaving them in challenging jobs much longer and judging them by their ability to build businesses and face their own mistakes, not just produce short-term numbers.</p><p>When I joined Medtronic, we had a talented rising leader that had been promoted every twelve to eighteen months throughout her career. Instead, we asked her to build Medtronic’s defibrillator business, which she did for six years with spectacular results. Had she continued to “move through the chairs,” she would not have learned nearly as much as she did in taking a very complex business from ground zero to $1 billion in revenues.</p><p>This approach to developing authentic leaders has worked for decades in the top twenty leadership development companies like Johnson &amp; Johnson that were highlighted in this October’s issue of CEO Magazine . Not surprisingly, these twenty companies are ranked at the top of the great shareholder value creators of the past decade, even after the fallout from the recent recession.</p><p>Building lasting shareholder value results from building a team of authentic leaders throughout your company, much more so than hitting <em>someone else’s </em>expectations every quarter.</p><em>someone else’s </em><p>Thanks for listening.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Bill George</p><p>Former Chair &amp; CEO of Medtronic and</p><p>Author of <em>Authentic Leadership</em></p><em>Authentic Leadership</em>"

      "<p>Finding Your True North:<br> The   Spirituality of Authentic Leaders<br> Address by Bill George<br> Professor, Harvard Business School<br> Francis   Greenwood Peabody Lecture<br> At The Memorial Church, Harvard   University</p><br><br><br><br><br><p>Friday, April 13, 2007</p><p>It is a privilege to have the opportunity to give the Francis Greenwood Peabody Lecture here at the Harvard Memorial Church. My sincere thanks to Reverend Peter Gomes for inviting me to do so and for offering that most warm introduction. The title of my lecture is “Finding Your True North: The Spirituality of Authentic Leaders.”</p><p>For the past month I have been traveling   throughout the United States, talking about my new book, <em>True North: Discover   Your Authentic Leadership.</em> I have titled these talks, “Leadership in the 21st Century,” because I feel so strongly that we are in a leadership crisis and need a new generation of leaders to bring us out of it. This evening I would like to go deeper into the source of our leadership – or our True North – and explore the spirituality of authentic leaders.</p><em>True North: Discover   Your Authentic Leadership.</em><p>My lecture is based on the verses from the   Gospel of Matthew in the fifth chapter:</p><blockquote>\n<p><em>Let your shine so shine before men,<br> That they may see your good works,<br> And give glory to your Father who is   in Heaven.</em></p>\n</blockquote><p><em>Let your shine so shine before men,<br> That they may see your good works,<br> And give glory to your Father who is   in Heaven.</em></p><em>Let your shine so shine before men,<br> That they may see your good works,<br> And give glory to your Father who is   in Heaven.</em><br><br><p>The Leadership Crisis in   America<br> America today faces a major crisis in leadership that spans the fields of politics, government, business, non-profits, education and religion. Confidence in our leaders, especially in business and politics, has fallen to an all-time low. Recent surveys by the Gallup poll show that only 22 percent of Americans trust our business leaders, and even fewer trust our political leaders. That’s not just a problem – it represents the potential for disaster.</p><br><p>In part, the problem comes from a wrongheaded notion of what constitutes a leader, driven by an obsession with leaders at the top. In far too many cases we have selected the wrong people to lead and given them far too much power, which they have frequently abused by violating the trust placed in them as leaders. President Abraham Lincoln once said, “If you want to find what a person is made of, give him unlimited power and see how he uses it.” Many of our leaders have abused their power to serve themselves, instead of the people they are called to serve.</p><p>Our democracy and our system of capitalism, in which I believe so fervently, are both based on trust – trust in the institutions that serve us and in their leaders. Democracy is a privilege that must be earned, not a right. When our elected and appointed leaders violate the trust that has been placed in them, they not only destroy the basis for their selection, they put at risk our freedoms and our entire system of governance.</p><p>Through our legal system, society has granted corporations enormous freedom and power to make money for its owners while serving its constituencies and benefiting society as a whole. The freedom that comes with capitalism is not a right, as so many business people seem to believe, but a responsibility that we as leaders are elected to uphold, just as elected political leaders are. If we in the business community violate that trust, we risk losing those privileges and destroying the very system that has made the American economy the most vibrant and enduring in the history of the world. Witness the 2003 Sarbanes-Oxley Act, hastily passed by the U. S. Congress in thirty-one days in response to the crisis of confidence created by the fall of Enron and other companies. Violating the public trust risks the loss of capitalism’s freedoms. In the 1980s I experienced directly how those freedoms can be lost when I was serving on the board of directors of the French computer company, Bull. When Francois Mitterand and his Socialist Party defeated Giscard d’Estaing for the presidency of France, he immediately nationalized France’s twelve leading companies, including Bull, and his government took over the leadership and the board.</p><p>In recent years we have seen many, many leaders violate that trust. Rather than serving others as they are called to do, they seem to be more interested in serving themselves. Their leadership is often characterized by greed, power, and privilege, more than it is by responsibility, empowerment and service.</p><p>The root cause is that we are choosing the wrong leaders for the wrong reasons. All too often business and political leaders are chosen for their charisma instead of their character, for their style rather than their substance, and for the image rather than their integrity. If we choose leaders for charisma, style and image, why should we be surprised when these same leaders turn out to lack character, substance and integrity?</p><p>Although it may seem oversimplified, I believe you can divide all leaders into two categories, takers and givers. The takers are out to take as much as they can from the system. They see the role of their followers as a means to gain greater power, money, fame and glory. Although takers may use “we” in their language, for them in reality it is all about “I.”</p><p>Givers, on the other hand, recognize that being given the privilege to lead is a deep responsibility, one that must never be abused or taken advantage of. As management scholar Peter Drucker once said, “Leadership is responsibility.” In my view, being selected to lead is a noble and sacred calling, one that must never be taken advantage of. If as leaders we wind up serving only ourselves, we have indeed failed in our responsibilities as leaders.</p><p>As a student at Harvard Business School in the mid-1960s, I was in charge of the Musser Seminars on “Business and Christian Ethics,” which included students from the divinity school, business school, and the Episcopal Theological School. One of our guest speakers was Robert Greenleaf of AT&amp;T, who introduced the notion of “servant leadership”—that to be called to leadership is a calling to serve others.</p><p>New Leadership for the 21st   Century<br> I believe we need a new kind of leader to lead our institutions in the 21st century: a leader who can empower and inspire others to lead. The 20th century vision of a leader who commands the troops to follow him over the hill to build his glory is dead – or it should be!</p><br><p>Coming out of two world wars in the 1950s, we idolized all-powerful leaders like General George Patton, in spite of their evident flaws and abusive tendencies. We dichotomized leaders and workers, with the latter being mere cogs in the wheels of production. In the last two decades of the 20th century we developed a national obsession with the all-powerful charismatic leader at the top.</p><p>It is high time that we cast off these images of the all-powerful leaders on top who dominate their subordinates with power, intimidation, and a directive style. We do not need leaders who treat the people as a cost of doing business rather than the basis for the business’ success. No longer can we tolerate leaders who increase earnings by eliminating what has made the organization successful, while they personally reap hundreds of millions in compensation. Employees, customers, investors, and the public at large have every reason not to trust these vestiges of failed 20th century leadership.</p><p>Leadership in this new century must change precisely because the nature of people in organizations has changed. People today are more knowledgeable about their jobs than their bosses are. They are demanding meaning and significance from their work, and are not willing to toil away just for someone else’s benefit. They want to lead now, not wait in line for ten to twenty years until they are tapped for a leadership role.</p><p>Why shouldn’t they expect and demand this   level of respect and meaning? Why shouldn’t you?<br> You can discover your   authentic leadership right now.<br> You do not have to be born with the   characteristics or traits of a leader.<br> You do not have to wait for a tap on   the shoulder.<br> You can step up to lead at any point in your life.<br> You are   never too young – or too old.<br> As Stephen Covey has said, “Leadership is your   choice, not your title.”</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><p>I would like to offer a new definition of   successful 21st century leaders. They are <em>authentic leaders who bring people together around a shared mission and values and empower them to lead, in order to serve their customers while creating value for all their stakeholders. </em></p><em>authentic leaders who bring people together around a shared mission and values and empower them to lead, in order to serve their customers while creating value for all their stakeholders. </em><p> <em>True North: Discovering Your   Authentic Leadership</em><br> I wrote my new book, <em>True   North</em>, to answer the question, “How do you become an authentic leader?” The answer is that it takes years of hard work and development. The key is knowing the True North of your internal compass, and then staying on course in spite of the challenges and seductions that cause so many leaders to go astray.</p><em>True North: Discovering Your   Authentic Leadership</em><br><em>True   North</em><p>What is <em>your</em> True North? When you discover it, you also discover your calling to lead and to serve. Do you know what your life and your leadership are all about, and when you are being true to yourself?</p><em>your</em><p>Your True North represents who you are as a human being at your deepest level, your most cherished values, your passions and motivations, and the sources of satisfaction in your life. When you follow your True North, your leadership will be authentic, and people will naturally want to associate with you.</p><p>Discovering your True North takes a lifetime of commitment and learning. Each day, as you are tested in the real world, you yearn to look at yourself in the mirror and respect the person you see and the life you have chosen to lead. As long as you are true to who you are, you can cope with the most difficult circumstances that life presents.</p><p>In reality, the world may have very different expectations for your leadership than you have for yourself. You will be pressured by external forces to respond to their needs and seduced by rewards for fulfilling them. Regardless of whether you are leading a small team or are at the top of a very powerful organization, you will be pressured by external forces to respond to their needs and seduced by rewards for fulfilling those needs. These pressures and seductions may cause you to detour from your True North. When you get too far off course, your internal compass tells you something is wrong and you need to reorient yourself. It requires strength of character, courage, and resolve to resist these constant pressures and take corrective action when necessary.</p><p>Brenda Barnes, the CEO of Sara Lee Corporation, says, “The most important thing about your leadership is your character and the values that guide your life. If you are guided by an inner moral compass that represents your character and the values that guide your decisions, you’re going to be fine. Let your values guide your actions and don’t ever lose your internal compass, because everything is not black and white. There are a lot of gray areas in life.”</p><p>When you are aligned with who you are, you sense coherence between your life story and your leadership. As psychologist William James wrote a century ago, “The best way to define a person’s character is to seek out the time when he felt most deeply and intensely active and alive; when he could hear his inner voice saying, ‘This is the real me.’”</p><p>Can you recall a time when you felt most intensely alive and could say with confidence, “This is the real me”? When you can, you are aligned with your True North and prepared to lead others authentically. In my own case I had that precise feeling the first time I walked into Medtronic in 1989 and felt I could be myself and be appreciated for who I was and what I could contribute. I sensed immediately that the organization’s values were aligned with my own.</p><p>The Source of Your True   North<br> Let’s probe deeper into what we mean by True North and its source. Your True North begins with the gifts you were given at birth by your Creator. Unless you are so arrogant to believe that you created yourself, you can recognize that they are indeed gifts—gifts that must be nurtured and developed in order to be fully utilized.</p><br><p>I believe we are all called to use our gifts to make the world a better place. This does not mean that our journey through life will be easy. In fact, our lives will most likely be filled with many highs and lows and many ups and downs. As I have discovered the hard way, life is not always fair. Good things do not always happen to good people. This is the reality of life. Going one step deeper into this paradox, I believe that it is only in confronting life’s challenges that we grow as real human beings – vulnerable, humble and open to stepping up to lead in order to use our gifts to serve others.</p><p>To illustrate these points, let me tell you about the story of the gifts I have been given, the challenges and tragedies I have had to overcome, and how I perceive my calling in life. All of this has been integral to discovering my True North.</p><p>As a young person, I was inspired by the   words of Jesus in the Gospel of Matthew (Matt 5: 14-16):</p><blockquote>\n<p><em>You are the light of the world.<br> A city   set on a hill cannot be hidden. . .<br> Let your shine so shine before men,<br> That they may see your good works,<br> And give glory to your Father who is   in Heaven. </em></p>\n</blockquote><p><em>You are the light of the world.<br> A city   set on a hill cannot be hidden. . .<br> Let your shine so shine before men,<br> That they may see your good works,<br> And give glory to your Father who is   in Heaven. </em></p><em>You are the light of the world.<br> A city   set on a hill cannot be hidden. . .<br> Let your shine so shine before men,<br> That they may see your good works,<br> And give glory to your Father who is   in Heaven. </em><br><br><br><br><p>Nearly all of us experience a crucible at some point in our lives that tests our limits and enables us to discover who we really are. In my case it took a series of crucibles before I learned that my mission was not to become CEO of a global company, but to build an organization that could help other people through its life-saving products.</p><p>In my teenage years, I was trying so hard to be a leader that I lost seven elections in a row. Thanks to a caring group in my college fraternity, I learned that my ambitions and selfish ways were blocking my ability to use my leadership gifts. Understanding that was the easy part; much more difficult was developing into a leader that truly cared about serving other people. In my mid-twenties the back-to-back deaths of my mother and my fiancée brought me to the depth of loneliness that caused me to explore deeply what life is all about. But it was not until I “hit the wall” in my career at Honeywell in my mid-forties that I finally recognized the deeper purpose of my leadership. It was not just to be CEO, but to join a unique company like Medtronic whose mission was to restore people to full life and health. Had it not been for the counsel and advice of my wife Penny, and my men’s group, I might never have come to that realization.</p><p>Discovering Your True   North<br> Discovering your True North to become an authentic leader is a long journey that takes hard work on your part, just as it does to become a virtuoso violin player or a champion athlete. As GE’s Jeff Immelt told us, “Leadership is one of those great journeys into your soul. It’s not like anyone can tell you how to do it.”</p><br><p>In studying leaders who have failed, I realized that their failure resulted from their inability to lead themselves. As we discerned from our interviews,<em> the hardest person you will ever have to   lead is yourself</em>. When you can lead yourself through the challenges and difficulties, you will find that leading others becomes relatively straight-forward.</p><em> the hardest person you will ever have to   lead is yourself</em><p>Leading yourself starts with understanding your life story, your unique gifts, the challenges and crucibles your have face, and the source of your passion to lead others and to contribute to the world. In interviewing 125 authentic leaders, we learned that their calling to lead emanated from their life stories.</p><p>One of these leaders was Wendy Kopp. Wendy grew up in a middle class family in Dallas and attended an excellent suburban high school. But when she got to Princeton, she realized that many of her classmates who came from inner city neighborhoods never had the opportunity for a decent education. She became passionate about correcting these inequities in education. In her senior year as she was attending an education conference, an idea struck her. Why not have a teachers’ corps, much like the Peace Corps, of recent college graduates who would teach for two years in inner city schools and transform education? Her idea let to the formation of Teach For America. Sixteen years later, after overcoming repeated obstacles and barriers, Teach For America has become the most successful education program in the U.S., all because of Wendy’s Kopp passion and her calling to make a difference in the world.</p><p>One of the most moving crucible stories came from Novartis chairman and CEO Dan Vasella, whose early life traumas of spending a year in a sanatorium at age eight and the subsequent deaths of his sister and his father motivated him to become a compassionate physician who could lead a global healthcare company that could help millions of people every year.</p><p>Oprah Winfrey talked openly about her experiences of being sexually abused, starting at nine years old. Reframing her experiences enabled her to become not just a television celebrity, but a caring leader whose mission is to help people take responsibility for their lives.</p><p>When you understand your life story and experience life’s challenges, you can find your passions to lead and, in turn, the purpose of your leadership. This is what I consider is your calling to lead.</p><p>What do you have to do to develop yourself? In our Harvard study of 125 authentic leaders, we learned that there are six principle areas required to lead yourself:<br> Gaining self-awareness<br> Practicing your values and principles under pressure<br> Balancing your   extrinsic and intrinsic motivations<br> Building your support team<br> Staying   grounded by integrating your life<br> Understanding your passions and purpose of   your leadership</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><p>Self-Awareness<br> It may take a lifetime to gain complete awareness of yourself, but your self-knowledge can be accelerated by honest feedback from others. In his mid-thirties Doug Baker, Jr. was a rising star at Ecolab who had taken over the company’s newly acquired subsidiary in North Carolina. Through his early success, Baker had become arrogant and self-centered. Then he got some tough feedback from his subordinates that told him all of this and more. Baker calls getting the unexpected criticism “a cathartic experience.” He explained, “It was as if someone flashed a mirror in front of me at my absolute worst. What I saw was horrifying, but it was also a great lesson. After that, I did a lot of soul-searching about what kind of leader I was going to be, talked to everyone on my Ecolab team about what I had learned, and asked them for their help.” Baker’s self-awareness is a critical factor in the success he is realizing since becoming CEO of Ecolab nine years later.</p><br><p>Practicing Your   Values<br> The key to your values is not what you say you believe in, or even how you behave when things are going well. You really find out what your values are when you are under pressure or things are not going your way.</p><br><p>Today Jon Huntsman is the successful founder of Huntsman Chemical, leader of a 73-person family, and a bishop in his Mormon church. In 1973 he was a young staffer working for President Nixon’s notoriously powerful chief of staff, Bob Haldeman. One day Haldeman directed Huntsman to carry out an undercover sting operation involving illegal immigrants designed to embarrass a Congressman opposing Nixon’s initiatives. At first, Huntsman went along with the game, calling the plant manager to give him instructions. He recalled, “There are times when we react too quickly and fail to realize immediately what is right and wrong. This was one of those times when I didn’t think it through. After fifteen minutes, my inner moral compass kicked in and I told the plant manager, ‘Forget that I called. I don’t want to play this game.’” Huntsman recognized that rejecting the orders of the second most powerful person in the country would be viewed as disloyal and his White House career would be over. “So be it,” he said, “I quit in the next six months.”</p><p>Balancing Your   Motivations<br> It is not surprising that leaders like promotions, bonuses and pay increases, and recognition from their peers and the media. But if these motivations dominate their passions, they are at risk of derailing, sooner or later. Authentic leaders recognize their intrinsic motivations like helping others, making a difference in the world, and building organizations with purpose and meaning. The important thing is not to deny your extrinsic motivations, but to balance them with intrinsic motivations.</p><br><p>Kevin Sharer was a rising star at General Electric at age 41, general manager of its satellite business, and on Jack Welch’s “high potential list.” When the search firms proposed to Kevin that he join MCI with a faster route to the top, he jumped at the opportunity, leaving Welch unhappy with his sudden departure. Once at MCI, Kevin learned quickly that the COO was in line for the top slot and didn’t welcome the new hotshot from GE. His “know-it-all” attitude didn’t help either, especially when he proposed reorganizing the company. Sharer’s crucible at MCI proved invaluable to him: caught up in the glamour of being a rising star, he was brought down to reality and forced to recognize what really motivated him. When the opportunity to become COO of Amgen, Sharer recognized the importance of Amgen’s work in saving lives. He earnestly studied biology and the biotech business for seven years before becoming CEO. By then, he was able to balance his extrinsic motivations with the intrinsic satisfactions that Amgen’s mission provided him.</p><p>Building Your Support   Team<em><br> </em>An essential element of staying focused on your True North is to build a support team that can help you stay on track. Your team starts with having at least one person in your life with whom you can be completely open and honest. It could be your spouse, best friend, mentor, or therapist. In my case, that person is my wife Penny, who is largely responsible for whatever success I have enjoyed. She keeps me on track, especially when I get caught up in selfish desires. Your family and your best friends also help you stay grounded, especially when you most need their help. Having a mentor who can give you straight feedback can be invaluable.</p><em><br> </em><br><p>I also believe in having a support group of your peers with whom you can share openly and who will be there for you when you most need them. I have been blessed with having a men’s prayer group with whom I have been meeting every Wednesday morning for the last thirty years, as well as a couples group that Penny and I helped form twenty years ago. These two groups of people have been there for me when I most needed their support. When Penny was diagnosed with breast cancer eleven years ago, they were there to support both of us through the difficult times that followed.</p><p>The reality is you cannot wait to build your support team until you are facing difficulty. The time to do it is now, because long-term, deep relationships and shared life histories take decades to build.</p><p> Staying Grounded by Integrating   Your Life<br> Every leader I know is facing the challenges of meeting all their commitments in life – their jobs, their families and their communities as well as preserving time for their personal life. I can assure you, this isn’t getting any easier, as the work week seems to be increasing. How do you stay grounded with all the pressures coming at you? I think the key is maintaining your integrity by being the same person in all these environments, and not letting your leadership commitments at work pull you away from the fullness of life. This isn’t easy, but it can be done by making choices and setting boundaries, and not selling your soul to your job. If you don’t do these things, you may become a shooting star that burns out long before you have the opportunity to fulfill your leadership dreams.</p><br><p>Your Passions Reveal the Purpose of   Your Leadership<br> Finally, when you understand the passions that emanate from your life story, you will discover the purpose of your leadership – in other words, your True North will become clear. I learned that when I made the decision to leave Honeywell and join Medtronic.</p><br><p>Andrea Jung, who is CEO of Avon Products, was a rising star at Neiman-Marcus as executive VP in her early thirties, when she decided she did not want to spend her life selling high-fashion designs to upper class women, so she resigned without another job. Joining Avon Products, she found her passions and her leadership purpose to help other women. Upon becoming CEO, after being passed over the first time around, she immediately changed Avon’s mission from selling cosmetics to the empowerment of women. Under her leadership Avon has gone from 1.5 million to 5.5 million people working for the company and achieving economic independence and success through their efforts. As she said, “If people cannot see my passion for this business, it is impossible to be their leader.”</p><p>Empowering People to   Lead<br> Developing yourself as these leaders have done is not an easy task. It is a marathon, not a sprint, to gain self-awareness, solidify your values, balance your motivations, build your support team, integrate your life, and understand the purpose of your leadership. As you do so, you will find that leading others is relatively straight-forward. By being authentic and true to your beliefs, you can unite people around a common purpose and set of values and empower them to step up and lead. That’s what the best 21st century leaders are doing, and the reason why their organizations over the long-term far outperform organizations led by people still operating in the 20th century mold.</p><br><p>When Anne Mulcahy became CEO of Xerox, she took over a company close to bankruptcy with $18 billion in debt, yet she had no financial experience. What she brought to the job was an incredible commitment to Xerox and its people and 25 years of building relationships. She met individually with the top 100 people and asked for their commitment to do whatever was necessary to restore Xerox to its former greatness. Her empowering style enabled her to motivate her team not only to save the company but to rebuild it into a great organization.</p><p>Your Call to Experience the   Fulfillment of True North Leadership<br> In his inaugural address, Nelson Mandela used a quote from Marianne Williamson that captures beautifully the challenge that many of us face in deciding whether to step up to leadership:</p><br><p><em>Our deepest fear is not that we are   inadequate.<br> Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.<br> It is   our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.<br> We ask ourselves, who am   I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?<br> Actually, who are you not to   be?<br> You are a child of God.<br> Your playing small does not serve the   world.<br> There is nothing enlightened about shrinking,<br> So that other people   won’t feel insecure around you.<br> We are born to manifest the glory of God that   is within us.<br> It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone.<br> And as we   let our own light shine,<br> We unconsciously give other people permission to do   the same<br> As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically   liberates others.<br> </em><br> When we examine organizations that are led by empowering leaders, we realize that we do not have a shortage of leaders after all. In every organization there are many, many leaders just waiting for the opportunity to lead.</p><em>Our deepest fear is not that we are   inadequate.<br> Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.<br> It is   our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.<br> We ask ourselves, who am   I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?<br> Actually, who are you not to   be?<br> You are a child of God.<br> Your playing small does not serve the   world.<br> There is nothing enlightened about shrinking,<br> So that other people   won’t feel insecure around you.<br> We are born to manifest the glory of God that   is within us.<br> It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone.<br> And as we   let our own light shine,<br> We unconsciously give other people permission to do   the same<br> As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically   liberates others.<br> </em><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><p>My advice is, don’t wait to be asked. You can step up and lead right now. Your organization will be far better off because you did. In thinking about whether to take on the leadership challenges, ask yourself these two simple questions,</p><p><em>If not me, then who? If not now,   then when?</em></p><em>If not me, then who? If not now,   then when?</em><p>As President Theodore Roosevelt said in his   famous 1908 address,</p><p><em>The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows the triumph of high achievement and who if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</em></p><em>The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows the triumph of high achievement and who if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly; so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.</em><p>Are you prepared to enter that arena, to dare greatly, and to spend yourself in a worthy cause? If you are, in the end you will know the triumph of high achievement and the joy of working with a passionate group of people toward shared goals, of confronting challenges and overcoming barriers, and of leaving a legacy to the world through your leadership. There is no satisfaction in your professional life that can compare to this sense of fulfillment.</p><p>You will have the satisfaction of knowing that you followed your True North, you discovered your authentic leadership, and the world is a better place because of you. That is the fulfillment of being a True North leader.</p>"

      "<h2>Crisis in Corporate Ethics: Where Have All the Leaders Gone?</h2><p>An Address by Bill George<br>\nformer Chair &amp; CEO, Medtronic<br>\nWestminster Town Hall Forum<br>\nFebruary 13, 2003</p><br><br><br><h3>Introduction</h3><p>Last week’s tragic loss of the Columbia brought back vivid memories of my teenage years when the Soviet Union launched Sputnik. Not long thereafter, the United States made a major commitment to exploring outer space. A vital young President, John F. Kennedy, had the vision and foresight to commit our nation to a challenge no one knew how to do: putting a man on the moon by 1969.</p><p>My generation was deeply inspired by the words of President Kennedy’s inaugural address, “Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country.” As Kennedy said, “The torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans.” No one in my generation will ever forget where we were on that fateful day in November 1963, when we learned that the President had been assassinated, just as the younger generation will always remembers where they were when they learned that an airplane had flown into the World Trade Center .</p><p>In spite of our leader’s death, many of us idealistically took the torch that Kennedy spoke of and to set out to show what we could do for our country. I was one of them. I decided to concentrate my efforts on the world of business because the enormous capacity of the free enterprise system to organize people to make a difference in the lives of the people it serves. In those days I had a vision of becoming an ethical, values-centered leader running a major corporation, and, rather immodestly, influencing my peers to be ethical and values-centered.</p><p>Looking back at my thirty-two years in the active world of business, I realize just how fortunate I was to have the opportunity to reach my first goal in leading such a special company as Medtronic, and how little influence I had in influencing others in my generation. The complete collapse of corporate governance and the extreme greed of certain corporate leaders that has been exposed in the past year made that all too clear.</p><p>While a graduate student at Harvard, I led the Musser Seminars on “Business and Christian Ethics.” Students from the Business School , Divinity School , and the Episcopal Theological Seminary met regularly to discuss weighty ethical topics with leading scholars from around the country. One that had an influence on me was Robert Greenleaf, then an AT&amp;T executive, who presented his ideas on “servant leadership.” Greenleaf proposed that the role of leaders was to serve their followers. At the time this was a radical idea, because we looked at leaders back then as powerful people running large organizations, often in a rather autocratic manner.</p><p>Coming out of business school in 1966, a number of us went to Washington to work in the federal government and help our country. As the Vietnam war escalated, it didn’t take long for our idealism to be shattered. Vietnam was followed in the 1970s by Watergate and in the 1980s by the takeovers and junk bond scandals. But for a business person, all of these events pale by comparison to the corporate ethical crisis we have experienced in the past year.</p><p>Thank you, Enron and Arthur Andersen.</p><p>The depth of their misconduct shocked the world and awakened us to the reality that the business world was on the wrong track, worshiping the wrong idols, and headed for self-destruction. Like the proverbial frog that dies when temperatures are gradually increased, but immediately jumps out when tossed into a boiling pot of water, it took this kind of shock therapy for us to realize that something is sorely missing in many of our corporations. What’s missing? Ethical, values-based leaders.</p><p>What began as a few executives charged with violating the law morphed into issues of corporate governance and the failure of our governance systems. As we understand the issues at a deeper level, we realize that the missing ingredients in corporations are ethical leaders committed to building authentic organizations for the long-term.</p><p>Every generation has corporate thieves who break the law to reward themselves. This time around the excesses are not limited to a few. I believe deeply that the vast majority of corporate CEOs are honest leaders dedicated to building their companies. Unfortunately, far too many got caught up by the short-term pressures of the stock market and the opportunities it brought for personal wealth. Under these pressures and the quest for personal gain, they wound up sacrificing their values and their stakeholders.</p><p>Our system of capitalism is built on trust – trust that corporate leaders and boards of directors will be good stewards of their resources, providing investors with a fair return. There can be no doubt that many leaders have violated that trust. As a result, investors lost confidence and withdrew from the market. In the process, many people got hurt, not just the perpetrators.</p><p>In the midst of the current crisis, we must ask ourselves, <em>where have all the leaders gone? </em>Where are today’s versions of James Burke of Johnson &amp; Johnson, Walter Wriston of Citicorp, John Whitehead of Goldman Sachs, and David Packard of Hewlett-Packard? These people not only built great enterprises but were statesmen in the business community and leaders in addressing societal issues as well.</p><em>where have all the leaders gone? </em><p>In contrast, most of today’s leaders of our best-run corporations remain silent. Are they afraid that by speaking out they may invite scrutiny of their companies? In so doing, they give the impression that they have something to hide or are also part of the problem. Only a few CEOs, such as Henry Paulson of Goldman Sachs and Henry McKinnell of Pfizer, have been willing to condemn these practices publicly, recognizing the larger issue is one of public trust in the capitalist system. Paulson’s acts were doubly courageous, as he risked not only criticism from his peers but his customers as well. Andy Grove, chairman of Intel, commented recently, “I find myself embarrassed and ashamed to be a businessman.”</p><h3>Capitalism Becomes the Victim of its Own Success</h3><p>How did we get in this situation? Is this a recent phenomenon, or have these activities been going on all along?</p><p>We are witnessing the excesses of the shareholder revolution that began fifteen years ago. In its early stages, pressure from shareholders did much to improve the competitiveness of American corporations, as companies trimmed unnecessary expenses, improved profitability, and increased cash flow. However, the financial rewards from their actions, both corporate and personal, were so great that companies and shareholders alike developed an inordinate focus on short-run results. In a booming stock market, it all seemed to be working.</p><p>Then capitalism became the victim of its own success. Instead of focusing on traditional measures such as growth, cash flow, and return on investment, the criterion for success became meeting the expectations of the security analysts. Investments were cut back in order to make earnings, limiting the company’s growth potential. Driven by the speculators and security analysts, expectations kept rising, just as companies were struggling to make their numbers. Companies that met or exceeded the “magic” earnings number were handsomely rewarded with ever-rising stock prices. Those that fell short, even if they recorded substantial increases, were inordinately punished, and shareholders demanded replacement of the CEO. No wonder many CEOs went to extreme measures to satisfy shareholders!</p><p>However, revenues and earnings do not escalate forever, especially in the face of economic downturns, events like September 11, and operating problems. To offset financial problems, many executives stretched the numbers and the accounting rules well beyond their intended limits. Some of these accounting schemes, like calling operating expenses capital equipment to avoid the P&amp;L and booking revenues before they are earned, violate even the most basic rules of accounting. Now the chickens are coming home to roost.</p><p>In the past five years stock options went from modest grants to mega-grants for top executives, especially CEOs. Because they had no cash impact and were not charged against profits, many executives and boards viewed these grants as free. The effect was to shift the CEO’s focus almost entirely to getting the stock price up – by whatever means necessary. Realizing they could not sustain their earnings, many CEOs cashed in their options for huge gains just before their stock collapsed.</p><p>The general public played a role in this tragedy as well. In idealizing the high-profile personalities that ran these companies, we made them into heroes. We equated wealth with success and image with leadership. To our dismay, we have learned that these celebrity CEOs have been filling up their personal coffers at their shareholders’ expense, while destroying the pensions and life savings of thousands of people.</p><p>The media turned these short-term earnings artists into the folk heroes of the business community. While making wealth, image, and star power the criteria for success, the media overlooked the many solid corporate leaders building quality companies for the long-term. Ken Lay, Bernie Ebbers, and Dennis Koslowski were the focus of intense media worship before their fall. Just one year before he was led off to jail in handcuffs, <em>Business Week </em>put Koslowski on its cover as the CEO of the top company on its Nifty Fifty list of top stock performers. These three executives alone have destroyed over $300 billion in shareholder value.</p><em>Business Week </em><p>Back in 1998 I met with one of these leaders to talk about acquiring one of his companies. In our brief meeting he explained how his off-shore headquarters enabled his company to avoid U.S. taxes, how he automatically issued pink slips to twenty-five per cent of the workers on the day he acquired their company, and how he shut down every research project or investment that didn’t pay off in the first year. As I walked out of his office, I held onto my wallet and decided to cancel further talks with him. You cannot do business with people you do not trust.</p><h3>The Case for New Leadership</h3><p>In response to the violations, policy makers and politicians have crafted new laws and regulations to close the loopholes. While some changes in regulations are appropriate and necessary, they do not address the deeper issues at stake here. It is impossible to legislate integrity, stewardship, and sound governance.</p><p>Somewhere along the way we lost sight of the imperative of selecting ethical leaders that create healthy corporations for the long-term. The lessons of building great companies like 3M, Coca-Cola, Johnson &amp; Johnson, General Electric, Pfizer, and Procter &amp; Gamble were lost in the rush to get the stock price up. We forgot that those of us who are fortunate enough to lead great companies are the stewards of legacies we inherited from past leaders and the servants of our stakeholders.</p><p>The lessons from this crisis are evident: if we select people principally for their charisma and their ability to drive up their short-term stock price instead of their character, and shower them with inordinate rewards, why should we be surprised when they turn out to lack integrity? We do not need executives running corporations into the ground in search of personal gain. We do not need celebrities to lead our companies <em>. </em>We do not need more laws.</p><em>. </em><p><em>We need a new kind of leader. </em></p><em>We need a new kind of leader. </em><p>We need authentic leaders, people of the highest integrity, committed to building enduring organizations. We need leaders who have a deep sense of purpose and are true to their core values. We need leaders with the courage to build their companies to meet the needs of all their stakeholders, and who recognize the importance of their service to society.</p><h3>The Temptations of Leadership</h3><p>Leading an organization, large or small, is no easy task. It can be lonely at times. Meeting the varied needs of the people you serve is a continuing struggle. Leaders are pulled in many different directions, yet must keep a clear vision of where they and their organizations are headed.</p><p>Congressman Amory Houghton, one of the most thoughtful members of the U.S. Congress, tells the story of his predecessor’s advice as he was taking over as CEO of Corning Glass. “Think of your decisions being based on two concentric circles. In the outer circle are all the laws, regulations, and ethical standards to which the company must comply. In the inner circle are your core values. Just be darn sure that your decisions as CEO stay within your inner circle.”</p><p>We are all painfully aware of corporate leaders that pushed beyond the outer circle and got caught, either by the law or by the financial failures of their companies. More worrisome are the leaders of companies who moved outside their inner circles and engaged in marginal practices, albeit legal ones. Examples include cutting back your company’s long-term investments just to make the short-term numbers, bending compensation rules to pay executives in spite of marginal performance, using accounting tricks to meet the quarterly expectations of security analysts, shipping products of marginal quality, compromising security analysts by giving them a cut on investment banking deals, and booking revenues before they are shipped in order to pump up revenue growth. The list goes on and on.</p><p>All of us who sit in the leader’s chair feel the pressure to perform. As CEO, I felt it every day as problems mounted or sales lagged. I knew that the livelihood of tens of thousands of employees, the health of millions of patients, and the financial fortunes of millions of investors rested on my shoulders and those of our executive team. At the same time I was well aware of the penalties for not performing, even for a single quarter. No CEO wants to appear on CNBC to explain why his company missed the earnings projections, even by a penny.</p><p>Little by little, step by step, the pressures to succeed can pull us away from our core values, just as we are reinforced by our “success” in the market. The irony is the more successful we are, the more we are tempted to take shortcuts to keep it going. The rewards – compensation increases, stock option gains, a myriad of executive perquisites, positive stories in the media, admiring comments from our peers – reinforce our actions and drive us to keep it going.</p><p>In a recent interview with Fortune magazine, Novartis CEO Daniel Vasella talked about these pressures: “Once you get under the domination of making the quarter – even unwittingly – you start to compromise in the gray areas of your business, that cut across the wide swath of terrain between the top and the bottom. Perhaps you’ll begin to sacrifice things that are important and may be vital for your company over the long-term. . . The culprit that drives this cycle isn’t the fear of failure so much as it is the craving for success. For the tyranny of quarterly earnings is a tyranny that is imposed from within. . . For many of us the idea of being a successful manager is an intoxicating one. It is a pattern of celebration leading to belief, leading to distortion. When you achieve good results, you are typically celebrated, and you begin to believe that the figure at the center of all that champagne toasting is yourself. You are idealized by the outside world, and there is a natural tendency to believe that what is written is true.”</p><p>Like Vasella, who is one of the finest leaders I know, all leaders have to resist these pressures while continuing to perform, especially when things aren’t going well. The test I used with our team at Medtronic is whether we would feel comfortable having the entire story appear on the front page of the New York Times . If we didn’t, we went back to the drawing boards and re-examined our decision.</p><h3>Developing Solid Values</h3><p>Leaders are defined by their values and their character. The values of the ethical leader are shaped by one’s personal beliefs, developed through study, introspection, consultation with others – and a lifetime of experience. These values define the leader’s moral compass. Ethical leaders know the “true north” of their compass, the difference between right and wrong and the deep sense of the right thing to do. Without a moral compass, leaders can wind up like the executives who are facing possible prison sentences.</p><p>This doesn’t just happen by listing your values. You have to test your values in the crucible of life’s experiences. Only in the crucible will you learn how to cope with pressures to compromise your values and deal with potential conflicts between them. You have to put yourself in situations in which your values are challenged and make difficult decisions in the context of your values. This is not easy when the outcome is uncertain and there is a lot at stake. It is in these situations that you find the “true north” of your moral compass.</p><p>While the development of fundamental values is crucial, integrity is the one value that is required in every leader. Integrity is not just the absence of lying, but telling the whole truth, as painful as it may be. Without complete integrity in your interactions, no one can trust you. If they cannot trust you, why would they ever follow you?</p><p>I once had a colleague who would never lie to me, but often he shared only positive parts of the story, sheltering me from the ugly side. Finally, I told him that real integrity meant giving me the whole story so that together we could make sound decisions. Rather than thinking less of him, I would have a higher opinion of his courage and integrity.</p><p>When asked about their ethics, most leaders espouse solid values. Many of them meet regularly with their employees and implore them to practice these values or risk losing their jobs. Under pressure, these same leaders may behave in an entirely different manner. There is nothing worse than leaders who preach good values but fail to follow their own advice, or who set double standards for their employees and themselves. If you want to see employees become cynical, just watch what happens when the top executives behave in ways inconsistent with company values. For one example, look at Dennis Koslowski, former CEO of Tyco, who set up an endowed chair in corporate governance at Cambridge University in the U.K., just as he was demolishing any semblance of sound governance on his own board.</p><p>Many business schools and academic institutions do not teach values as part of leadership development. Some offer ethics courses, often in a theoretical context, but shy away from discussing values. Others assume erroneously their students already have well solidified values. What they fail to realize is the impact that your environment has in shaping your values and the importance of solidifying your values through study and dialogue.</p><p>As Enron was collapsing in the fall of 2001, the Boston Globe published an article by a classmate of Enron CEO Jeff Skilling. The author described how Skilling would argue in class that the role of the business leader was to take advantage of loopholes in regulations and push beyond the laws wherever he could to make money. As Skilling saw the world, it was the job of the regulators to try and catch him. Sound familiar? Twenty-five years later, Skilling’s philosophy caught up with him, as his company tumbled into bankruptcy.</p><p>Max DePree, the former CEO of furniture maker Herman Miller is a superb example of an ethical, values-centered leader. DePree is a modest man guided by a deep concern for serving others who is true to his values in every aspect of his life. His humanity and values can be seen through the exemplary way in which his company conducts itself. DePree describes his philosophy of values-centered leadership in his classic book, Leadership Is an Art . DePree also subscribes to Greenleaf’s ideas on servant leadership, and expands them by offering his own advice, “The leader’s first job is to define reality. The last is to say thank you. In between the leader must become a servant and a debtor.”</p><p>DePree believes that a corporation should be “a community of people,” all of whom have value and share in the fruits of their collective labor. DePree practices what he preaches. While CEO, his salary was capped at twenty times that of an hourly worker. In his view tying the CEO’s salary to his workers helps cement trust in leadership. Contrast that with today’s CEOs, who are earning – on average – four to five hundred times their hourly workers. As DePree said recently, “When leaders indulge themselves with lavish perks and the trappings of power, they are damaging their standing as leaders.”</p><h3>Leading With Heart</h3><p>Over the last several decades, businesses have evolved from maximizing the physical output of their workers to engaging the minds of their employees. To excel in the 21 st century, great companies will go one step further by engaging the hearts of their employees through a sense of purpose. When employees believe has their work has a deeper purpose, their results will vastly exceed those who use only their minds and their bodies. This will become the company’s competitive advantage.</p><p>Sometimes we refer to people as being “big hearted.” What we really mean is that they are open and willing to share themselves fully with us, and are genuinely interested in us. Leaders who do that, like Sam Walton, founder of WalMart, and Earl Bakken, founder of Medtronic, have the ability to ignite the souls of their employees to achieve greatness far beyond what anyone imagined possible.</p><p>One of the most heartfelt leaders I know is Marilyn Nelson, chair and CEO of the Carlson Companies, the privately held hospitality and travel services giant. When she became CEO several years ago, she inherited an organization that was driven for growth but not known for empathy for customers and employees. Shortly after taking over as CEO, Nelson had her “epiphany.” She was meeting with the group of MBA students that had been studying the company’s culture. In asking the students for feedback, Nelson got a stony silence from the group. Finally, a young woman raised her hand and said, “We hear from employees that Carlson is a sweatshop that doesn’t care.”</p><p>That incident sent Nelson into high gear. She immediately set out to change the environment, using her passion, motivational skills, and sincere interest in her employees and her customers. She created a motivational program called “Carlson Cares,” as she became the company’s role model for caring and empathy. She took the lead on customer sales calls and interacted every day with employees in Carlson operations. Her positive energy has transformed the company’s culture, built its customer relationships, accelerated its growth, and strengthened its bottom line.</p><p>Mother Theresa is a compelling example of a leader who led with her heart. Many think of her as simply a nun who reached out to the poor, yet by 1990 she had created an organization of four thousand missionaries operating in one hundred countries. Her organization, Missionaries of Charity, began in Calcutta and spread to 450 centers around the world. Its mission was “to reach out to the destitute on the streets, offering wholehearted service to the poorest of the poor.” I doubt that any of us will ever be like Mother Theresa, but her life is indeed an inspiration.</p><h3>IN THE CRUCIBLE</h3><p>In his recent book, <em>Geeks and Geezers</em>, author Warren Bennis observes that most of his interviewees passed through a crucible that tested them to the depths of their being and empowered the successes they realized later in life. At some time in your journey you, too, may find yourself in a crucible that really tests your values. In this crucible you learn who you are and what you want to become. Without it, you cannot be certain how you will respond under extreme pressure and whether you will be true to your values. Having survived the crucible, you will know that indeed you can take on any challenge and come out of it a better person for the experience.</p><em>Geeks and Geezers</em><p>My wife Penny experienced her crucible in 1996 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She went through a modified radical mastectomy, seven months of chemotherapy, five years of hormonal therapy, and a lifetime of not knowing whether the cancer would recur. At first, she was convinced she was going to die. Gradually, she took back control of her life by creating her own healing path.</p><p>One of the steps on her journey was to participate in a Vision Quest in southwestern Utah . A Vision Quest is an experience based on the rituals of indigenous people in which participants seek to understand their purpose in the world. Fasting alone for four days and nights in the desert, Penny found a new power within her and a renewed sense of purpose for her life. Several months afterward, she gave up her practice of psychology and devoted herself to the cause of integrative medicine, using the mind, body, heart and spirit on one’s healing journey. With passion and purpose, she is now working with medical leaders throughout the U.S. to change the way medicine is taught and practiced. Her inner power is enabling her to take on leadership roles she never believed she was capable of.</p><p>Four-time Tour de France winner Lance Armstrong makes a dramatic – almost unbelievable – statement in his book, It’s Not About the Bike, about his battle with life-threatening cancer. “The truth is, if you asked me to choose between winning the Tour de France and cancer, I would choose cancer.” He goes on to explain, “Odd as it sounds, I would rather have the title of cancer survivor than winner of the Tour, because of what it has done for me as a human being, a man, a husband, a son, and a father.”</p><p>Last fall I had the opportunity to bike with Lance up to the Maroon Bells near Aspen and to ask him about his views on cancer. He explained how his battle with cancer had transformed him as a person and opened up his opportunities for marriage, fatherhood and, yes, giving him the focus and discipline to win the Tour four times in a row. He told me he wrote the book not to glorify his achievements – “those will soon be forgotten” – but to give hope to millions of cancer sufferers.</p><h3>Shooting Stars and Golden Boys</h3><p>Some rising leaders avoid challenging experiences that really test them. I refer to them as Shooting Stars and Golden Boys. The Shooting Stars move up so rapidly they never take time to learn from their mistakes or look themselves in the mirror. A year or two into any job, they are ready to move on, long before they have to pass the test of living with their decisions. When they see an experience like the crucible coming, their anxiety rises and so does the urgency to move on. If their employer doesn’t move them upward, they are off to the next company. Then some day they find themselves at the top, confronted with ethical challenges and an overwhelming set of problems. Without the wisdom of the crucible, they cannot cope and are prone to do bizarre things on their way to self-destruction.</p><p>The Golden Boy follows a similar path to success, using his charm, style and good looks to get ahead. He always sets the bar of performance low enough to insure that he can exceed it. To outsiders and board members, he always appears in control. Insiders observe that he never gets his hands dirty wrestling with problems. When he reaches the top, he is unprepared for the real-world challenges he will encounter. When faced with them, he is vulnerable to making major mistakes and putting his company at risk.</p><p>“Hitting The Wall”: My Time In The Crucible<br>\nMy most agonizing time in the career crucible also came when I least expected it. I call this “hitting the wall,” something that happens to most leaders at least once in their careers. As painful as it was, this experience provided the basis for growth and change that transformed my career. It caused me to look inside myself, acknowledge my shortcomings, and realize I was on the wrong path.</p><br><p>In the mid-1980s I was on my way to the top of Honeywell. What began as a huge promotion turned into a decision to reassess my career and to move in an entirely new direction. By 1988 I had been promoted several times, each time taking over more responsibility for Honeywell’s most challenging businesses. At the time I was responsible for three groups, nine divisions, 18,000 employees, and a raft of problems.</p><p>I had developed a reputation as “Mr. Fixit,” the guy who could get Honeywell’s troubled businesses turned around. I knew how to turn businesses around, but it never excited me. During this period I started questioning whether Honeywell was really the place for me. I felt out of sync with Honeywell’s slow-moving, change-resistant culture. I was becoming more concerned with appearances and my attire than just being myself. Reluctantly, I faced the reality that Honeywell was changing me more than I was changing Honeywell.</p><p>I had “hit the wall,” but was too proud to face it. I felt in a trap from which I couldn’t escape. On a beautiful fall afternoon when the maple trees were blazing red, I had a daydream driving around the lake near my home. But this dream was not pretty. I saw myself staying at Honeywell for a few more years, becoming increasingly frustrated, and then deciding to accept a CEO position at a large company in some other city. This would mean uprooting my family, Penny giving up her job, our sons changing schools, and all of us leaving the community we loved. Why would I do that? Just to satisfy my ego? I had a lot of self-explanation to do.</p><p>My experience that day enabled me to realize that I needed to overcome my fixation on being CEO of a very large corporation. I realized I was letting my ego get in the way of my values. If indeed I was in a trap, it was a trap of my own making. When we are in this position, it is difficult to see things clearly, and we may miss the opportunity staring us in the face.</p><p>Over the years I had three opportunities to join Medtronic, dating back to 1978. I turned them all down, mostly because I didn’t feel Medtronic was a large enough company for me. Yet the opportunity kept nagging at me. Had I done the right thing? It finally dawned on me that I was so caught up in my drive to run a major corporation that I was in danger of losing my soul. In the process I realized I had sold Medtronic short, and maybe myself as well. That evening Penny and I had a long talk about our lives and our careers. We recognized that my lack of fulfillment in my job was having a negative impact on all of us. She encouraged me to take another look at Medtronic.</p><p>I kept thinking about the vision I had in my teenage years: leading a mission-driven, values-centered company where I was passionate about the opportunity to serve others. What better place to do that than Medtronic? I called Medtronic CEO Win Wallin and reopened the door. Five months later I walked through Medtronic’s door as the new president. Rarely in life do we get the opportunity four times.</p><p>Throughout my life I have had a passion to make a difference in the world. At Medtronic I was able to lead a company that changes people’s lives. I feel a deep sense of good fortune in finding a confluence of interests between my personal desires and the needs of Medtronic. The Medtronic mission to restore people to fuller health inspired me from the moment Medtronic Founder Earl Bakken described it to me. Fourteen years later, it inspires me even more.</p><h3>Ethical Dilemmas: When in Rome, Don’t Follow the Romans</h3><p>Many leaders believe ethics is a topic that is discussed in business schools but not a part of everyday business. In fact, ethical dilemmas and pitfalls surround most significant decisions that a business leader makes. Sometimes these issues are moral, sometimes legal, and sometimes personal. Often the most significant challenge in dealing with ethical dilemmas is recognizing them to begin with and then confronting them in business decisions.</p><p>Most companies have clear statements of values and ethical codes of conduct that their employees must sign. In spite of these declarations, neither the organization’s nor its leaders’ ethical practices are established until they are tested under difficult conditions in the market. How leaders respond to these challenges, as painful as they may be, sets the ethical tone for the entire organization and establishes the company’s true values, much more than written statements, compliance documents, and training sessions.</p><p>Late in my time at Litton Industries the corporate board visited our microwave oven division to understand the reasons for our exceptional growth record. As I was presenting our international expansion strategy and our worldwide standard of ethics, I noticed the independent directors were nodding in agreement, but the new CEO was scowling as though he wished I would move to another topic. At the coffee break I found out why, as I overheard a conversation the CEO was having with the head of the company’s oil exploration business. “Charlie, the audit committee is very upset about your audit report,” he said. “I know you have to do what you have to do to get the business, but if you ever put it writing again, you’re fired!” The message was clear as a bell: it’s okay to make payoffs, but just don’t get caught. That incident convinced me I working for the wrong company.</p><h3>Confronting a Public Crisis</h3><p>Sometimes excellent companies fail to respond to an ethical crisis because they do not grasp its depth or severity, or their leaders choose not to get personally involved. When failures of Firestone tires led to several deaths of people driving the Ford Explorer, the leaders of the two companies choose to blame each other rather than addressing the loss of human life. When the Exxon Valdez ran aground off the coast of Alaska , causing a major oil spill that killed millions of fish and literally wiped out the livelihood of hundreds of fisherman, Exxon’s top management isolated itself in its New York offices and failed to go the scene of the problem. Later a jury assessed $5 billion in damages against Exxon, in part due to its lack of sensitivity to the impact of the tragedy. Even a great company like Intel was slow to recognize its users’ reactions to the flaw in the Pentium chip. Once it did, however, Intel’s positive response preserved its reputation.</p><p>Recently I was discussing the Enron/Arthur Andersen debacle with my MBA students at IMD in Switzerland . I described the tragedy of Arthur Andersen, saying that “you can spend fifty years in establishing your reputation and values and lose it all in a day.” One of the Dutch students responded by saying, “No, Bill, Andersen didn’t lose it all in a day. They sold their soul to their clients over the last five to ten years by compromising their values more and more, just to make money. What looks to you like a giant step in destroying documents was to them just another step in sacrificing values for greed.”</p><p>For a classic case study of how to handle these kinds of crises, look at how the leadership of James Burke, then-CEO of Johnson &amp; Johnson, enabled his company to respond quickly and responsibly to the deaths of several people from terrorists lacing its Tylenol caplets with arsenic. Although J&amp;J bore no responsibility for the incidents, Burke’s very open public response to pull all the product off the market until new packaging could be designed not only saved the brand, it wound up enhancing J&amp;J’s reputation as a responsible company.</p><h4>An Ethical Challenge in Europe</h4><p>To my surprise, I faced a severe ethical test during my first year with Medtronic. As part of my first reorganization, I appointed a new president of Medtronic Europe, who had previously been president of Medtronic’s Dutch pacemaker subsidiary.</p><p>Shortly after taking over, he proposed the acquisition of the subsidiary’s Italian distributor. The price for the business was very high, but he insisted we had to buy it or risk losing the business. During due diligence, Medtronic’s auditors uncovered inappropriate accounting for a sham contract for Italian marketing services. When the controller was asked what the account was for, he refused to answer, saying that it was integral to doing business in Italy .</p><p>After General Counsel Ron Lund brought the issue to me, we hired a special legal investigator. His preliminary report indicated that the funds were traced to a secret Swiss bank account, set up on behalf of the Italian distributor. There the trail stopped. Although he could not prove it, the investigator believed the funds were being used to pay off Italian physicians. At this point we informed the Medtronic board and asked them to set up a special committee to oversee the investigation.</p><p>I called our European president and told him to come to Minneapolis immediately. When asked about the promotion account, he replied, “You don’t want to know about that fund.” I told him that indeed we did. At this point he got very defensive, even hostile, saying, “That’s the trouble you Americans. You’re always trying to impose your values on Europeans. Business is done differently in Europe .” Finally, I said, “These are not American values. They are Medtronic values that apply worldwide. You violated them, and you must resign immediately.”</p><p>At this point we notified all concerned government bodies of our findings. We also put out a press release disclosing them and making it clear that these actions were completely contrary to Medtronic policy. The announcements caused an upheaval among the employees of the Dutch subsidiary. Many felt the terminations were a political action by Medtronic management designed to eliminate their autonomy. After a few weeks, things settled down. For the last twelve years the subsidiary has been an outstanding performer.</p><p>This affair was difficult for me to handle because I had appointed the new European president. I had to acknowledge that I made a huge mistake in not checking out his values <em>beforehand </em>. Correcting someone else’s mistakes is a lot easier than facing your own. It is then that you have to look yourself in the mirror and recognize that you blew it, not someone else.</p><em>beforehand </em><p>When in Rome? Ethical Dilemmas and Global Standards<br>\nAs a student at Harvard Business School , I got into heated debates with classmates about whether U.S. ethical standards should be applied internationally. In the cases we studied it was clear that many non-U.S. companies used a different set of ethical standards in doing business around the globe. So did some U.S. companies. We referred to this as, “When in Rome , do as the Romans do.” In these debates I was a vigorous proponent of a common worldwide ethics standard, arguing that a company would lose business in certain cases, but also gain from having a clean reputation. Looking back, I realize my views haven’t really changed.</p><br><p>One thing that has strengthened my advocacy for a single worldwide standard of ethics is the global nature of business today. Your company’s reputation for integrity, or the lack thereof, travels with you wherever you do business. Having a clear set of standards is easier for international employees to follow than is a flexible standard that adapts to local market conditions. With ultimate responsibility for the actions of employees throughout the world, leaders can sleep a lot better if they know that employees are adhering to a common ethical standard.</p><p>Nevertheless, the temptations to stretch the rules to meet competitive practices are always there, especially in the developing countries. We learned the hard way that upholding an ethical standard takes a lot more than written statements and clear verbal messages. It requires a detailed system of compliance, enforcement, and punishments for improper actions. To make such a system work, employees need to be trained on the standards, using real world examples. Otherwise, there will be misunderstandings or rationalizations about what is acceptable practice.</p><p>The key is having open lines of communications with people on the firing line at the country level. They need to know that top management will support them when they adhere to the standard and lose a contract or a customer. There also has to be a vehicle such as a hot line for employees to inform management confidentially of deviations without fear of retribution.</p><p>When I arrived at Medtronic, I was unprepared for the business conduct problems we encountered early in my tenure. Confronted with them, we took an aggressive, pro-active approach and got them corrected permanently. It took several years to get 100% compliance with our standards for business conduct. These efforts enhanced Medtronic’s reputation around the world and made it easier, not harder, to do business and gain share.</p><p>In retrospect, these ethical problems provided an excellent opportunity to establish clear standards for employees throughout the world. In addressing them before Medtronic’s growth spurt, we were able to expand Medtronic’s global operations with the confidence that the business being generated was sound and all employees were on the same page in terms of ethical standards.</p><p>If Not Me, Then Who? If Not Now, When?</p><p>T.S. Eliot once wrote the lines,</p><p><em>“We shall not cease from exploration, </em></p><em>“We shall not cease from exploration, </em><p><em>And the end of all our exploring, </em></p><em>And the end of all our exploring, </em><p><em>Will be to arrive where we started, </em></p><em>Will be to arrive where we started, </em><p><em>And know the place for the first time.” </em></p><em>And know the place for the first time.” </em><p><em>(from “Four Quartets”) </em></p><em>(from “Four Quartets”) </em><p>In May 1992 my father died in peace at the age of 93 and my older son graduated from high school, all in the same week. For me it was the passing of a generation. As a close friend told me, “Bill, you just moved up to the front pew.”</p><p>It won’t be long until you are asked to move to the front pew and take charge – or perhaps you already have been. My advice is, don’t wait to be asked. Don’t wait until you get the top job.</p><p>In thinking about whether to step up and lead, ask yourself these two simple questions:</p><p><em>If not me, then who? If not now, when? </em></p><em>If not me, then who? If not now, when? </em><p>The world needs <em>your </em>leadership <em>today </em>.</p><em>your </em><em>today </em><p>Being an ethical person in today’s world is not sufficient in itself. As a leader, you have to have the moral courage to step up and take a position, and then be prepared to suffer the wrath of those who disagree or lack to courage to stand-alone against the tide.</p><p>Just as President Kennedy said forty years ago, the torch of leadership is again being passed to a new generation. To your generation, the trumpet has sounded. If you listen carefully, you will hear the clarion call to lead in a different way than many in my generation have:</p><p>To be motivated by your mission, not your money.</p><p>To tap into your values, not your ego.</p><p>To connect with others through your heart, not your persona.</p><p>To live your life with such discipline that you would be proud to read about your behavior on the front page of the <em>New York Times </em>.</p><em>New York Times </em><p>Recently, a young leader complained that his generation seemed to lack any causes to be passionate about. I suggested that he open his eyes and observe the world around him. Seeing the human needs out there doesn’t take a magnifying glass. You don’t have to look far to see:</p><p>The pain and suffering caused by poverty, abuse and discrimination.</p><p>The need for healing, in body and in spirit.</p><p>The desire for healthy families.</p><p>The decline in our environment and our natural resources.</p><p>The hunger for security and a sense of well being.</p><p>Do any of these challenges strike a resonance deep within you? Can you find your passion and couple it with your ability to make a difference in the world?</p><p>Reducing poverty . . .</p><p>Eliminating abuse . . .</p><p>Stopping discrimination . . .</p><p>Helping others heal . . .</p><p>Restoring our environment . . .</p><p>Building organizations dedicated to service . . .</p><p>Feeling safe and secure . . .</p><p>Helping people develop themselves . . .</p><p>Improving quality of life for others . . .</p><p>Bringing joy to the world?</p><p>Consider these challenges society faces as you think about where to devote your passions:</p><p>We live in a world of enormous wealth, yet three-quarters of the world’s population has barely enough to survive.</p><p>With our greater affluence has come increased mental and physical abuse of the helpless and vulnerable.</p><p>Forty years after the civil rights movement began, discrimination is still rampant at all levels of our society.</p><p>We have the greatest medical technology in history, yet the rate of disease continues to grow.</p><p>We abuse our natural resources and ignore the growing contamination of our rivers, our open spaces, our cities, and our environment.</p><p>We no longer feel safe or secure in our cities after dark.</p><p>We stand idly by as our leaders focus more on serving themselves than their customers.</p><p>We merge companies to create ever-larger organizations and then treat the people who made them successful like robots.</p><p>We treat quality of life as if it were a distraction from the real work of people.</p><p>We ignore the deeper meanings of life and the source of all joy.</p><p>As an ethical, values-centered leader, you <em>can </em>change these things. You <em>only </em>need to be your own person, lead with purpose and passion, be true to your values, and lead with your heart.</p><em>can </em><em>only </em><p>As much as we want happy, secure futures for our families and ourselves, we have learned the hard way that money alone is insufficient to provide either security or happiness.</p><p>But making a difference in the lives of others can bring unlimited joy.</p><p>Leading a life of significant service can bring unlimited fulfillment.</p><p>Sharing yourself with others authentically can bring unlimited love.</p><p>What is more important than joy, fulfillment, and love?</p><p>When we experience them, we will arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.</p>"
